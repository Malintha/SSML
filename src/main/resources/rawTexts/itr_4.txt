Domestic and first-class career
Ishant plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and has taken 68 wickets in 14  first-class games, [9] [10] including a five-wicket haul against Baroda on the opening day of a match Delhi drew after failing to bowl Baroda out on the fourth day. [11]
Ishant toured England with the India Under-19s in 2006 and Pakistan in 2006–07. He played three youth tests and six youth One Day Internationals for India. On the basis of his strong performance in Australia in 2008, Ishant Sharma was bought for a winning bid of $950,000 by Kolkata Knight Riders in the player auction for the Indian Premier League . This was the highest amount paid for any bowler in tournament.
International career
Ishant Sharma in 2008
In May 2007, Sharma was selected in the test team for the Bangladesh tour and played as a replacement for the fast bowler Munaf Patel . Over there he played for his national side in the second test where he bowled three overs including one maiden and conceded only five runs without taking a wicket. [12] Later on, he was called for the tour of England in July–August 2007.
Sharma got a call back in the team in the 3rd Test during Pakistan's tour of India in December 2007 due to injury of India's frontline pacers Zaheer Khan , RP Singh , and Sreesanth . [13] Sharma picked up 5 wickets during the third test in Bangalore . [14] This performance earned him a place in India's squad for the tour of Australia.
Sharma was left out in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne during the Border–Gavaskar Trophy as India retained their main fast bowlers, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh. However, in January 2008 Sharma was called to represent India once again to replace the injured Zaheer Khan in the second test at the SCG . Sharma started the first day of the match strongly and was involved in a controversial decision from Steve Bucknor when Andrew Symonds nicked the ball to keeper MS Dhoni off his bowling but was given not out. He bowled reasonably in the match, however without much luck.
Although he had little success, the management retained him for the third Test match at Perth. On the fourth day of the match he bowled an exceptional spell to Australian captain Ricky Ponting that resulted in his wicket and helped India claim victory. [15] He used the pace and bounce of the WACA wicket to trouble the batsmen. In the following test played in Adelaide he picked up two wickets and impressed everyone with his bowling. He finished the tour of Australia with figures of 6/358, an average of 59.66 and a strike rate of 101.0. [16]
On 10 February 2008, Sharma bagged four important wickets in the 4th ODI of CB Series against Australia. He ended the match with figures of 4/38 and named Man of the Match. [17] He scalped two important wickets on 18 February 2008 versus Australia in the 7th ODI of CB series. [18]
During the 2008 Test series against Australia in India , Ishant was the leading wicket-taker, with 16, and was named man-of-the-series as India won 2–0. He thereby became the first Indian paceman to win such an award in a Test series on Indian soil after Kapil Dev who won the award in 1983. He was noted for achieving reverse swing on balls sometimes as young as eight overs, and along with senior opening bowler Zaheer Khan, troubled the touring Australians. [19] He took Australian captain Ricky Ponting's wicket three times during the series, and six times in as many Tests, making the Indian press label Ponting as Ishant's bunny. [20]
However, in 2009, Ishant's form slumped, and he was dropped for the second Test against Sri Lanka, replaced by Sreesanth .
On 5 October 2010, Ishant helped VVS Laxman pull off a highly unlikely win over Australia by one wicket in the first Test in Mohali after India had fallen to 8/124 in pursuit of 205. Ishant provided Laxman with support during an 81-run partnership in which he contributed 31 valuable runs.
Sharma bowling in the nets in 2008
In the 2011 IPL auction, Sharma was bought by the Deccan Chargers ; he hoped that his performance in the competition would give him a chance to impress selectors and push for selection in India's ODI team. [21] From 12 matches, Sharma took 11 wickets at an average of 28.54. [22] A month after the IPL, which was held in April and May, India toured the West Indies for five ODIs and three Tests . Several senior players were rested from the ODI side and others absent through injury; this mostly affected the batsmen but Zaheer Khan missed the ODI series. [23] India won the first three ODIs, and Sharma was called into the team for the fourth, his first ODI since August 2010. [24] [25] He managed one wicket from two matches in the series while conceding 109 runs. [26] The first Test resulted in a win for India and Sharma took three wickets in each innings. [27] He claimed his 100th Test wicket in the second Test, becoming the fifth youngest to reach the landmark; the fixture was also the first time he took ten wickets in a match for India. [28] [29] The second and third Tests ended in draws and India won the series 1–0; [30] Sharma was the leading wicket-taker on either side with 22 dismissals at an average of 16.86. [31]
After the tour of West Indies, India suffer a run of eight consecutive defeats in away Tests. In July and August the team played four Tests in England . England inflicted a 4–0 whitewash on India, [32] and in the process replaced India as No. 1 ranked Test team. [33] Playing in all four matches, Sharma managed 11 wickets at an average pushing 60. [34] During the series Sharma suffered an anckle injury and missed the ODI leg, but was sufficiently reovered to face the West Indies in November when India hosted them for three Tests. [35] While India won 2–0, Sharma managed five wickets from three matches at a cost of in excess of 65 runs each. [36] Sharma played in all four Tests of India's tour of Australia in 2011–12 . India lost the series 4–0, while Sharma took five wickets at the cost of 451 runs. [37]
In March 2012, Sharma underwent surgery on his ankle which had been troubling him for over a year. The operation meant that he missed the 2012 IPL. [38]
In 2013 Ind vs Aus ODI series, he gave away 30 runs in an over, equalling the most expensive over by an Indian bowler. (Yuvraj Singh had conceded 30 runs against England in an ODI match in 2007) [39]
After some bad performances against Australia in 2013 ODI series, he came back strongly against South Africa taking 4/40 in the third ODI on 11 December 2013 at SuperSport Park , which was his 2nd best performance in ODIs. [40]
In the 2014 tour of England , Sharma secured his career best figures of 7/74 at the Lord's , with an aggressive spell in England's second innings, bowling India to a 95-run win. [41] During the first test of the series, Sharma suffered the slight ignominy of becoming Alastair Cook 's sole Test wicket when caught down the leg side. [42] India finished the series losing 3–1. He finished the 2015 three-match Test series in Sri Lanka with 13 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul in the third Test at SSC . At the end of the match, he was handed a one match ban by the International Cricket Council (ICC), following an altercation with Dhammika Prasad in the course of the match. [43] The series also saw him pick his 200th wicket in Tests. [44] India won the series 2–1.
Bowling style
A right arm fast-medium bowler, the speed of Sharma's bowling has diminished since he emerged on the international scene, [45] although in 2008 he bowled a delivery at over 152 kilometres per hour (94 mph). [46] Such occurrences were not the norm as his pace dropped to around 130 km/h (81 mph), but under Eric Simons (who was India's bowling coach from 2010 to 2012) Sharma was regularly bowling in excess of 140 km/h (87 mph) when India toured Australia in 2011/12. [47] [48] According to India's former bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad he is amongst the most dedicated bowler in India's set up. [49]
Simons noted height was a factor in the length Sharma bowled, saying "For Ishant to hit the stumps, he has to pitch it fuller, and that means the batsman has more chance of keeping it out". [4India: 50 runs in 8.6 overs (55 balls), Extras 5

Purposes[ edit ]
The keeper's major function is to stop deliveries that pass the batsman (in order to prevent runs being scored as 'byes'), but he can also attempt to dismiss the batsman in various ways:
The most common dismissal effected by the keeper is for him to catch a ball that has nicked the batsman's bat, called an edge, before it bounces. Sometimes the keeper is also in the best position to catch a ball which has been hit high in the air. More catches are taken by wicket-keepers than by any other fielding position.
The keeper can stump the batsman by using the ball to remove the bails from the stumps , if the batsman has come out of his crease during a delivery.
When the ball is hit into the outfield, the keeper moves close to the stumps to catch the return throw from a fielder and, if possible, to run out a batsman.
A keeper's position depends on the bowler : for fast bowling he will crouch some distance from the stumps, in order to have time to react to edges from the batsman, while for slower bowling, he will come much nearer to the stumps (known as "standing up"), to pressure the batsman into remaining within the crease or risk being stumped. The more skilled the keeper, the faster the bowling to which he is able to "stand up", for instance Godfrey Evans often stood up to Alec Bedser . [3]
Wicket-keeping is a specialist discipline and it requires training consistent with the level expected of a specialist batsman or bowler . However, the modern-day keeper is also expected to possess reasonable batting skill, suiting him for the middle order at least. Wicket-keepers who are also capable of batting at the top of the order are known informally as keeper/batsmen.
Since there is only room for one keeper in a cricket side, selectors (especially at the international level) are often faced with a difficult choice between two or more skilled keepers. Often, one of the two keepers is an exceptional keeper, but only an average batsman, whereas the other is a keeper/batsman who is clearly better at batting, but not quite as good a keeper as his rival. One such selection dilemma was that faced by England selectors in the 1990s between Jack Russell (the pure keeper) and Alec Stewart (the keeper/batsman). They were never able to consistently choose between the two until 1998, when Russell began to fade: prior to that, they had regularly swapped the role, often with Stewart maintaining his place when not wicket-keeping thanks to his batting skill.
The keeper may also have a captaincy role. Uniquely, they are usually involved in every delivery of an innings, and may be in a position to see things that the captain misses. They can frequently be heard encouraging the bowler, and may also indulge in the practice (not meant to be overheard) of " sledging " the batsman with well timed comments about their skill, appearance or personal habits.
The keeper is the only fielder allowed to touch the ball with protective equipment, typically large padded gloves with webbing between the index finger and thumb, but no other webbing. The protection offered by the gloves is not always adequate. The England keeper Alan Knott sometimes placed steaks inside his gloves for added cushioning. Wicket-keepers also tend to wear leg pads and a box to protect the groin area.
Wicket-keepers are allowed to take off their pads and bowl, though this rarely happens but is not uncommon when matches are drifting to draws or a bowling team is desperate for a wicket. Two keepers have removed their pads and taken hat-tricks in first-class cricket: Probir Sen for Bengal v Orissa at Jump to: navigation , search

Main article: History of Australian cricket from 1876–77 to 1890
The Australian cricket team participated in the first Test match at the MCG in 1877, defeating an English team by 45 runs, with Charles Bannerman making the first Test century, a score of 165 retired hurt . Test cricket , which only occurred between Australia and England at the time, was limited by the long distance between the two countries, which would take several months by sea. Despite Australia's much smaller population, the team was very competitive in early games, producing stars such as Jack Blackham , Billy Murdoch , Fred "The Demon" Spofforth , George Bonnor , Percy McDonnell , George Giffen and Charles "The Terror" Turner . Most cricketers at the time were either from New South Wales or Victoria , with the notable exception of George Giffen , the star South Australian all-rounder .
A highlight of Australia's early history was the 1882 Test match against England at The Oval . In this match Fred Spofforth took 7/44 in the game's fourth innings to save the match by preventing England from making their 85-run target. After this match The Sporting Times , a major newspaper in London at the time, printed a mock obituary in which the death of English cricket was proclaimed and the announcement made that "the body was cremated and the ashes taken to Australia." This was the start of the famous Ashes series in which Australia and England play a Test match series to decide the holder of the Ashes. To this day, the contest is one of the fiercest rivalries in sport.
Main articles: History of Australian cricket from 1890–91 to 1900 and History of Australian cricket from 1900–01 to 1918
The so-called 'Golden Age' of Australian test cricket occurred around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, with the team under the captaincy of Joe Darling , Monty Noble and Clem Hill winning eight of ten tours. It participated in between the 1897–98 English tour of Australia and the 1910–11 South African tour of Australia. Outstanding batsman such as Joe Darling , Clem Hill , Reggie Duff , Syd Gregory , Warren Bardsley and Victor Trumper , brilliant all-rounders including Monty Noble , George Giffen , Harry Trott and Warwick Armstrong and excellent bowlers including Ernie Jones , Hugh Trumble , Tibby Cotter , Bill Howell , Jack Saunders and Bill Whitty , all helped Australia to become the dominant cricketing nation for most of this period.
Victor Trumper became one of Australia's first sporting heroes, and was widely considered Australia's greatest batsman before Bradman and one of the most popular players. He played a record (at the time) number of tests at 49, and scored 3163 (another record) runs at a high for the time average of 39.04. His early death in 1915 at the age of 37 from kidney disease caused national mourning. The Wisden Cricketers' Almanack , in its obituary for him, called him Australia's greatest batsman: "Of all the great Australian batsmen Victor Trumper was by general consent the best and most brilliant." [11]
The years leading up to the start of World War I were marred by conflict between the players, led by Clem Hill, Victor Trumper and Frank Laver , the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket . Led by Peter McAlister , who was attempting to gain more control of tours from the players. This led to six leading players (the so-called "Big Six") walking out on the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England, with Australia fielding what was generally considered a second-rate side. This was the last series before the war, and no more cricket was played by Australia for eight years, with Tibby Cotter being killed in Palestine during the war.
Cricket between the wars[ edit ]
Main article: History of Australian cricket from 1918–19 to 1930
Test cricket resumed in the 1920/21 season in Australia with a touring English team , captained by Johnny Douglas losing all five Tests to Australia, captained by the "Big Ship" Warwick Armstrong . Several players from before the war, including Warwick Armstrong, Charlie Macartney , Charles Kelleway , Warren Bardsley and the wicket-keeper Sammy Carter , were instrumental in the team's success, as well as new players Herbie Collins , Jack Ryder , Bert Oldfield , the spinner Arthur Mailey and the so-called "twin destroyers" Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald . The team continued its success on the 1921 Tour of England , winning three out of the five Tests in Warwick Armstrong 's last series. The side was on the whole inconsistent in the latter half of the 1920s, losing its first home Ashes series since the 1911–12 season in 1928–29.
The Bradman Era[ edit ]
Main article: History of Australian cricket from 1930–31 to 1945
The 1930 Tour of England heralded a new age of success for the Australian team. The team, led by Bill Woodfull – the "Great Un-bowlable" – featured legends of the game including Bill Ponsford , Stan McCabe , Clarrie Grimmett and the young pair of Archie Jackson and Don Bradman . Bradman was the outstanding batsman of the series, scoring a record 974 runs, including one century, two double centuries and one triple century , a massive score of 334 at Leeds which including 309 runs in a day. Jackson died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 three years later, after playing eight tests. The team was widely considered unstoppable, winning nine of its next ten Tests.
The 1932–33 England tour of Australia is considered one of the most infamous episodes of cricket, due to the England team's use of bodyline , where captain Douglas Jardine instructed his bowlers Bill Voce and Harold Larwood to bowl fast, short-pitched deliveries aimed at the bodies of the Australian batsmen. The tactic, although effective, was widely considered by Australian crowds as vicious and unsporting. Injuries to Bill Woodfull , who was struck over the heart, and Bert Oldfield , who received a fractured skull (although from a non-Bodyline ball), exacerbated the situation, almost causing a full-scale riot from the 50 000 fans at the Adelaide Oval for the Third Test. The conflict almost escalated into a diplomatic incident between the two countries, as leading Australian political figures, including the Governor of South Australia , Alexander Hore-Ruthven , protested to their English counterparts. The series ended in a 4–1 win for England, but the Bodyline tactics used were banned the year after.
The Australian team managed to overcome the damaging series, winning their next tour of England in 1934. The team was led by Bill Woodfull on his final tour, and was notably dominated by Ponsford and Bradman, who twice put on partnerships of over 380 runs, with Bradman once again scoring a triple-century at Leeds. The bowling was dominated by the spin pair of Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett , who took 53 wickets between them, with O'Reilly twice taking seven wicket hauls.
Sir Donald Bradman is widely considered the greatest batsman of all time. [12] [13] He dominated the sport from 1930 until his retirement in 1948, setting new records for the highest score in a test innings (334 vs England at Headingley in 1930), the most number of runs (6996), the most number of centuries (29), the most number of double centuries and the greatest Test and first-class batting averages. His record for the highest Test batting average – 99.94 – has never been beaten. It is almost 40 runs above the next highest average. He would have finished with an average of over 100 runs per innings if he had not been dismissed for a duck in his last Test. He was knighted in 1949 for services to cricket. He is generally considered one of Australia's greatest sporting heroes.
Test cricket was again interrupted by war , with the last Test series in 1938 made notable by Len Hutton making a world record 364 for England, with Chuck Fleetwood-Smith conceding 298 runs in England's world record total of 7–903. Ross Gregory , a notable young batsman who played two Tests before the war, was killed in the war.
Cricket after World War II[ edit ]
Main article: History of Australian cricket from 1945–46 to 1960
The team continued its success after the end of the Second World War , with the first Test (also Australia's first against New Zealand ) being played in the 1945–46 season against New Zealand. Australia was by far the most successful team of the 1940s, being undefeated throughout the decade, winning two Ashes series against England and its first Test series against India . The team capitalised on its ageing stars Bradman, Sid Barnes , Bill Brown and Lindsay Hassett while new talent, including Ian Johnson , Don Tallon , Arthur Morris , Neil Harvey , Bill Johnston and the fast bowling pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller , who all made their debut in the latter half of the 1940s, and were to form the basis of the team for a good part of the next decade. The team that Don Bradman led to England in 1948 gained the moniker The Invincibles, after going through the tour without losing a single game. Of 31 first-class games played during the tour, they won 23 and drew 8, including winning the five match Test series 4–0, with one draw. The tour was particularly notable for the Fourth Test of the series, in which Australia won by seven wickets chasing a target of 404, setting a new record for the highest runchase in Test cricket, with Arthur Morris and Bradman both scoring centuries, as well as for the final Test in the series, Bradman's last, where he finished with a duck in his last innings after needing only four runs to secure a career average of 100.
Australia was less successful in the 1950s, losing three consecutive Ashes series to England, including a horrendous 1956 Tour of England , where the 'spin twins' Laker and Lock destroyed Australia, taking 61 wickets between them, including Laker taking 19 wickets in the game (a first-class record) at Leeds , a game dubbed Laker's Match.
However, the team rebounded to win five consecutive series in the latter half of the 1950s, first under the leadership of Ian Johnson , then Ian Craig and Richie Benaud . The series against the West Indies in the 1960–61 season was notable for the Tied Test in the first game at The Gabba , which was the first in Test cricket. Australia ended up winning the series 2–1 after a hard fought series that was praised for its excellent standards and sense of fair-play. Stand-out players in that series as well as through the early part of the 1960s were Richie Benaud , who took a then-record number of wickets as a leg-spinner , and who also captained Australia in 28 Tests, including 24 without defeat; Alan Davidson , who became the first player to take 10 wickets and make 100 runs in the same game in the first Test, and was also a notable fast-bowler; Bob Simpson , who also later captained Australia for two different periods of time; Colin McDonald , the first-choice opening batsman for most of the 1950s and early '60s; Norm O'Neill , who made 181 in the Tied Test; Neil Harvey , towards the end of his long career; and Wally Grout , an excellent wicket-keeper who died at the age of 41.
1970s and onward[ edit ]
The Centenary Test was played in March 1977 at the MCG to celebrate 100 years since the first Test was played. Australia ended winning by 45 runs, an identical result to the first Test match. [14]
In May 1977 Kerry Packer announced he was organising a breakaway competition – World Series Cricket (WSC) – after the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) refused to accept Channel Nine 's bid to gain exclusive television rights to Australia's Test matches in 1976. Packer secretly signed leading international cricketers to his competition, including 28 Australians. Almost all of the Australian Test team at the time were signed to WSC – notable exceptions including Gary Cosier , Geoff Dymock , Kim Hughes and Craig Serjeant – and the Australian selectors were forced to pick what was generally considered a third-rate team from players in the Sheffield Shield . Former player Bob Simpson , who had retired 10 years previously after a conflict with the board, was recalled at the age of 41 to captain Australia against India. Jeff Thomson was named deputy in a team that included seven debutants. Australia managed to win the series 3–2, mainly thanks to the batting of Simpson, who scored 539 runs, including two centuries; and the bowling of Wayne Clark , who took 28 wickets. Australia lost the next series—against the West Indies, which was fielding a full team—3–1, and also lost the 1978–79 Ashes series 5–1, the team's worst Ashes result in Australia. Graham Yallop was named as captain for the Ashes, with Kim Hughes taking over for the 1979–80 tour of India. Rodney Hogg still managed to take 41 wickets in his debut series, an Australian record. WSC players returned to the team for the 1979–80 season after a settlement between the ACB and Kerry Packer. Greg Chappell was reinstated as captain.
The underarm bowling incident of 1981 occurred when, in a ODI against New Zealand , Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor to bowl an underarm delivery to New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie , with New Zealand needing a six to tie off the last ball. The aftermath of the incident soured political relations between Australia and New Zealand, with several leading political and cricketing figures calling it "unsportsmanlike" and " not in the spirit of cricket ".
Australia continued its success up until the early 1980s, built around Bob Simpson, the Chappell brothers, Dennis Lillee , Jeff Thomson and Rod Marsh . The 1980s was a period of relative mediocrity after the turmoil caused by the Rebel Tours of South Africa and the subsequent retirement of several key players. The rebel tours were funded by the South African Cricket Board to compete against its national side, which had been banned—along with many other sports, including Olympic athletes—from competing internationally, due to the South African government's racist apartheid policies. Some of Australia's best players were poached: Graham Yallop, Carl Rackemann , Terry Alderman , Rodney Hogg, Kim Hughes, John Dyson , Greg Shipperd , Steve Rixon and Steve Smith amongst others. These players were handed three-year suspensions by the Australian Cricket Board which greatly weakened the player pool for the national sides, as most were either current representative players or on the verge of gaining honours.

Ravichandran Ashwin 3/16 (4 overs)
Chennai won by 58 runs
Umpires: Asad Rauf (Pak) and Simon Taufel (Aus)
Player of the match: Murali Vijay (Chennai)
Chennai Super Kings won the toss and elected to bat.
In the final held at the capacity-filled [17] M. A. Chidambaram Stadium , Chennai , the Chennai Super Kings won the toss and elected to bat on a slow pitch. [18] The openers , Murali Vijay and Michael Hussey opened by scoring a partnership of 159 runs. Murali Vijay proceeded to score 95 runs off of 52 balls including four fours and six sixes , for which he was later awarded the 'Man of the Match'. The Chennai score was also supplemented by 22 runs from the captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni . A quick loss of wickets towards the end provided some consolation for Royal Challengers Bangalore .
Needing 206 runs to win, Royal Challengers Bangalore lost their opening batsman and Orange Cap holder Chris Gayle early to Ravichandran Ashwin . A frequent loss of wickets meant that Royal Challengers Bangalore were unable to build any partner runsships even though Saurabh Tiwary and Virat Kohli contributed 42 and 37 runs respectively and were subsequently able to finish only with 147 in their 20 overs with the last ball which was a six from Saurabh Tiwary thus making Chennai Super Kings The first team to win more than one cup . [19]
Winning captain Dhoni said that playing in the IPL just after the World Cup was tough and added that the fans were also "emotionally drained" after the India's win at the World Cup. [20] Opposing captain Daniel Vettori , who conceded that they were already on the back foot after letting Chennai score 205, said "Would have been a much better game if we could have put up a bowling performance like yesterday, but it was not to be. I think 200-plus was tough for us; 160-170 would have been chaseable." [21]
Chris Gayle won the Orange Cap for maximum runs in the tournament (608 from 12 matches) while Lasith Malinga who plays for the Mumbai Indians got the Purple Cap for most wickets (28 from 16 matches). Kieron Pollard was awarded for taking most catches in the tournament while Kings XI Punjab batsman Paul Valthaty was awarded the Best Individual Performance in the IPL for his 120 runs against Chennai. [22] The Rising Star of IPL was awarded to Iqbal Abdullah of Kolkata Knight Riders .[ citation needed ]

3 centuries, 2 fifties
2011: World Cup, Sri Lanka and India[ edit ]
Following England's quarter-final departure from the 2011 World Cup , Andrew Strauss resigned the ODI captaincy and Cook was named his successor, despite not having featured in an ODI since leading the side in Bangladesh. In addition to Cook's promotion, seam bowler Stuart Broad was named captain of the Twenty20 side and England went into the home series with Sri Lanka with different captains for each format of the game.
In the Test series against Sri Lanka Cook made 133 in the first Test of the series to help England take a 1-0 lead. His good form continues into the next match where he made scores of 96 and 106. In the final match of the series Cook made 55 in his only innings of the match, meaning he had scored two centuries and two half centuries in his four innings. Cook's first game as full-time captain against Sri Lanka at the Oval saw England victorious by 110 runs. [169] England went on to win the series 3–2, with Cook top scoring for England in the series with 298 runs in five matches. This performance also led to an ODI player of the series award.
Cook was expected to be a key player when England met India, with the series winners taking over the world number one spot. Although Cook failed to make a significant score in the first game, England won the match to go 1-0 up. Cook only scored seven runs in the entire match in the next game, although England again won to go 2-0 up. In the third match of the series Cook hit a brilliant 294 to help England win the game by an innings and clinch the World's number one spot. In the final match of the series he made 34 as England won the series 4-0. In the second ODI Cook made an unbeaten 80 to help guide England to victory. After making scores of 23 and 12 in the next two matches, Cook finished off the series in good form, making 50 in the final game as England won by six wickets.
England then travelled to India for a limited overs series overseas. Cook scored 60 in the first match but England lost by 126 runs. He scored just 13 runs in the next three games, which included being dismissed for a duck. In the final match of the series he returned to form, making 60. However, England again lost and suffered a 5-0 series defeat.
2012: Pakistan, Sri Lanka and West Indies[ edit ]
In the winter of 2012, England struggled in Test matches in the sub continent. They were beaten by Pakistan in the first match of the series, with Cook being dismissed for single figures in both innings. He made 94 in the next game, the only time he passed 50 in the tour, but it was not enough to prevent England losing the match and going 2-0 down. Cook was out cheaply in the first innings as England were again bowled out for less than 200, and although he made 49 in the next innings it wasn't enough to prevent another England defeat.
In the first Test against Sri Lanka England's form showed no sign of improving and they lost the first match of the series, with Cook being dismissed for a duck in the first innings. With the pressure on England going into the final match of the two Test series, Cook returned to his best, making 94 in the first innings before hitting an unbeaten 49 to help England level the series at 1-1.
Back at home against the West Indies, Cook continued to perform well, hitting a half century in the first match of the series. England went on to win the match by five wickets. They also won the next match of the series, with Cook performing well and making an unbeaten 43 in England's second innings to help guide them to victory. The final match of the series ended in a draw. After being dismissed for a duck in the first ODI, Cook made a superb 112 in the second to help England win the match by 8 wickets.
2012-13: South Africa and India[ edit ]
England struggled in the three match series against South Africa, eventually losing the series 2-0. Cook started the series well, making yet another century in the first innings of the first match between the two sides. However, he was dismissed for a duck in the second innings as South Africa took a 1-0 lead. The next match ended in a draw, with Cook making decent contributions, despite failing to pass fifty. The third match was over shadowed when Kevin Pietersen was dropped following an argument with senior England players. Cook scored just ten runs in the match as England lost to lose the series 2-0 and lose their spot at the top of the Test rankings. Cook had an unsuccessful ODI series, the only 50 he made coming in the final match of the series. England lost the match and series finished 2-2.
Cook batting during the third Test during the 2013 Ashes in England. England won the series 3–0; it was Cook's first Ashes series as captain.
On 29 August 2012, Cook became England's Test captain after previous Test captain Andrew Strauss retired from all forms of cricket. [170]
Cook, who captained England in Bangladesh for two Tests in a previous series, took charge of England for the Test series against India in the winter of 2012. In each of the first three Tests – the first a defeat and the second a ten-wicket victory – he scored a century. This, together with a century in each of the aforementioned two Tests in Bangladesh, gave Cook five centuries in five Tests as captain, a record number. [171] His scores on the tour also included 119 and 97 in the warm-up matches. The ten-wicket victory in the second Test was lauded by the media as one of England's greatest victories, and Cook's run of hundreds brought him level with the English Test record for most centuries. On 6 December 2012, Cook became England's leading scorer of centuries after making a hundred against India in Kolkata. [171] [172]
On 7 December 2012 he captained England to its first Test series victory on Indian soil since 1984–85, as well as overtaking Mike Gatting as England's highest ever run scorer in India [3]
Cook continued his impressive form in the ODI series, scoring 75 in the first match, which helped England win the game. Cook was less impressive in the next two games as India took a lead in the series after winning both games. Cook made 74 in the fourth game but England still lost and India took an unassailable 3–1 series lead. England won the last game meaning the series had finished 3–2 to India, meaning the tour was seen as a success and the transition from Strauss to Cook was seen as a smooth one.
2013: New Zealand and Champions Trophy[ edit ]
After the tour of India, Cook lead England in New Zealand. In the second ODI, Cook hit 78 to guide England to victory and level the series 1–1. England clinched the series by winning the decider, in which Cook made 46 to secure the series for England. In the first test match, Cook made a century to help England battle to a draw after a poor showing in the first innings. Cook was not at his best in the final two games of the two, although the nature of the wickets meant that the batsmen found it easy to score runs, and so the series ended 0–0. Despite the pitches, many had expected England to win the series and the draw was seen as a disappointment. [173]
Cook lead England in the 2013 Champions trophy, and they won their first game against Australia. It was also Cook's first game as captain against Australia. Cook made 59 against Sri Lanka, but England lost the game meaning they were not assured of their place in the next round. Cook top scored with 64 as England narrowly beat New Zealand to book their place in the semi final. After beating South Africa in the semi finals, England played India in the final in what turned out to be a rain affected match. Despite restricting India to 129 in 20 overs, England lost the match by 5 runs, leaving them as runners up. [174]
In the first test against New Zealand on home soil, Cook got made good starts in both innings but was unable to convert these scores past fifty. Despite this England won the test match. In the second match, Cook returned to form after making 130 and leading England to a 2–0 series win. This meant that England remained undefeated in Test series under Cook, winning two and drawing one. Cook played in the ODI series, despite calls for him to be rested ahead of the Ashes. He made scores of 30, 34 and 0 in the three match series, with England losing the series 2–1.

(January 2015)
The 2013 home Ashes series marked Cook's first Ashes series as captain. England went into the series as strong favourites, with Australia recently having parted company with their coach. England won the first test, with Cook making 50 in England's second innings to help them set Australia a competitive target to win the game. They were bowled out for 296, meaning England won the match by 14 runs. Although Cook only managed 20 runs in the next match, England cruised to victory, winning by 347 runs. The third match ended in a draw, with Cook scoring 62 in the first innings, but being dismissed for a duck in the second. The fourth test saw England win the series after winning the match and taking a 3–0 series lead. The final match ended in a draw, with Cook failing to pass fifty in either of his innings. Despite this, Cook was generally praised for the way he had led the side. In the ODI series, Cook and Flower decided to rest several of England's Test players to ensure they were fit for the series in Australia. Cook himself played no part in the series, being replaced in the side by Michael Carberry.
England and Cook suffered a complete whitewash when they travelled to Australia for the 2013–14 Ashes series. They were humbled in the first test, losing by 381 runs. Cook top-scored in England's second innings with 65 but it wasn't enough as England slumped to defeat. The second match saw a similar humiliation as England lost by 218 runs. England surrendered the urn after losing the third test, giving Australia a 3–0 series lead. Cook made 72 in the first innings but was dismissed for a duck in the second as England lost their third straight match by over 100 runs. The fourth test saw Cook make another 50, but it wasn't enough to prevent another heavy defeat. England lost the final and the series 5–0, with questions being asked of Cook's captaincy. Cook captained England in the ODI series but was unable to make a big contribution as England went 2–0 down in the series. Cook scored 35 in the third match as England finally won their first game of the tour. However, they went on to lose the series 4–1. Upon returning from Australia, Andy Flower resigned but Cook vowed to continue as captain and was later backed by the ECB to help to mould a new England team.
2014: Sri Lanka and India[ edit ]
Cook continued in his role as captain for the home series against Sri Lanka. In the first ODI of the series he made just 11 runs. He followed this up with an unbeaten 30 in the third match and guided England to a ten wicket victory. He was out for just one in the next match as Sri Lanka levelled the series at 2–2. In the deciding match Cook made 56, his first half century of the summer, although it was not enough to prevent England losing the series 3–2. [175] Cook continued to struggle for form in the Test series against Sri Lanka, scoring 17 and 28 as England drew the game. Cook was also criticised for not declaring earlier and not giving his bowlers enough time to win the game. England lost the next match, with Cook again failing to pass fifty in either innings, with his high score in the match being 33 in the second innings. [176]
Alastair Cook Batting for Essex CCC in 2014
Cook went into the Test series against India under pressure following the defeat to Sri Lanka. In the first Test he scored just five runs. However, as the match edged towards a draw, he collected his maiden Test wicket of Ishant Sharma when he was bowling medium pace. Cook's poor form continued in the second Test when he made scores of 10 and 22 as England lost the game to go 1–0 down in the series. On 27 July in the third test against India at The Rose Bowl, Southampton , Cook scored 95 in the first innings which showed that he was getting back in form with confidence before getting out to Ravindra Jadeja . He then went on to score 70 not out in second innings before declaring as England won the match to level the series. Although he only made 17 in the next match, his captaincy was praised as England won the game by an innings to take a 2–1 series lease. Cook made 79 in the final match of the series, which England again won to seal the series 3–1. Following the win, Cook revealed he had considered his position as captain but was convinced by his wife to continue. After the first match of the ODI series was rained off, Cook made 19 in the second ODI as England suffered a defeat. They went 2–0 down in the series after losing the next game, although Cook batted well, making 44. He made just 9 in the next match as India clinched the series 3–0. Following the defeat questions were asked over Cook's role in the ODI team. However, the team bounced back to win the final game of the series in convincing fashion, with Cook making 46.
Cook captained England for the ODI tour of Sri Lanka. However, he did not perform well in the first two matches, making scores of 10 and 22 as England lost both games. England won the third match, with Cook making 34, although he was later banned for the next game due to a slow over rate. In the fifth match he scored 20, as England won to keep the series alive. However, they lost the last two games, with Cook making scores of 1 and 32. The 5-2 series defeat lead to questions over Cook's leadership of the team.
On 19 December 2014, Cook was removed as one-day captain, and replaced by Eoin Morgan . This was primarily due to his poor form in ODI cricket. [177]
2015: West Indies and New Zealand[ edit ]
Cook continued his captaincy of the Test team, having not scored a century since May 2013. In the first Test of the three-Test series, Cook registered scores of only 11 and 13, in an otherwise strong performance from England. The match finished in a draw. Cook took advantage of favourable batting conditions in the following Test, making 76 in an opening partnership of 125 in England's first innings with Trott . It was England's first century opening partnership since March 2013, and Cook's innings took him past Alec Stewart to become England's second-highest run-scorer in Tests. In the second innings, Cook made 59* in a comfortable run chase to win the Test by nine wickets and help England to secure 1–0 lead in the three match series. In the third test in Barbados, Cook scored 105 in England's first innings, his first Test century in almost two years. However he made only 4 in the second innings, as England slumped to 123 all out. West Indies comfortably chased the runs they needed to gain a victory, making the final result for the series 1–1.
The English team then welcomed the Black Caps in May, with the first Test of the two-match series at Lord's. In the first Test, Cook continued his resurgence with his 27th century in Tests, scoring 162 in the second innings as England ultimately made 478 all out. England went on to win the game by 124 runs to go 1–0 up in the series. Cook continued his good form in the second Test. He made 75 in England's first innings as they posted 350 to equal New Zealand's first innings score. New Zealand were able to build up a big lead in their second innings, an although Cook made 56 in the final innings in the match, England lost the match by 199 runs and the series finished tied at 1–1. During the second test, became England's leading run scorer in Test matches, as well as the first England player to score 9,000 runs in Tests and the first to score 1,0See also: History of cricket in India to 1918 , History of cricket in India from 1918–19 to 1945 , History of cricket in India from 1945–46 to 1960 , History of cricket in India from 1960–61 to 1970 , History of cricket in India from 1970–71 to 1985 , History of cricket in India from 1985–86 to 2000 and History of cricket in India from 2000–01

[4] In 1848, the Parsi community in Bombay formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians. After slow beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877. [5] By 1912, the Parsis, Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans every year. [5] In the early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for the England cricket team . Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and KS Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy – two major first-class tournaments in India. In 1911, an Indian team went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team. [6]
India was invited into The Imperial Cricket Council in 1926, and made their debut as a Test playing nation in England in 1932 , led by CK Nayudu , who was considered as the best Indian batsman at the time. [7] The one-off Test match between the two sides was played at Lord's in London . The team was not strong in their batting at this point and went on to lose by 158 runs. [8] In 1933, the first Test series in India was played between India and England with matches in Bombay, Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Madras (now Chennai). England won the series 2-0. [9] The Indian team continued to improve throughout the 1930s and '40s but did not achieve an international victory during this period. In the early 1940s, India didn't play any Test cricket due to the Second World War . The team's first series as an independent country was in late 1947 against Sir Donald Bradman 's Invincibles (a name given to the Australia national cricket team of that time). It was also the first Test series India played which was not against England. Australia won the five-match series 4–0, with Bradman tormenting the Indian bowling in his final Australian summer. [10] India subsequently played their first Test series at home not against England against the West Indies in 1948. West Indies won the 5-Test series 1-0. [11]
India recorded their first Test victory, in their 24th match, against England at Madras (now Chennai) in 1952. [12] Later in the same year, they won their first Test series, which was against Pakistan . [13] They continued their improvement throughout the early 1950s with a series win against New Zealand in 1956. However, they did not win again in the remainder of the decade and lost badly to strong Australian and English sides. The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home. They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961–62, and also won a home series against New Zealand . They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia, and another series against England. In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967–68.

The key to India's bowling in the 1970s were the Indian spin quartet – Bishen Bedi , E.A.S. Prasanna , BS Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan . This period also saw the emergence of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath . Indian pitches have had tendency to support spin and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups. These players were responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of Ajit Wadekar . Gavaskar scored 774 runs in the West Indian series while Dilip Sardesai 's 112 played a big part in their one Test win.

The advent of One Day International cricket in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world. However, India was not considerably strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defence-based approaches to batting. India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup. Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975, India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.
In contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and were particularly strong at home where their combination of stylish batsman and beguiling spinners were seen at their best. India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976 when they chased 403 to win thanks to 112 from Viswanath. This West Indian defeat is considered to be a watershed in the history of their cricket because it led to captain Clive Lloyd dispensing with spin altogether and relying entirely on a four-man pace attack. In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without an individual scoring a century. There were six fifties, the highest being 70 by Mohinder Amarnath . The innings was the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures.
During the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy Mohammed Azharuddin , Dilip Vengsarkar and all-rounder Ravi Shastri . India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and two-time defending champions West Indies in the final, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the Asia Cup and in 1985, won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the Indian subcontinent . India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the subcontinent for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India's best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers. Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark. Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets. The period was also marked by an unstable leadership, with Gavaskar and Kapil exchanging the captaincy several times.
With 619 wickets, Anil Kumble is the world's third highest wicket taker in Tests and India's highest Test and ODI wicket taker . [14]
The addition of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, Javagal Srinath , India's fastest bowler since Amar Singh made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the subcontinent while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the 1996 Cricket World Cup semifinal, the team underwent a year of change as Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid , later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's . Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998. With the captaincy burden removed, Tendulkar was the world's leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs, as India enjoyed a home Test series win over Australia, the best ranked team in the world. After failing to reach the semifinals at the 1999 Cricket World Cup , Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another po1

Sangakkara was named the man of the series in Test series with Pakistan in 2011/12 —his first man of the series award in Test cricket. He made 516 runs in the 3 match series which was won by Pakistan 1–0. [67] On August in 2013, he was named the ODI Cricketer of the Year, wicket keeper-captain of the ICC World XI Test team, and won the ICC People's Choice Award in 2011 ICC Awards . [58] In 2012, he was named one of the Wisden's five Cricketer's of the Year. [59]
Sangakkara struggled when England toured Sri Lanka in 2012. He failed to score a half century during The Two Test match series. But he regained his form in the ODI series against Pakistan where he twice scored in the 90s. In the following Test series Sangakkara continued his form with a 199, the scoreboard originally said he had scored the double century but it turned out to be a mistake. Sri Lanka later won the Test match. He followed this up with 192 in the game, again missing out on the double century. Sri Lanka drew the next two matches meaning Sri Lanka won the series 1–0. The first time they won a Test series since the retirement of Muttiah Muralitharan .
On the Sri Lankan tour of Bangladesh in 2014, Sangakarra hit his highest test score to date with 319 in the first innings of the second test. [68] Making him only the third Sri Lankan player to hit a triple century after Sanath Jayasuria and Mahela Jayawardena . He followed his triple century with a knock of 105 in the 2nd innings as game finished as a draw. He continued his good batting run with another century in the 2nd ODI.
Along with teammate Mahela Jayawardene, he recorded the most partnership runs for the 3rd wicket in Tests, scoring 5890 runs surpassing the 5826 runs of Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar , during the first Test match against Pakistan at Galle International Stadium . The two also hold the record for the highest partnership for any wicket in Test matches, scoring 624 runs for the 3rd wicket against South Africa in July 2006. [69] This still stands as the largest partnership for any wicket in first-class cricket, anywhere. [70]
His impressive form with the bat continued at the 2014 Asia Cup where he amassed a total of 245 runs in five innings. He started the tournament with a 63 against Pakistan before hitting a match winning 103 against India . He then added scores of 77 and 2 against Afghanistan and Bangladesh before being dismissed for a golden duck in the final against Pakistan. Sri Lanka went on to win the game and the tournament. [71]
Sangakkara decided to retire from T20 internationals after playing the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 . Afterwards Jayawardene also followed him into retirement. Sangakkara under performed in the World T20, but in the final match against India, he scored 51 runs not out off just 33 balls making his team win their second ICC trophy since 1996.
Sri Lanka played their first 7-match ODI series at home, against England from 26 November to 16 December 2014. During the series, on 3 December 2014 he completed 13,000 runs in One-day internationals in the third match of the series at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium , Hambantota , and became the fourth player in one-day history to achieve that feat after Sachin Tendulkar , Ricky Ponting , and Sanath Jayasuriya . He also became the second most prolific half-century maker in One-day internationals during this match. He scored 4 consecutive half-centuries followed by a century in this series. On 13 December 2014, he scored his 20th ODI century, became the second Sri Lankan to score 20 ODI centuries, after 28 by Sanath Jayasuriya, and 9th overall to do so. He also took 4 catches as a wicket-keeper in this match, became the player of the match. [72] This match was his last match in his home town, due to his retirement from ODI arena after 2015 Cricket World Cup .
His last One-Day innings in Sri Lanka was played on 13 December 2014 in the last match of England ODI series. He was caught on 33 in his last innings in home soil. [73]

On 4 January 2015, Sangakkara scored his 38th test century by making 203 against New Zealand during the second match of the 2 test match series. [74] With this feat, he is only one short to become the highest double-century maker in test history. He has 11 test double centuries, only one short of 12 double centuries by Don Bradman . [75] He also surpassed 12,000 runs in test cricket, becoming the first Sri Lankan and 5th overall to achieve that mark. [76]
On 14 February 2015, Sangakkara became the second highest run scorer in One-Day International history, by surpassing Australian Ricky Ponting . He achieved this feat during the first match of 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against New Zealand, but Sri Lanka lost the match. [77]
On 26 February 2015 in 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against Bangladesh, Sangakkara scored his 22nd ODI century in his 400th appearance in One-Day Internationals. The 210* second wicket partnership between Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan on that day was broken again on 1 March 2015, in the next group match in World Cup against England, where Sangakkara joined Lahiru Thirimanne with 212* for the second wicket. Sangakkara scored his 23rd century in this match and this 70 ball century was his fastest century overall and the fastest century by a Sri Lankan in World Cups. [78] [79]
During the same world cup, against Australia, when chasing massive 377 score, Sangakkara passed 14,000 ODI runs, becoming the first Sri Lankan and second overall to pass it. [80] He scored 124 runs in the next match against Scotland , becoming first batsman in World Cup history to score 4 consecutive hundreds. [81]
The last ODI innings of Sangakkara was disappointing from him and his teams' point of view, where Sri Lanka lost the quarter-final against South Africa on 18 March 2015. He only scored 45 runs, where it was Sri Lanka's first World Cup defeat in a quarter final after 1999. His team mate Mahela also retired from ODI career with this match. [82]
Retirement[ edit ]
During the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 championship, Sangakkara announced his retirement from the Twenty20 International arena after the championship with his team mate Mahela. Then in December 2014, he announced that he would also retire from ODI cricket after the 2015 Cricket World Cup , again with Mahela. As he said, he retired from T20I cricket on April 2014 and from ODI cricket on 18 March 2015. [83]
On 1 April 2015, Sri Lanka's Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake stated that Sangakkara should reconsider his intention to retire in August 2015. He said that Sangakarra was disillusioned by some of the actions of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in the past, and now that attempts have been made to change personnel and practices, Sangakkara should reconsider his decision. Sangakkara did not give an answer to the statement. [84]
On 27 June 2015, Sangakkara officially announced his retirement from Test cricket as well. He retired from Test cricket after the second Test match against India . [85] [86] He scored 32 runs in the first innings and 18 in the second of his last test match and got out to Ravichandran Ashwin for the fourth consecutive time in the series. The P Sara Oval ground was decorated with numerous banners and posters of Sangakkara with messages such as "Thank You Sanga" and "Class Never Retires". [87] His teammates including Mahela, Thilan Thushara , and Sanath Jayasuriya, Murali came to the ground to farewell Sangakkara. Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation recognized Sangakkara as the "Player of the Century" citing many of Sangakkara's past memories and achievements.
After the conclusion of the second test, a special farewell presentation was held for Sangakkara with the presence of President Maithreepala Sirisena , Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe , former Sri Lankan Test captain Arjuna Ranatunga , former Indian Test captain Sunil Gavaskar , and several cricket celebrities. Several momentous were given for the behalf of his cricket career and Gavaskar invited him to the former cricketer's club. [88] [89] Indian captain Virat Kohli describnd the new fielding standards put in place by new coach Bob Simpson, the team was restructured and gradually rebuilt their cricketing stocks. Some of the rebel players returned to the national side after serving their suspensions, including Trevor Hohns , Carl Rackemann and Terry Alderman. During these lean years, it was the batsmen Border, David Boon , Dean Jones , the young Steve Waugh and the bowling feats of Alderman, Bruce Reid , Craig McDermott , Merv Hughes and to a lesser extent, Geoff Lawson who kept the Australian side afloat.
With the emergence of players such as Ian Healy , Mark Taylor , Geoff Marsh , Mark Waugh , Greg Matthews , Damien Martyn and Matthew Hayden in the late 1980s, Australia was on the way back from the doldrums. Winning the Ashes in 1989 , the Australians got a roll on beating Pakistan , Sri Lanka and then followed it up with another Ashes win on home soil in 1991 . The Australians went on to the West Indies and had their chances but ended up losing the series. However they bounced back and beat the Indians in their next Test series. With the retirement of the champion but defensive, Allan Border, a new era of attacking cricket had begun under the leadership of firstly Mark Taylor and then Steve Waugh .
Australia won the 2015 Cricket World Cup
The 1990s and early 21st century were arguably Australia's most successful period, unbeaten in all Ashes series played bar the famous 2005 series and achieving a hat-trick of World Cups . This success has been attributed to the restructuring of the team and system by Border, successive aggressive captains, and the effectiveness of several key players, most notably Glenn McGrath , Shane Warne , Justin Langer , Matthew Hayden , Steve Waugh , Adam Gilchrist , Michael Hussey and Ricky Ponting . Following the 2006/07 Ashes series which Australia won 5 nill, Australia slipped in the rankings after the retirements of a key players. In the 2013/14 Ashes series Australia again defeated England 5 nill, and climbed back to 3rd on the ICC International Test Rankings. In February & March 2014 Australia beat the number 1 team in the world South Africa 2–1, and were re-ranked number 1 in the world. The Australian team was marred by the death of Phillip Hughes on November 27, 2014. In 2015 Australia won the 2015 Cricket World Cup . As of April 2015 Australia are ranked 2nd in Test Cricket and 1st in ODI Cricket.

Early life[ edit ]
Rohit Sharma was born to Telugu speaking parents on 30 April 1987 in Nagpur. He completed his primary education at Our Lady of Velankani, [Primary Source][ clarification needed ] then enrolled in the Swami Vivekanand. [3] on a scholarship, after his talent was noticed by the school's cricket coach Dinesh Lad at a summer camp. [4] He excelled in the Giles and Harris Shield school cricket tournaments, [4] after which he was selected for the Mumbai Under-20.
He was later chosen for India's Under-17 and Under-19 teams, and made his mark at the 2006 U-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka, finishing 11th on the ranking of top run-makers in the tournament. [5]
Domestic[ edit ]
Rohit Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy in March 2005;, at Gwalior . [6] It was his unbeaten innings of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone at Udaipur in the same tournament, [7] that brought him into the limelight. [8] Performances for the India A sides in Abu Dhabi and Australia followed, leading to him being selected for the 30 member probables list for the Champions Trophy, [8] although he did not make the final squad. This was before he had made his Ranji Trophy debut. [8] He was also selected for the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy .
Sharma at fielding practice.
Sharma made his First-class debut for India A against New Zealand A, at Darwin in July 2006. [9] He made his Ranji Trophy debut for his First-class side Mumbai in the 2006/2007 season. Though he was unable to contribute much in the initial matches, [10] he scored 205 off 267 balls in the match against Gujarat . [10] Mumbai went on to win the tournament with Sharma scoring a half century in the final against Bengal. [11]
In October 2013, upon the retirement of Ajit Agarkar , and owing to a successful captaincy stint in the IPL for Mumbai Indians, where he helped to win the IPL as well as the Champions League T20, Sharma was appointed as the captain of the Mumbai Ranji team for the 2013–14 season.[ citation needed ]
Rohit Sharma was first selected for the limited-overs matches on India's tour to Ireland in 2007 . He made his One Day International debut against Ireland at Belfast , although he did not bat in the match. [12]
Rohit Sharma eventually made his mark on the international stage on 20 September 2007, when he led India to victory by scoring an unbeaten 50 (which came off 40 deliveries) against South Africa in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 . [13] The win reserved India a berth in the semifinals of the tournament. At one stage India were 61–4, but his partnership of 85 runs with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni helped India to post a total of 153/5. [13] He was eventually declared Man of the Match. [13] Sharma then proceeded to score 30 runs off 16 balls in the final against Pakistan . [14]
Rohit Sharma scored his maiden ODI half-century against Pakistan, at Jaipur on 18 November 2007. [15] and was selected as part of India's 16-man squad for the CB series in Australia. [16] Here, he scored 235 runs at an average of 33.57 with 2 fifties, [17] including his score of 66 in the 1st final at Sydney [18] partnering Sachin Tendulkar for most of India's successful run chase.
However, his ODI performances suffered a downturn after this and his middle-order position was taken over by Suresh Raina , and eventually, Virat Kohli took his position as the reserve batsman. [19]
In December 2009, he scored a triple century in the Ranji Trophy [20] and was recalled to the ODI team for the tri-nations tournament in Bangladesh as Tendulkar opted to rest in the series. [21] However, Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina were selected ahead of him in the playing eleven, and he did not play in any of India's five matches.
Rohit Sharma was called into the Indian Test team in February 2010[ citation needed ] as the only reserve batsman. When V. V. S. Laxman failed to recover from an injury, Sharma was set to make his debut, but injured himself playing football in the warm-up on the first morning of the match. It was too late to bring in a replacement batsman, so the reserve wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha had to play as a specialist batsman. Since then Suresh Raina , Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli overtook him and made their Test debuts in the middle order.
He scored his maiden ODI century (114) against Zimbabwe on 28 May 2010. He followed it up with another century inCuttack in 1954–55 and A.C. (Alan) Smith for Warwickshire v Essex at Clacton in 1965; Smith was a most unusual player in that he was primarily a wicket-keeper, but was sometimes selected as a frontline bowler.
Legal specifications of wicket-keeping gloves[ edit ]
Wicket keeping gloves along with the inner gloves
Law 40.2, which deals with the specifications for wicketkeepers' gloves, states that: If,.... the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the fingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. If used, the webbing shall be:
(a) a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing material attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks.
(b) such that the top edge of the webbing-
(i) does not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to the top of the thumb.
(ii) is taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended. [4]
Substitutes[ edit ]
According to Law 2 of the Laws of Cricket, a substitute (taking the place of an ill or injured player) may not keep wicket. [5]
This rule is sometimes suspended, by agreement with the captain of the batting side, although Law 2 does not provide for such agreement to be made. For example, during the England–New Zealand Test Match at Lord's in 1986, England's specialist keeper, Bruce French was injured during England's first innings. England then used 4 keepers in New Zealand's first innings: Bill Athey kept for the first two overs; 45-year-old veteran Bob Taylor was pulled out of the sponsor's tent to keep, immaculately, for overs 3 to 76; Bobby Parks , the Hampshire keeper, was called up for overs 77 to 140; and Bruce French kept wicket for the final ball of the innings. [6] The same two teams were involved in a wicketkeeper switch in 2015 when BJ Watling was injured, and his gloves was given to Tom Latham for the entire 2nd innings. In the second Test, however, both were relieved of their wicketkeeping duties, allowing Luke Ronchi to make his Test debut, having played many matches for both Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand also used 4 wicketkeepers for the 2nd Test, even when Brendon McCullum has given up wicket-keeping completely since 2013.
Occasional wicket-keepers are players that usually play in other roles but sometimes keep wicket. Rahul Dravid , John Wisden was described as an occasional wicket-keeper. [7] Other players who have been described as occasional wicket-keepers include Ambati Rayudu , [8] Lokesh Rahul , [9] Johnson Charles , [10] Peter Handscomb ., [11] Tillakaratne Dilshan , Lendl Simmons , Eoin Morgan , Phillip Hughes , and Everton Weekes .
Playing without a wicket-keeper[ edit ]
There is no rule stating a team must play a wicket-keeper. [12] On 5 June 2015 during a T20 Blast game between the Worcestershire Rapids and the Northamptonshire Steelbacks , Worcestershire chose not to play a wicket-keeper in the 16th over of the match. [13] Their keeper, Ben Cox , became an extra fielder at fly slip while spinner Moeen Ali bowled. [13] The umpires consulted with each other and agreed that there was nothing in the rules to prevent it from happening. [14]

Ankle surgery rules Ishant Sharma out of IPL

Ishant Sharma could be out of action for at least six months © AFP
Fast bowler Ishant Sharma has been ruled out of the IPL after undergoing an ankle surgery earlier this month, which is likely to keep him out of action for at least six months. Deccan Chargers, Ishant's IPL franchise, confirmed the development, saying they would now be seeking permission from the IPL for a replacement player.
Ishant had been delaying the surgery for nearly a year, but finally decided to take the plunge after he returned from Australia in January, where he had played the Test-leg of the tour. Though he impressed in patches, Ishant remained inconsistent and only managed five wickets at an average of 90.20 in the four-Test series.
It is understood that he had considered delaying the surgery post this IPL season, but that would have ruled him out of the home series against England, starting in November. Ishant is likely to plan his rehabilitation so that he can make a return during the home series against New Zealand, also later in the year.
"The wound is likely to heal in three months' time and he is solely focussing on that," a source close to Ishant told ESPNcricinfo.
Last year, Ishant's India team-mate Virender Sehwag was in a similar scenario with a shoulder injury but he chose to delay his surgery. After the World Cup, he played through pain at the start of the IPL but withdrew midway through the tournament. He was ruled out of the West Indies tour and missed the start of the Test series in England.

Vihari played for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the sixth edition of the Indian Premier League in 2013. In one of the league matches against Royal Challengers Bangalore in Hyderabad, Vihari opened the bowling attack as an off-spinner and removed Chris Gayle for just 1. He also scored an unbeaten 46 in the same match while chasing. Sunrisers ultimately won this match through a super-over .
Vihari was responsible for one-third of Hyderabad's total in the innings against Andhra in 2013/14 Ranji Trophy opener at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium . He scored 75 in the first innings before being dismissed by Stephen then scored unbeaten 68 runs.

Ishant Sharma wants to use the IPL to make an ODI comeback © Associated Press
After having been ignored from the Indian limited-overs' side in recent times, Ishant Sharma is looking forward to making an impact in the IPL to launch his comeback. "Cricket is my passion and the hunger to be part of the best possible action is natural," Ishant was quoted in the website of Deccan Chargers, who he will represent in the IPL this year. "There comes a time in every sportsperson's life when one has to prove to oneself. I am probably going through that phase and would like to challenge myself in the upcoming IPL to win back my place in the Indian side."
Though he has been a regular member of the Test team, Ishant has not played an ODI since August 2009 and has proved to be expensive in the format, losing out to the likes 8] Former West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh identified two problems with Sharma's bowling action : his head drops when the ball is delivered and the position of his wrist varies. The first takes some of the speed out of the delivery, while the second reduces the chance of the ball seaming and swinging . The former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar suggested that the lack of movement in Sharma's bowling discouraged him from pitching the ball up so instead he tends to bowl short . The slower pace of his bowling when he pitches the ball up may explain why the yorker is not an effective delivery for him. Manjrekar went further, saying that "for all his talent and commitment he just does not take enough wickets"; when the remark was made in January 2012, Sharma had a bowling average of nearly 37 from 43 Tests.

Style[ edit ]
Lee was known for his pace and regularly clocked 90 mph and above. He ranks only behind Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar (161.3 km/h, 100.2 mph) as the fastest bowler in contemporary cricket during most of the 2000s. [5] The strain of consistently bowling at 150 km/h caused a string of stress fractures and recurring injuries and forced him to alter his strategy, which he has done effectively. [6] Rather than relying on pace alone, he uses a wide array of deliveries aimed at wearing down the batsman, although he has been known to bowl entire overs above the 150 km/h mark. His fastest ball was clocked at 161.1 km/h (100.1 mph) against New Zealand in 2005. In a match against West Indies in 2000/01 he was clocked at 161.8 km/h (100.5 mph), but it was not an official match and therefore not recognised by the ICC .
Early in his career, Lee was reported for a suspected illegal bowling action, but was cleared, [7] and was also heavily criticised after bowling a series of beamers at batsmen during a number of ODIs in 2005. Captain Ricky Ponting defended Lee saying that it was not intentional. [8] [9] His slower balls also has dramatic falls of pace with varying length, often from a cutter grip, where it can go as slow as 100 km/h (60 mph), but it hovers on average around the 115 km/h-130 km/h range. He is also known to celebrate many bowled wickets with a chainsaw celebration. [10]
Batting[ edit ]
Lee was a competent lower-order batsman. Together with Mike Hussey , he has held the record for highest 7th wicket partnership for Australia in ODIs since 2005–06 with 123. [11]
During the 2005 Ashes series, Lee had numerous defiant innings, including a stand of 43 not out in the Second Test at Edgbaston , Australia's highest individual score in that innings. This innings nearly won the match for Australia but the other batsman Michael Kasprowicz was caught behind by Geraint Jones and England won by just two runs. After the memorable match, England bowlers Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff went over to console Lee. The image of Flintoff consoling Lee was a moment which came to symbolise a hotly contested series. [12]
On 2 April 2006, Lee hit his highest Test score of 64 in 68 balls against South Africa at Johannesburg . His previous highest score in Tests was 62 not out which he made against the West Indies in 2000 at the Gabba . Lee nearly surpassed this score on 3 January 2008 against India when he made 59 off 121 balls. Lee had also once again nearly surpassed his highest test score when he had made 63 not out, but unfortunately Ricky Ponting had declared the innings in the 2nd test against the West Indies. As a result of this, he fell one run short of his highest test score.
Lee's highest score in ODI matches is 59 against West Indies at West Indies in March 2012.
Early career[ edit ]
Lee started playing in the junior teams of his local side, Oak Flats Rats, and gradually worked his way up the ranks. At 16 he began playing first grade cricket for Campbelltown , where he managed to claim the wickets of a few New South Wales cricketers, and Mosman , [13] where at one point, he shared the new ball with Shoaib Akhtar and briefly played alongside England batsman Andrew Strauss . [14] [15]
Lee was called up to the Australian Under 17 & 19 teams. In March 1994, he was forced out of the Australian under-19 team to tour India due to stress fractures in his lower back and it forced him to remodel his bowling action to minimise the impact on his back. He was awarded a scholarship to attend the AIS Australian Cricket Academy in the 1995–96 season. [16] His contemporaries included fellow internationals Jason Gillespie and Mike Hussey . [17]
Prior to making his first-class debut, Lee played for Mosman in the final of the 1996–97 Sydney Grade Cricket competition. [18]
Domestic career[ edit ]
Lee was first named in the New South Wales Blues squad as the twelfth man for the 14–16 November match against Queensland in the 1997–98 Sheffield Shield . [19] The following week, he made his first-class debut for the Blues against Western Australia and took 3 wickets at 114, including that of the captain Tom Moody . [20] It would be his only appearance in the Sheffield Shield for the rest of the season. [21] He ended a memorable month by taking a 5-wicket haul in the Sydney grade Limited-Overs Cup final against Bankstown on 30 November. [22]
During the 1998–99 season Lee was a more regular presence in the latter stages of the Sheffield Shield. He took 14 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul against Tasmania in the second innings. [23] He started the 1999–2000 season by claiming 8 wickets in his first two matches. Such performances impressed his New South Wales teammate Steve Waugh , who was then Australia captain, and culminated in his Test debut in December 1999. He finished the season as the Blues' second-highest wicket taker in the Pura Cup with 24 wickets in 5 matches. [24] [25]
After a successful Test series against India, Lee returned to domestic cricket and was named in the 2008 Pura Cup final . [26] He hit his career best batting score, 97 against Victoria in the Blues' second innings and scored a record 176-run partnership with Beau Casson . [27] [28] In Victoria's second innings, he took 4–72, dismissing the last four tailenders , as the Blues won the final.
In 2009 he battled back from injury and was a key player in New South Wales' success during the Champions League Twenty20 . During the final he played an important part with both bat and ball and was named Man of the Match. [29] [30] He also won the Man of the Series award. [31]
Following his retirement from Test cricket, Lee stopped playing first-class cricket to concentrate on the limited-overs formats. He was the Blues' highest wicket-taker in the 2010–11 Ryobi One-Day Cup with 15 wickets and had the second best economy rate of the top five wicket-takers despite missing the latter stages of the campaign due to international duty.
In June 2012 he declined to renew his contract with the Blues, ending his 15-year association with his domestic team. [32]
He retired from Big Bash League after playing the final match for the Sydney Sixers on 28 January 2015. [33] In his last over, he took two wickets of successive deliveries, however, his hat-trick ball did not result in a run out in what was to be the final ball of the match, which Sydney Sixers lost by a run. [34]
International career[ edit ]
One month after making his first class debut, Lee was chosen to represent the Australian A team on a tour to South Africa. He claimed two wickets but in that very match, stress fractures in his back from the previous injury had re-opened and Lee was in a back brace for over three months.
Test career[ edit ]
By the late 1990s there were calls for Lee to be included in the national squad. Captain Steve Waugh , who also played with him for New South Wales , was impressed by Lee's debut and pushed for his inclusion into the national team. He was eventually chosen in the final 14 for the Test series against Pakistan in 1999 but failed to make the starting 11. By the time the Test series against India came around, he was twelfth man . However, he duly made his Test debut for Australia in December 1999 against the touring Indians , becoming Australia's 383rd Test cricketer.
Bowling first change, Lee took a wicket in his first over in Test cricket when he bowled Sadagoppan Ramesh with his fourth delivery. He also captured Rahul Dravid in his first spell before returning to take three wickets in six balls to finish the innings with figures of 5/47 from 17 overs, becoming the first Australian fast bowler since Dennis Lillee to take 5 wickets on debut. [35] [36] Lee took thirteen wickets in his opening two Tests at the low average of 14.15.
Lee won the inaugural Donald Bradman Young Player of the Year Award at the Allan Border Medal award ceremony in 2000 soon after his debut.
Lee took 42 wickets in his opening three series, the most by any Australian bowler in the seven matches he played. [37] He was selected for the Test series against the West Indies in late 2000. During the first Test he scored his first half- century in test cricket and in the next Test, took seven wickets including a five wicket haul in the second innings. [38] However, he suffered a stress fracture of the lower back which kept him out of the next three Tests. He returned against Zimbabwe but soon suffered another setback a month later when he broke his right elbow and was sidelined until May 2001.[ citation needed ]
Return from injury[ edit ]
Lee returned to the international team for the 2001 Ashes series after recovering from an elbow injury. His comeback saw less success than his debut, managing only nine wickets in five Tests at 55.11. However, Lee was back as Australia's leading wicket-taker in the first and third Test against New Zealand later that year, in a series which he captured 5 wickets in the second innings and made a contribution of 61 with the bat in the first Test match. The series ended in a 0–0 draw. He finished the series with 14 wickets at 25.14. The two home and away series against South Africa were not as productive, yielding 19 wickets in six Tests at 38.42.
Lee only took five wickets in a match on three occasions between the New Zealand series and the 2003 Cricket World Cup . Lee came under pressure for his position after taking only five wickets at 46.50 in the three-Test series against Pakistan in 2002. Andy Bichel , who was filling for the injured Jason Gillespie , took eight wickets at 13.25. With the other frontline bowlers all taking wickets at less than 13, [39] Lee was dropped when Gillespie returned for the first two Tests during the 2002–03 Ashes series. He returned for the Perth Test, after claiming a five wicket haul in a Pura Cup match against Queensland for New South Wales . He took thirteen wickets at 41.23 in three matches, compared to Bichel's ten at 35.1. [40] After the 2003 Cricket World Cup , Lee took 17 wickets at 28.88 in four Tests against the West Indies. It was the first series in two years where he averaged under 30, and only the second in that period where had averaged under 40.
After a mid year break, he participated in a Two Test series against Bangladesh in northern Australia. He took six wickets at 31.66, and was Australia's most expensive bowler, with the other specialist bowlers averaging 15.55 against the lowest ranked team in Test cricket. He followed this with six wickets at 37 in a comfortable 2–0 Test series against Zimbabwe, in which the other specialist bowlers averaged 23.15. [41]
Against the Indian batting line-up in the 2003–04 home series, which ended in a 1–1 draw for Australia, Lee was out of the first two Tests recovering from a torn abdominal muscle, an injury which he sustained during the Zimbabwe series. [42]
Loss of Test position[ edit ]
Lee took eight wickets in 100 overs in the final two Tests against India, at an average of 59.50. This Test included a double century to Sachin Tendulkar in the Indians' first innings of 7/705 where Sachin and V.V.S. Laxman freely attacked Lee and other bowlers in the final Test in Sydney. He ended the series with the worst average and economy rate of Australia's front line bowlers. [43]
He was subsequently replaced by fellow fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz in 2004 during the tour of Sri Lanka when Lee's ankle injury worsened, forcing him to return home to have surgery. This injury would force Lee out of the game for 4½ months to ensure his full recovery. Lee's form in the Test arena had been ineffective, and from July 2001 to January 2004, he had a Test bowling average of 38.42, [44] compared to an average of 16.07 in his earlier career.
Lee was unable to reclaim his position for eighteen months, when Kasprowicz took 47 wickets at 23.74 in thirteen Tests, taking his wickets at a much lower cost than Lee had done in the previous three years. This included 17 wickets at 26.82 on the spin friendly pitches of the Indian subcontinent, helping Australia to its first whitewash in Sri Lanka, and its first series win in India for 35 years. [45]
Test return[ edit ]

After 18 months on the sidelines, Lee returned to the Test team in the 2005 Ashes series. With Kasprowicz and Jason Gillespie both struggling for form, Lee returned to take the new ball with Glenn McGrath . He averaged 40 with the ball for the series, which some commentators have put down to having to bowl longer spells than he was accustomed to at the time[ citation needed ], but was retained, in part because of his defiant batting[ citation needed ] which yielded runs at an average of 26.33. During the Ashes, he claimed his 150th test wicket off Andrew Strauss with a straight yorker on Day 1 of the third test.
Part of Lee's difficulty at Test level is that the benefits of his high speed, which give the batsmen less reaction time, also results in more erratic bowling. In recent times he has tried to concentrate solely on accuracy by reducing speed. During the first Test against the West Indies in late 2005 at the Gabba , after declaring that he would sacrifice pace and focus on 'line and length', [46] Lee reverted to his initial style of bowling, based on the advice of his captain Ricky Ponting after his new method of bowling failed in the first innings. [47] This saw him take 5/30 his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests, his first in four years.
In the 2005-06 Australian cricket season , Lee's Test figures improved from his 2001–04 difficulties, with a season bowling average of 25.74.
During South Africa's 2005–06 tour of Australia, Lee's form saw a steady improvement, with figures of 5/93 in the first Test at Perth . He finished the three Test series with 13 wickets and of the Australian bowlers, was second only to Shane Warne 's 14 wickets in the series. Three Australian players including Lee, who was reprimanded in the Third Test in Sydney for showing dissent towards umpire Aleem Dar . [48]
With the unavailability of Glenn McGrath for the tour of South Africa in March–April 2006, Lee became the spearhead of the Australian bowling line-up. [49] In the second Test of that series, at Durban , Lee captured his 200th Test wicket in his 51st match and also captured figures of 5 for 69, on the back of 49 Test wickets in 2005. [50] He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year . He was unable to maintain his performance when Australia visited Bangladesh for a two Test series, taking two wickets at 93, coming bottom of Australia's bowling averages. [51]
In the first three tests of the 2006–07 Ashes series , he only took eight wickets and was fined for excessive appealing in the Third Test in Adelaide when a LBW decision was not in his favour. [48] However, during the week period between the Adelaide and Melbourne tests, he worked with Troy Cooley , Australia's bowling coach, to adjust his run up and came back in the 4th and final tests with more wickets. He finished the series 20 wickets, with his best bowling figures being 4 for 47 at an average of 33.20, including 6 in the final test. His tally was only bettered by his teammates Stuart Clark , Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath as the quartet claimed more wickets than the entire England bowling attack combined. [52]
Post McGrath-Warne era[ edit ]
Following the retirements of Warne and McGrath, Lee rose to the challenge and was awarded the Man of the Series in the inaugural Warne-Muralidaran Trophy , a two-Test series against Sri Lanka in late-2007. In his first series as bowling spearhead reaped 16 wickets at an average of 17.5. This was achieved by bowling 5 km/h slower to improve accuracy. In the following series Lee took 24 wickets at 22.58 in four Tests against India. In this series he overtook Jason Gillespie to become Australia's 5th highest wicket taker. His consistent efforts saw him rewarded with the Man of the Series Award for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , 2007–08. He capped off the season by winning the Allan Border Medal , the award given to the player adjudged Australia's best international cricketer of the past year.
Lee seemed underdone in the 2008 Australian tour of the West Indies, taking only 5 wickets in the first Test match, during which he seemed exhausted. He returned to productivity, taking eight wickets in the Second test, including a 5 wicket haul, and 6 in the Third Test.
During the Indian tour, Lee picked up a stomach virus and was unable to find his best form throughout the series. Lee showed glimpses of his best form[ citation needed ] when the team returned to Australia for a two test series with New Zealand, but generally seemed down on pace. However, he struggled in the two tests he played of the series with South Africa, which Australia lost 2–1, likely due to a niggling ankle injury and then a stress fracture he developed during the series (both in his left foot). The fracture broke completely during the second innings of the Boxing Day Test-match and he was forced to return home for surgery.
By the time he returned to the Australian team for the Ashes in 2009, his position as spearhead had been usurped by the left armer Mitchell Johnson . Additionally, the arrival of bowlers like Peter Siddle , Ben Hilfenhaus and Doug Bollinger ensured that Lee had to fight for a position in the team. However, he took six wickets in the first innings against the England Lions team in a practice match leading up to the Ashes. Lee was the only bowler to get reverse swing in this match and appeared to be in line for selection for the First Test at Cardiff. However, he picked up a left side strain and a sore rib in this match and he was ruled out of the first three Tests. He was then overlooked for a recall and never played test cricket again, announcing his retirement from test cricket at the beginning of 2010.
Retirement[ edit ]
Lee had been considering retiring from Test cricket for some time since 2008 due to the physical strain. In February 2010, he announced his retirement from Test cricket after consulting friend and England rival Andrew Flintoff , stating that bowling "at 150km/h for five days is very hard on the body". [12] [53] He had been out with a string of injuries and had not played a Test since December 2008. He ended his Test career with 310 wickets in 76 tests, the fourth highest Australian total behind Shane Warne , Glenn McGrath and Dennis Lillee .
One-day International career[ edit ]
Lee bowling against Pakistan at Lord's , 2004-09-04
Lee made his One Day International debut for Australia against Pakistan on 9 January 2000 during the Carlton and United Breweries Series at the Gabba , Brisbane . He became the 140th ODI cricketer to represent Australia. In February 2002 against South Africa , he scored his first ODI half century , 51* not out.
In One-day Internationals, he was ranked by the ICC as the No. 1 ODI bowler in January 2006 [54] and has been ranked among the top ten ODI bowlers since the start of 2003. His bowling strike rate of around 30 puts him amongst the most incisive in this form of the game. He also has a One-day International hat-trick to his name, achieved in the 2003 World Cup against Kenya . Lee was the first Australian and fourth bowler to ever achieve this feat in World Cup history.
In the matches Australia played in the 2005–06 triangular one day series , Lee gave a display of his useful batting abilities by making 57 in the second game in a 100 run partnership with Michael Hussey to pull Australia out of a middle order collapse. Lee finished the series with 15 wickets, the third highest tally behind Nathan Bracken and Muttiah Muralitharan .
His bowler-fielder partnership with long-time international teammate and wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist yielded 58 wickets in 151 matches, the fourth highest of all time in ODI history. [55]
2003 World Cup[ edit ]
With main bowler Shane Warne banned from the 2003 World Cup the day before the opening match, Lee moved up the pecking order and, together with Andy Bichel and Glenn McGrath , formed one of the tournament's most lethal attacks, claiming 59 wickets between them. Lee concluded the tournament with 22 wickets off 83.1 overs at an average of 17.90, a wicket behind Sri Lankan left-arm fastbowler Chaminda Vaas . Lee also had a third leading strike-rate of 22.68 behind West Indian fast bowler Vasbert Drakes and Australian counterpart Andrew Bichel who topped the strike-rates with 19.43 and 21.37 respectively. He also reached the 160 km/h mark twice; his delivery to Marvan Atapattu in the semi-final of the reached 160.1 km/h (99.5 mph) [56] and hit 160.7 km/h in his first over against England in the group stage. [57]
Lee earned six of his 22 wickets during the group stage, 11 wickets during the Super-six stage, 3 from the semi-final and 2 wickets from the final which Australia won. He took one five-wicket haul, 5 for 42, against Trans- Tasman rivals New Zealand during their super-six encounter at Port Elizabeth to put Australia ahead after a dismal innings. [58] He also earned his first international hat trick with figures of 3 for 14 against Kenya during the last match of the super-six stage. [59]
Comeback[ edit ]
After having to return home due to injury during the 2007 World Cup , Lee traveled with the squad to England for the 2009 "English summer" tour . He was left out of the test side during the Ashes but was in the one-day side for the NatWest Series in September. He was the highest wicket-taker for Australia with 12 and also took his ninth five-wicket haul in ODIs as Australia made a clean sweep winning all except one match in the series. [60] With that five-wicket haul, he became the first person to take two five-wicket hauls in ODIs at Lord's ; the ball used is now on display at Lord's MCC Museum. [61] Later that month he was a part of the successful 2009 ICC Champions Trophy squad and was level on 6 wickets with teammates Peter Siddle and Shane Watson , the highest total for the Australian team. Injuries sustained in test matches forced him out until 2011, having not played for Australia for almost two years. In the subsequent ODI series, his return was more successful. He finished as the leading wicket-taker for the series with 11 scalps at 24.00, his series best figures of 3/27 coming in the third match at the SCG . His pace was consistently around the mid 140s km/h and on occasion he once again managed to break the 150 km/h mark.[ citation needed ].
Despite competition from younger bowlers and another injury setback, Lee managed to make the squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup . He finished the tournament with 13 wickets, the highest of all the bowlers in the team. Of the 13 wickets, 4 came in the match against Pakistan but it was not enough as Australia lost the match and eventually crashed out at the quarterfinals to rivals India .
Against the West Indies in March 2012 he hit his highest score, 59 before getting caught off a ball by Kemar Roach . His final ODIs were during the 2012 tour of England and Ireland . During the match against Ireland he opened the bowling and bowled William Porterfield and Ed Joyce in only his first three deliveries. [25] [62] [63]
Retirement[ edit ]
Upon his retirement form international cricket, Lee had played in 76 Tests, 221 ODIs and 25 T20Is, and had equalled Glenn McGrath's run of 380 wickets in ODI matches – the highest for Australia. [2] [3] [64] [65]
In July 2014, he played for the  the next match of the tri-series against Sri Lanka on 30 May 2010 by scoring 101 not out. [22] [23]
He was dropped from the Indian squad for 2011 World Cup . [24]
He was selected for the West Indies tour of 2011 after the IPL in a squad where senior batsmen such as Sachin Tendulkar , Virender Sehwag and skipper MS Dhoni were rested, and Yuvraj Singh , Gautam Gambhir were out to injuries. [25] The side was captained by Suresh Raina with Harbhajan Singh as his deputy. He contributed 26 off 23 balls with two sixes in the only T20I at Queen's Park Oval and strung a 71-run partnership with Subramaniam Badrinath leading to an Indian victory.[ citation needed ]
In the ODI series that followed, he carried on with his good form. The first ODI was also played at Queen's Park Oval . Rohit was elected man of the match for his 68 not out of 75 balls with three fours and a six. [26] In the third ODI played at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium , Antigua ; Sharma scored a matching-winning 86 of 91 balls. Rohit along with Harbhajan Singh got India out of trouble to win the match after they were reduced to 92 for 6. [27] He was widely appraised for his calm and matured performance. Sharma won his first Man of the Series award for excellent batting performance throughout the ODI series. [28] His good form continued as he bagged another Man of the series award against West Indies again but this time on Indian soil. [29] He was part of the squad selected to play in the Australian series .
In 2013, he was experimented as new opening batsman for India along with the Shikhar Dhawan for the Champions Trophy . [30] The successful starts achieved by this opening pair helped India win the Champions Trophy and Tri-nation series in the West Indies . His good form continued in the home series against Australia when he scored an 141 not out in Jaipur and 209 runs off 158 balls, in Bangalore and with 16 sixes, he broke the world record for most sixes hit in an ODI innings.
Sharma during the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia.
In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell Test series, Sharma made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in Kolkata against the West Indies. He scored a 177 which was the second best score on debut by an Indian behind Shikhar Dhawan. Sharma became one of the few Indian players who scored a century on Test debut. He followed it up with a 111 not out at his home ground at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai becoming the third Indian cricketer to score back-to-back centuries in the first two tests—a feat which was achieved by Sourav Ganguly in 1996 in England and Mohammad Azharuddin in 1984 who scored centuries in his first three tests.
In 2014, he became the first person to score more than 250 runs in One-Day international cricket. He scored 264 against Sri Lanka at the Eden Gardens , Kolkata . With this innings, he became the first player to score two double hundred in ODIs. His innings of 264 is the highest score by a batsman in an ODI, surpassing 219 by Virender Sehwag . [31] [32] [33]
On 2 October 2015, in South Africa's tour of India , Sharma scored 106 in the first T20I at HPCA Stadium , Dharamsala . With this feat, he became the second Indian cricketer to have scored centuries in all formats of the game. On 11 October, in the first ODI of the tour, he scored 150 off 133 balls, in a losing cause while chasing South Africa's total of 303. [34]
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
Rohit Sharma is one of the most successful players in IPL and has the unique record of finishing the match by scoring a last-ball six. He has one IPL century and a hatrick to his name. Sharma was signed up by the Deccan Chargers franchise for a sum of US$750,000 a year in 2008. [35] He was one of the leading run scorers in the 2008 IPL season with 404 runs at an average of 36.72. [36] He also held the coveted Orange Cap for a brief period.
In the 2009 IPL season he was appointed as the vice-captain of the Deccan Chargers . In a match against Kolkata Knight Riders where 21 was required off the last over, Sharma scored 26 off the over from Mashrafe Mortaza to seal a win. He was the fifth bowler to take an IPL hat-trick [37] and was awarded the best U-23 player of the tournament.
In the 2011 IPL auction, he was sold for US$ 2million to the Mumbai Indians. [38] He was later promoted as the permanent captain of the Mumbai Indians in the 2013 season as Ricky Ponting was benched due to poor form. Mumbai Indians under his captaincy won the IPL for the first time. It was a terrific season for him as a captain as he helped Mumbai Indians to win the IPL as well as the Champions League T20 in 2013.
Once again in 2015 he helped MI to win the IPL 8 title by beating Chennai with margin of 41 runs in final played on 24 May 2015. He played an unbeatable innings of 50 of 26 balls for the team to score a 202/5 and also won the Man of The Match award in the finals. He became only one of the captains who won the IPL trophy twice. He also became the second player after Yusuf Pathan to be a part of the playing XI that won the IPL title three times: once with the Deccan Chargers and twice as the skipper of the Mumbai Indians.

Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji Jadeja was an Indian who played for the English cricket team
The British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721. [4] In 1848, the Parsi community in Bombay formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians. After slow beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877. [5] By 1912, the Parsis, Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans every year. [5] In the early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for the England cricket team . Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and KS Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy – two major first-class tournaments in India. In 1911, an Indian team went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team. [6]
India was invited into The Imperial Cricket Council in 1926, and made their debut as a Test playing nation in England in 1932 , led by CK Nayudu , who was considered as the best Indian batsman at the time. [7] The one-off Test match between the two sides was played at Lord's in London . The team was not strong in their batting at this point and went on to lose by 158 runs. [8] In 1933, the first Test series in India was played between India and England with matches in Bombay, Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Madras (now Chennai). England won the series 2-0. [9] The Indian team continued to improve throughout the 1930s and '40s but did not achieve an international victory during this period. In the early 1940s, India didn't play any Test cricket due to the Second World War . The team's first series as an independent country was in late 1947 against Sir Donald Bradman 's Invincibles (a name given to the Australia national cricket team of that time). It was also the first Test series India played which was not against England. Australia won the five-match series 4–0, with Bradman tormenting the Indian bowling in his final Australian summer. [10] India subsequently played their first Test series at home not against England against the West Indies in 1948. West Indies won the 5-Test series 1-0. [11]
India recorded their first Test victory, in their 24th match, against England at Madras (now Chennai) in 1952. [12] Later in the same year, they won their first Test series, which was against Pakistan . [13] They continued their improvement throughout the early 1950s with a series win against New Zealand in 1956. However, they did not win again in the remainder of the decade and lost badly to strong Australian and English sides. The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home. They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961–62, and also won a home series against New Zealand . They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia, and another series against England. In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967–68.

The key to India's bowling in the 1970s were the Indian spin quartet – Bishen Bedi , E.A.S. Prasanna , BS Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan . This period also saw the emergence of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath . Indian pitches have had tendency to support spin and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups. These players were responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of Ajit Wadekar . Gavaskar scored 774 runs in the West Indian series while Dilip Sardesai 's 112 played a big part in their one Test win.

The advent of One Day International cricket in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world. However, India was not considerably strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defence-based approaches to batting. India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup. Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975, India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.
In contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and were particularly strong at home where their combination of stylish batsman and beguiling spinners were seen at their best. India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976 when they chased 403 to win thanks to 112 from Viswanath. This West Indian defeat is considered to be a watershed in the history of their cricket because it led to captain Clive Lloyd dispensing with spin altogether and relying entirely on a four-man pace attack. In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without an individual scoring a century. There were six fifties, the highest being 70 by Mohinder Amarnath . The innings was the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures.
During the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy Mohammed Azharuddin , Dilip Vengsarkar and all-rounder Ravi Shastri . India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and two-time defending champions West Indies in the final, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the Asia Cup and in 1985, won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the Indian subcontinent . India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the subcontinent for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India's best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers. Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark. Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets. The period was also marked by an unstable leadership, with Gavaskar and Kapil exchanging the captaincy several times.
With 619 wickets, Anil Kumble is the world's third highest wicket taker in Tests and India's highest Test and ODI wicket taker . [14]
The addition of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, Javagal Srinath , India's fastest bowler since Amar Singh made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the subcontinent while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the 1996 Cricket World Cup semifinal, the team underwent a year of change as Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid , later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's . Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998. With the captaincy burden removed, Tendulkar was the world's leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs, as India enjoyed a home Test series win over Australia, the best ranked team in the world. After failing to reach the semifinals at the 1999 Cricket World Cup , Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3–0 on a tour of Australia and then 2–0 at home to South Africa. Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again. ed Sangakkara as "a lovely person". [90] President Sirisena offered him to work as the Commissioner for the United Kingdom in Sri Lanka stating "He has been a great face for our country and it gives me immense pleasure in offering him the post of High Commissioner to the UK". [91]
Cowdrey Lecture[ edit ]
Sangakkara delivered the 2011 MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lords . [92] He became the youngest person and the first current international player to deliver that lecture, which was widely praised by the cricketing community. [13] [14] [93] The one-hour-long speech was based on the history and the corruption in the cricket administration in Sri Lanka. In his speech, he said: "accountability and transparency in administration and credibility of conduct were lost in a mad power struggle that would leave Sri Lankan cricket with no clear, consistent administration", and observed that these problems in administration had risen only after Sri Lanka's 1996 Cricket World Cup victory. [94] He also blamed "a handful of well-meaning individuals" who control the game, wasting the cricket board 's finances and resources. Immediately after the lecture, the Sri Lankan sports minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage ordered an investigation into the speech. [95] Despite the critical comments by the Sri Lankan government officials, it has been described as "the most important speech in cricket history". [96]
Beyond cricket[ edit ]
After his retirement from ODI cricket in 2015, Sangakkara became the Leading Wisden Cricketer of the year 2014 for his impressive cricket career. With this award, he was second only to Indian Virender Sehwag , to win the Wisden Leading cricketer award twice, both in 2011 and 2015. He also won the award for Outstanding Contribution to Sport at the 5th Asian Awards, which were held in London on 17 April 2015. [97]
On 19 August 2015, just after the end of Sri Lankan Parliamentary election of 2015 , president Maithripala Sirisena appointed Sangakkara as the Ambassador Of Anti-narcotics program In Sri Lanka. [98] The letter of appointment was handed over to Sangakkara by the president at President’s official residence. [99] [100] [101]
Domestic cricket[ edit ]
Sangakkara currently plays domestic cricket for Nondescripts in Sri Lanka, as well as Surrey in England and also various T20 tournaments around the world.
County cricket[ edit ]
Sangakkara has played English county cricket with Warwickshire in the 2007 County Championship . In 2010 Sangakkara was contracted to represent Lancashire in the 2010 County Championship , [102] but never represented the club because of international commitments. [103] For the 2015 and 2016 seasons Sangakkara has contracted to play for Surrey . [104]
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
Sangakkara has played in five seasons of the Indian Premier League . Winning bids for him in 2008 and 2011 were US$700,000 by Kings XI Punjab and US$300,000 by Deccan Chargers respectively. He was the captain of the Sunrisers Hyderabad team. Sangakkara has scored 1567 runs with 10 half-centuries in 62 matches in IPL. [105]
Sri Lanka Premier League[ edit ]
In the Sri Lanka Premier League which officially started in 2012, Sangakkara was named the captain and icon player of the Kandurata Warriors franchise. Unfortunately he couldn't participate as a player in the inaugural edition in 2012 as he suffered a finger injury weeks before the tournament during a One Day International against India. However, he appeared as a television commentator during some matches.
Caribbean Premier League[ edit ]
On 18 August 2013, Sangakkarra joined the Jamaica Tallawahs of the Caribbean Premier League . [106]
Return to county cricket[ edit ]
Before Sri Lanka's test series against England in 2014, Sangakkara returned to county cricket, playing two matches for Durham , [107] which included 159 against Sussex in his final innings. On 16 January 2015, it was announced that he would be joining Surrey on a two-year contract. [108] Sangakkara scored a brilliant century against Glamorgan , where he scored 149 runs, which was his maiden century for Surrey in this county season. After the match, he said that he is willing to see the comeback of English batsman Kevin Pietersen to the international cricket [109] [110]
Personal life[ edit ]
Sangakkara is married to his longtime partner, Yehali. [111] They have twins, a girl and a boy: Swyree and Kavith. [112]
He is involved in a number of charity work in Sri Lanka. He is a member of the Think Wise Initiative, launched by International Cricket Council , Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and UNICEF , which is aimed at raising awareness of HIV prevention and eliminating discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS . [113] He is also a partner of the Foundation of Goodness, a charity launched by Muttiah Muralitharan . [25]
Playing style[ edit ]
Sangakkara is a left-handed top order batsman who likes to hit the ball square of the wicket on the off-side. While the cut and the pull are natural strokes to him, he tends to play off the front foot. The cover drive is one of his regular scoring shots. Sangakkara averages 58.66 in Test cricket. In ODI cricket, he retired with an average of 42. [114] Sangakkara handed over his wicket-keeping duty to Prasanna Jayawardene in Tests cricket in 2006. He played as a specialist batsman in Tests, and retired as a wicket keeper-batsman in other formats of the game. He is the first in the list of wicket keepers who contributed to the most number of dismissals in ODI cricket, With 499. He is also the wicket keeper with highest number of stumpings—99—in ODI cricket. [115]
He has won a certain degree of admiration for his clever use of sledging and is one of few cricketers who are willing to talk about it openly. In an interview in 2004 he explained his approach to sledging:
The public perception of sledging is to go out there and abuse someone in obscene language, questioning their parentage or sexual preferences. That kind of abuse does not belong on the field of play. Sledging, as coined and pioneered by the Australians, is a measured comment designed to get a reaction out of a player. It could be any reaction: a bit of anger, a show of arrogance, a comment, a shake of the head, or a slump of the shoulders.
— Kumara Sangakkara in 2004 [116]



Personal life[ edit ]
Laxman was born in Hyderabad , Andhra Pradesh (now Telangana ). [9] [10] Laxman's parents are, noted Physicians Dr. Shantaram and Dr. Satyabhama of Vijayawda-Guntur. [11] Laxman studied at Little Flower High School , Hyderabad . He then enrolled as a medical student but chose cricket as a career over medicine. He was awarded an honorary doctorate degree on 4 February 2015 by Teri University , New Delhi . [12] [13]
He married G. R. Shailaja from Guntur , who is a post-graduate in computer applications on 16 February 2004. [11] They have two children – a son, Sarvajit and a daughter, Achinthya.
Laxman is related to India's second President Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan . [9]
Philanthrophy[ edit ]
Recently he attended Food for Change along with Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Pulela Gopichand for the charity event of educating 2 lakh students.
Playing style[ edit ]
Laxman is known for his "wristy, willowy and sinuous" style, one which is technically fluid at its best. Laxman's on-side playing capability is comparable with his fellow Hyderabadi Mohammed Azharuddin 's. The Australians once admitted that they did not know where to bowl to him. [14] Laxman is widely criticised as a slow runner between the wickets and he is one of the few players who have played 100 Tests but have never played in the Cricket World Cup . Despite being a slow runner between wickets, Laxman could score rapidly as he was such a fine stroke player and could play freely for long periods of time.
VVS Laxman with his family at Teri University , receiving the doctoral degree.
Technically sound, Laxman stands tall and still at the crease, with a keen awareness of the off-stump and a polished ability to dispatch the bad ball. He plays with a high elbow and a steady stance and a textbook technique with natural elegance and flair. At the start of his career, Laxman was rated by Geoffrey Boycott as one of India's best current players of the hard (new) ball. Indian selectors also thought on those lines and asked Laxman to open on a number of occasions. But Laxman came into his own only when he was asked to bat in the middle order. Laxman has played some of his best match-winning innings while playing at no. 3, no. 5 and no. 6. His score of 281 against Australia rang in a new era of Indian dominance which culminated in India gaining the no. 1 spot in test cricket a few years later. His 281 is rated by many as the best ever innings played by an Indian batsman. He made that score while batting at number 3, having been moved up the order from no. 6 for the second innings of the test match.
Youth career[ edit ]
Laxman made his Under-19 debut for India against Australia in February 1994. [15] Batting at six, he made 88 in his debut innings against a bowling attack that consisted of Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie , both of who were making their debuts too. [16] In the second game of the series, Laxman scored an unbeaten 151 in the first innings and 77 in the second innings to help his team register a 226-run victory. [17] He continued his good form as he scored 36 and 84 in the third game to end up as the leading run-scorer of the series. [18] The Test series was followed by a 3-match ODI series, where he managed scores of 24, 22 and 77. [19] [20] [21] Later in August that year, the India Under-19 team toured England for 2 ODIs and 3 Test matches. [22] Laxman disappointed in the ODIs with scores of 20 and 5. [23] [24] However, in the first Test he struck 119 in the first innings, but did not get to bat in the second innings as India cruised to a 9-wicket win. [25] He made only 28 in the second match and 4 in the third. [26] [27]
Domestic cricket[ edit ]
Laxman made his first-class debut for Hyderabad against Punjab in the quarter-final match of 1992–93 Ranji Trophy season. He scored a duck in the first innings and 17 in the second. [28] He played only one match for Hyderabad in the next season, before getting dropped. [29] However, he was named in the South Zone squad for the 1994/95 Duleep Trophy in the back of his impressive outings for India Under-19s, but he failed to score big in the tournament. In the following Ranji Trophy season, Laxman notched up 532 runs from five matches at an average of 76 scoring two centuries. [30] In the semi-final of the Duleep Trophy of 1995/96 season against West Zone , Laxman scored 47 in the first innings and a spectacular 121 in the second innings, sharing a 199-run partnership with skipper Rahul Dravid . [31] He had another brilliant Ranji season the next year, as he piled 775 runs in just 11 innings at an average of 86 with 3 centuries [32] and a best of 203* that came against Karnataka in the semi-final, which Hyderabad eventually lost. [33] He was picked to play for Rest of India against Karnataka in Irani Cup and also in the Board President's XI squad against the touring Australian team. [34] He played only three matches in 1996/97 Ranji season, where he scored three half-centuries, [35] before getting picked for the Indian Test team against South Africa . [36]
Early international career (1996–2000)[ edit ]
Laxman made his Test debut in 1996 against South Africa at Ahmedabad , scoring a fifty in the second innings of the match. [37] In the second game at Kolkata , he scored 14 and 1. [38] He played just one Test in the South African tour the following month and was unable to cement his place in a star-studded Indian middle order. Instead, he was asked to open the innings, starting in West Indies in 1997. At Kingston , he scored 64 in his first innings as opener. [39] However, he averaged only 28 in that series playing as an opener. [40] But intermittently continued in this role for nearly three years, but without any consistent success. In 1998 at Calcutta , he scored 95 against Australia opening the innings with Navjot Sidhu who scored 97. [41] India went on to win the match by an innings and 219 runs. Though he was selected in the Test squad that toured New Zealand in 1998, he did not get to play a single game as Ajay Jadeja was preferred over Laxman to open the innings with Sidhu. [42] Laxman scored a duck on his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in the Pepsi Tri-Series in 1998. [43] He had a horrible run in the ODIs in 1998 which resulted in him getting dropped from the ODI team for more than a year. Against Pakistan in 1999, he scored just 66 runs from two Tests, averaging a modest 16. [44] In the first match of the Asian Test Championship later that year, Laxman scored 67 against Pakistan, but failed to score consistently, before getting dropped from the Test team as well. [45]
Laxman returned to playing first-class cricket in 1999 to regain his place in the national team. In the 1999–2000 season of Ranji Trophy, he broke the record for most runs in a Ranji season when he made 1415 runs, at an average of 108, in just 9 matches notching up eight hundreds – a record that still remains intact. His performance was rewarded when, in January 2000, he was recalled in the Indian squad for the Australian tour. He scored 167 in the third and final Test match at Sydney when the rest of the batsmen struggled to cope with Glenn McGrath 's destructive bowling, [46] a rare high point for India in an otherwise disastrous tour. Despite this success against an attack containing both McGrath and Shane Warne , Laxman apparently decided that he would return to domestic cricket, rather than continue playing as opener, a role which he believed did not suit him. As a result, Laxman was out of the Test team for nearly a year. He was recalled in late 2000, and also found a spot in the side for the home series against Australia in 2001.
Australia's tour of India (2001)[ edit ]
Laxman's career changed dramatically in the home series against Australia . In the first Test at Mumbai , Laxman made 20 and 12, as the entire Indian batting line-up, with the exception of Sachin Tendulkar , capitulated, leading to a 10-wicket defeat. [47] This was Australia's 16th consecutive Test win and extended their own world record. [48] In the next Test, however, after scoring 59 in the first innings, Laxman shot to fame with an extraordinary knock of 281 in the second innings (following on) against Australia at the Eden Gardens , when under tremendous pressure and with Australia looking set for a crushing 17th win in a row. [49] He broke Sunil Gavaskar 's long standing Indian Test record score of 236*. [50] This remained the highest ever by an Indian until it was eclipsed by Virender Sehwag 's triple ton against Pakistan in Multan in March 2004. [51] The innings also contributed to a record partnership of 376 with Rahul Dravid who made 180 and together they survived the whole 4th day. Laxman's performance was of enormous consequence: India had been on the brink of an innings defeat but went on to win the Test and the series, denying Steve Waugh 's conquest of the "final frontier". This was only the third time in the history of cricket that a team had managed to win a Test after being forced to follow on. [52] It has become one of the most celebrated tales of Indian cricket, and the innings is ranked the sixth best Test innings ever by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. [53] At the time, the pitch was taking significant turn, and to negate Laxman's free scoring, Australian leg spinner Shane Warne pitched his deliveries into the footmarks outside leg stump. However, such was Laxman's play that he consistently drove the ball through long on for boundaries against the spin, something that is considered to be technically dangerous. When Warne attempted to stop Laxman from scoring by defensively stationing most of the fielders on the leg side ( leg theory ) and bowling outside leg stump, Laxman proceeded to skip down the pitch and drive Warne inside-out through the vacant off side, hitting through the line of a substantially turning ball. Warne later admitted that he was clueless as to how to stop Laxman. Laxman went on to score 65 and 66 in the third and the final Test match at Chennai , which India won by 2 wickets and won the series 2–1. [54] Laxman had great amount of success batting at No.3 in the ODI series that followed the Tests, as he scored 45, 51, 83, 11 and 101 in the five games, thus cementing his spot in the ODI line-up as well. [55] In the Coca-Cola Tri-Series later that year in Sri Lanka, Laxman scored 212 runs in 7 matches with two fifties and a decent average of 36. [56]
West Indies and Australia tours (2002–2004)[ edit ]
Laxman then cemented his place both in the Test and one day teams for a few years. After bad performances in the Test series against Zimbabwe , he did well in the first two ODIs scoring 75 and 52, but couldn't convert the starts into big knocks in the next three matches. Laxman managed to score a fighting 89 in the second Test at Port Elizabeth , when the rest of the team struggled to survive against Shaun Pollock 's deadly bowling, helping his team put up 201 on the board and avoid an embarrassing follow-on. Against the touring England in late 2001, he scored 75, sharing a 100-plus run partnership with Tendulkar to take his team out of trouble. He had a great tour of West Indies , as he scored 474 runs in 8 innings at an average of 79. He had scores of 69, 69*, 74, 1, 43, 130, 65* and 23 in that series. He performed reasonably well during West Indies tour of India as well, particularly in the third match at Kolkata , where he scored 48 and 154*. He followed it up with brilliant showing in the 7-match ODI series as well with scores of 47, 99, 66 and 71 in the first five games. But his form dropped during India's tour of New Zealand in 2002/03. In the first Test at Wellington , he got a pair and in the second match he could score only 23 and 4. However, he had a brilliant 2-match Test series against the same team in India as he scored a half-century along with 44 in the first Test and 104* and 67* in the second match. He won the Man of the Series award for his impressive batting performances in the two Test match series. In October 2003, he scored 102 in the first ODI against Australia at Gwalior , sharing a 190-run second wicket partnership with Tendulkar. However he failed to deliver on a consistent basis in ODIs. He continued to perform well against Australia, especially during India's tour of Australia in 2003–04, in which he hit three ODI and two Test centuries. He was involved in two century partnerships, one with Tendulkar and the other with Dravid, in the Brisbane ODI against Australia where he remained unbeaten on 102. His 106* against the same opponents at Sydney saw him put up a fourth-wicket partnership of 213 runs with Yuvraj Singh , who scored his career-best 139. In the next ODI against Zimbabwe, Laxman scored a 138-ball 131, once again setting up 2 hundred-run stands. He scored 148 in the famous Adelaide Test, sharing a triple century partnership with Rahul Dravid , which India won by 4 wickets. This was their first Test victory in Australia in two decades. His innings of 178 at Sydney also came in a triple century partnership, on this occasion with Sachin Tendulkar . India went on to post 705/7 in their first innings which is their highest total in Test cricket. Laxman scored a total of 494 runs from the 4 Tests at a staggering average of 82. During this series, Ian Chappell described Laxman as Very Very Special Laxman. His 107 (104) against Pakistan in the fifth and the final ODI at Lahore , helped India win by 40 runs and clinch the series 3–2.
Decline of form (2004–2005)[ edit ]
However, Laxman's form was on the decline since the series against Australia. Beginning with the series in Pakistan in 2004, Laxman had only[ clarification needed ] Test centuries to his credit, with one coming against a weak Zimbabwe side. He averaged just 31 in the Test series in Pakistan in 3 matches. His only half-century (71) came in a high-scoring game at Rawalpindi where India made a mammoth 600 to win the game by an innings and 131 runs. He struggled to score in the ODI series in England which put question marks over his future in the shorter format. He struggled against his favourite opponents Australia in the home series in October–November 2004, although his 69 in the low-scoring final Test at Mumbai was instrumental for India to record a consolation victory. He had a mixed Test series against Pakistan in 2005. He scored 58 in the first Test, 0 and 24 in the second and 79* and 5 in the third. He batted well in the Sri Lanka Test series scoring a fifty at Delhi and a crucial century (104) in the last match at Ahmedabad . Laxman was dropped after scoring a duck in the first Test against England at Nagpur in March 2006. He regained his place for the tour of the West Indies in place of the injured Tendulkar, and made a hundred in the third Test. He also scored a resilient 63 in the second innings to deny West Indies the victory in the same match. In ODIs, Laxman was left out persistently since Greg Chappell took over as coach in mid-2005, mainly on account of his slow ground fielding and running between the wickets; Laxman is a highly regarded close-catching fielder in stationary positions but in ODIs, these positions are generally disused except for the opening phases of the match, and players otherwise have to patrol substantial spaces and retrieve balls. Another reason was a perception that his batting is too one paced for ODI cricket and that he lacks the ability to score at a high rate as required when the batting team has the momentum, or in the closing stages of the innings. This was despite his superb form in Australia and Pakistan in early 2004, when he made four centuries in 14 games, including three in a week in the VB Series in Australia.
Return to form[ edit ]
VVS Laxman
In December 2005, Laxman helped India to victory against Sri Lanka with a fine century. In June 2006, Laxman again rescued India from a difficult position against the West Indies with a gritty century. In November 2006, he was selected in the test squad for India's tour of South Africa. In the first test in Johannesburg Laxman scored 73 in the second innings to help India claim a historic 123 run win. In the 2007 tour of England Laxman produced three good innings, two of which were half-centuries and a vital 39 that helped India draw the first test at Lords. He passed the 5000 run landmark in the first day of the final test.
After the tests he joined Lancashire as their overseas player in place of Brad Hodge . He played in five games of the county championship and showed glimpses of his sublime batting. In their final County Championship game of 2007, against Surrey at the Oval, Laxman scored a century in the second innings which Lancashire were chasing 489 to win. They just missed out by 25 runs and subsequently lost the Championship to Sussex. His performance for Lancashire was good with 380 runs scored in 5 matches at an average of 54.28 with 2 centuries and 2 half-centuries [57]
In India's home series against Pakistan in 2007, V.V.S. Laxman once again showed his importance to the team with a disciplined batting performance in the 1st Test at Delhi , as he scored 72* in dire circumstances. [58] He then followed that innings of 72 in the first test with 112 in the second test. [59] This ensured his place on the tour of Australia which would be his third to that country.
Sublime form from end of 2007 till May 2011[ edit ]
Laxman's good form continued in the 2007/08 Test series against Australia with him scoring 109 against Australia on the second day of the controversial Sydney Test to put India back into the contest. It was his 12th hundred in Test matches, and his 5th against Australia. It was also his third consecutive century at SCG , giving him an average well above 90 at the venue. He followed this up with a gritty knock of 79 in Perth , assisted by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and RP Singh , which set India up to record a historic and unexpected victory at a ground on which previously no Asian team had won. He hit 51 in the first innings of the final Test at Adelaide. He finished as the second highest run-getter for India in that series, only behind Sachin Tendulkar .
He, like all other Ind00 Test runs against five different nations.
2015 Ashes[ edit ]
Cook captained England in the 2015 Ashes series, and although England won the first game, Cook could only manage scores of 20 in the first innings and 12 in the second. England lost the second Test by 405 runs, but Cook was one of the few England batsman to show any resistance, scoring 96 in England's first innings. With the series level Cook made 34 in England's first innings of the third Test and England went on to win the game by eight wickets. England won the fourth Test by an innings and 78 runs, meaning Cook only needed to bat once, scoring 43 in England's first innings. With the Ashes won, Cook was praised for his captaincy and he gave an emotional interview following the victory. England lost the final match of the series, but Cook was again one of few England batsmen to show any resistance with the bat as he scored 85 in their second innings. Despite the loss, England won the series 3–2 and Cook celebrated his second Ashes win as captain.
2015 Test series vs Pakistan[ edit ]
Cook scored his third double century and 28th test ton (263) against Pakistan in first test at Abu Dhabi in October 2015 in 836 minutes - longest innings by an Englishman and 3rd longest of all time, facing 528 balls. In doing so he also became the all time highest non-Asian run scorer in Asia overtaking Jacques Kallis' 2,039 runs.

History[ edit ]
In 1899, a combined school cricket team, composed mainly of cricketers from Royal College , S. Thomas' College and Wesley College beat Colts Cricket Club by a one run. A decision was made to form an all-Sinhalese club, and thus Sinhalese Sports Club was founded. The club leased a land in Victoria Park with sandy soil and covered with cinnamon trees. [5]
In 1952 the club leased another 20 acres (81,000 m2) and moved to its present location in Maitland Place, which was used as an aerodrome by the allied forces in World War II . [2]
Ground[ edit ]
The pavilion of the ground was built in 1956 with the sponsorship of Donovan Andree, a leading nightclub entrepreneur. [5] A giant scoreboard and sightscreens were built in the mid-70s. Later the current scoreboard was built. The ground also has a media center and commentary box with modern facilities. Various sponsors including Lankabell, Seylan Bank and HSBC have built stands bearing their brands. There are two grass embankments for the spectators.
Highlights[ edit ]

In 2015, he has switched from UP to Gujarat in domestic circuit and currently representing Gujarat in Ranji Trophy.
In his third one-day match, Singh got his first man of the match award as he played his part as India restricted Sri Lanka to a modest 196 all out. Swinging the ball on a batting wicket, he took 4 important wickets to rattle Sri Lanka. His bowling figures of 8.5 overs, 2 maidens, 35 runs and 4 wickets announced his arrival on the international stage. Singh was selected to make his Test debut in the 2nd Test against Pakistan in Faisalabad , Pakistan in January 2006. He won the man of the match award on his debut after taking 5 wickets in the match.

India went on to win the series 4–1. In his first 11 ODI matches, he was awarded the man of the match award 3 times.
Singh was favoured to Sreesanth for the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy due to his superior economy rate. However, he was unable to maintain his level of performance, and was dropped from the side.
In 2006 it was announced that Singh would be signing for English side Leicestershire as their second overseas signing. He was however unexpectedly recalled to the Indian side following their poor World Cup campaign and only made a handful of appearances.

Guardian, The (7 August 2011). "India's Zaheer Khan ruled out of England series with ankle injury" . The Guardian Newspaper (London: The GuarGanguly was appointed the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman Ajay Jadeja were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as "the Indian cricket's worst hour". However, the new core – Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly – swore not to let this happen to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times. And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era. [15]
Since 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements with the appointment of John Wright as India's first ever foreign coach . India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001. The series was famous for the Kolkata Test match, in which India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. Australian captain Steve Waugh labelled India as the "Final Frontier" as a result of his side's inability to win a Test series in India. [16] Victory in 2001 against the Australians marked the beginning of a dream run for India under their captain Ganguly, winning Test matches in Zimbabwe , Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. The England series is also known for India's highest ODI run-chase of 325 runs at Lord's which came in the Natwest ODI Series final against England. In the same year, India were joint-winners of the ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka, and then went to the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa where they reached the final only to be beaten by Australia . The 2003–04 season also saw India play out a Test series in Australia where they drew 1–1 with the world champions, and then win a Test and ODI series in Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team in action in the Wankhede Stadium
At the end of the 2004 season, India suffered from lack of form and fitness from its older players. A defeat in a following home Test series against Australia was followed by an ODI home series defeat against Pakistan followed by a Test series levelled 1–1. Greg Chappell took over from John Wright as the coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and his methods proved to be controversial during the beginning of his tenure. The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly, resulting in Rahul Dravid being made captain. This triggered a revival in the team's fortunes, following the emergence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina , and the coming of age of players like Irfan Pathan and Yuvraj Singh . A thumping home series victory over Sri Lanka in 2005 and a drawn series with South Africa put India at second place in the ICC ODI rankings. Dravid, Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were selected to play for the ICC World XI in the 2005 " SuperTest " against Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second. [17] Towards the middle of 2006, however, a 4–1 series loss in the West Indies gave rise to a slump in India's ODI form, while they achieved a 1–0 victory in the Test series that followed, giving them their first Test series victory in the Caribbean since 1971. India's ODI form slumped further with a disappointing performance in the 2006 Champions Trophy and a drubbing in the ODI series in South Africa. This was followed yet again by an initial good performance in the Tests, giving India its first Test match win in South Africa, although they went on to lose the series 2–1. This Test series was marked by Ganguly's comeback to the Indian team. [18]
In December 2006, India played and won its first ever Twenty20 international in South Africa, becoming the most recent Test team to play Twenty20 cricket. The beginning of 2007 had seen a revival in the Indian team's ODI fortunes before the 2007 Cricket World Cup . Series victories against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, marked by the comeback of Ganguly, and strong form by Tendulkar, and the emergence of young players like Robin Uthappa saw many pundits to tip India as a real contender to win the 2007 Cricket World Cup . However, defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw India fail to reach the second round. After winning the Test series against England in August 2007, Dravid stepped down as the captain of the team following which Dhoni was made the captain of the Twenty20 and ODI team. In September 2007, India won the first-ever Twenty20 World Cup held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by 5 runs in the final. In 2007–08, they toured Australia where India lost the controversial Test series 2–1, but managed to win the CB series the following month with a whitewash final of Australia. [19]
In April 2009, India secured their first Test series win in New Zealand in 41 years. After beating Sri Lanka 2–0 in December 2009, India became the No. 1 Test team in the world. They retained the ranking by drawing series against South Africa and Sri Lanka. In October 2010, India whitewashed Australia 2–0 in the home Test series, giving them back-to-back series wins against them. Later that year, India managed to draw the Test series in South Africa at 1–1. [20]

Youth and early career[ edit ]
Morgan was born in Dublin and educated at the Catholic University School on Leeson Street, where he won three senior cup titles for the school. In his early teens Morgan played hurling twice a week and this helped develop his skills as a batsman, particularly as the grip for hurling is the same as for the reverse sweep. [4] During this time he also briefly attended Dulwich College to further his cricketing education and it was here that his ambition to play for England began. [4] Morgan represented Ireland's youth teams and was capped at Under-15 and Under-17 level. He was selected in the Irish Under-19 squad for the 2004 Under-19 World Cup , and was Ireland's top run-scorer in the competition. [5] Two years later, he captained Ireland in the 2006 Under-19 World Cup where he finished as the second-highest overall run-scorer. [6] He also plays for Finchley CC.
Domestic career[ edit ]
Morgan scored his maiden first-class century for Middlesex on 5 July 2008 at Uxbridge. This was compiled from 250 balls. He achieved this against the touring South Africans before their Test series against England; the innings included three sixes off spinner Paul Harris .

Ireland career[ edit ]
Morgan made his One Day International debut for Ireland on 5 August 2006 at the European Championships against Scotland . He fell one run short of a century, scoring 99 before he was run out . It was the first time in ODI history that a player had been dismissed for 99 on debut. Only two other batsmen passed 20 as Ireland beat Scotland by 85 runs. [11] His maiden ODI hundred came not long after, on 4 February 2007 against Canada in Nairobi. He became the third youngest ever non- subcontinental player to make a century in ODI cricket. [12]

England[ edit ]
On the Fringes[ edit ]
Morgan told the Sunday Times that ‘From the age of 13, I wanted to play cricket for England. I’ve never felt any shame in saying this is what I wanted to do. And the people at home involved in cricket, they were like, “Fair play, it’s going to be unbelievable if you make it”. So I’ve never had any shame about this and my father’s never had any shame about it.’ [15] England is one of the ten full members of the International Cricket Council , while Ireland is an associate member. Only full member nations can play a full schedule of international cricket, including Test matches.
In May 2007, Morgan was named as one of England's twelfth men for the Lord's Test versus West Indies, [16] and came on for Matthew Hoggard on the third day. [17] On 16 August 2008, Morgan represented the England Lions in a list A match against the touring South Africans . He scored 47* in an unbeaten partnership of 113 with Samit Patel in the course of England Lions securing a six wicket victory. [18] Morgan was part of the England Performance Programme squad in India in the winter of 2008, [19] although no matches were played as the tour was cancelled after the November 2008 Mumbai attacks . [20] Morgan was also part of the England Lions for the winter tour of New Zealand. [21]
After touring with the England Lions over the winter, it was announced in April 2009 that Morgan was in England's 30-man provisional squad for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 . [22] This meant that he could not play for Ireland, who are also participating in the tournament. While disappointed to be denied Morgan's batting, team manager Roy Torrens said "[Morgan's] made no secret of that fact [wanting to play Test cricket]. So you know, it's not totally unexpected to us. We realise this is always going to be a problem with our better players playing in England". [23]
2009 West Indies, Australia and South Africa[ edit ]
Morgan's progression towards representing the senior England side continued when in May 2009 he was named in England's 14-man squad to face West Indies in a three-match ODI series and the 15-man squad for the World Twenty20. [24] [25] Morgan made his England debut in the second One Day International (after the first was abandoned due to rain), and also played in the third of the series. Morgan was not given much of a chance to impress with the bat, due to not coming in to bat until late in the innings, making scores of 2 and 6 not out, but was praised for his athletic fielding.
Morgan played in the opening match of the World Twenty20 against the Netherlands, but after England's defeat played no further part in the tournament. [26] [27]
At the end of the English Summer, Morgan was involved in the ODI against Australia . Although they had just lost the Ashes to England in the Test series, Australia won the first five games with Morgan one of few batsmen to emerge with any credit, including a first one-day half century for England in the fifth match, winning praise with his innovative style.
In the first game of the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy , Morgan led England to an unexpected victory over much fancied Sri Lanka . He hit an unbeaten 62, and was well supported by Middlesex colleague Owais Shah . Morgan kept wicket for the first time in his professional career in the next match against South Africa, after regular wicket-keeper Matt Prior was struck down by illness. [28] Morgan scored 67 runs from just 34 balls in England's innings. [29]

He kept his place for the next match, where he scored 28 to help England win the match by seven wickets.
2010 Bangladesh, World T20 and Australia[ edit ]
He played well in the ODI series in Bangladesh. After making 33 in the first match of the series, he hit a magnificent unbeaten 100 to help England win the second ODI by two wickets. His innings earns him the man of the match award. He made 36 in the final match of the series, meaning he had scored 169 runs in the three matches he had played. Morgan was one of England's stand out batsmen in the series and his performances earns him praise from the media.
He was an important part of England's Twenty20 team that won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies. He top-scored in England's group games against the West Indies and his native Ireland, [30] [31] as well as the Super Eights game against New Zealand . [32] Due to effective team bowling and half-centuries from Kevin Pietersen and Craig Kieswetter , he was hardly needed in the semi-final against Sri Lanka and final against Australia , finishing not-out in both matches. [33] [34]
England then hosted Australia in a five-match ODI series . In the first game, Morgan scored an unbeaten 103 off 85 balls at the Rose Bowl [35] and followed it up with a half-century in the second, with England winning both matches. England won the series with two games to spare, although they lost both dead rubbers, and Morgan was named Player of the Series.
2010 Bangladesh and Pakistan[ edit ]
On the back of his one-day success, he was then included in England's Test squad for the home series against Bangladesh . With Paul Collingwood rested, he made his début in the first Test at Lord's on 27 May 2010. [36] He scored 44 runs in the first innings but was not required in the second innings as England won by eight wickets after making Bangladesh follow-on . [37] In the second Test, he scored 37 runs as England won by an innings and 80 runs. [38]

In the final match of the series he scored 107 not out to help England win by 121 runs.
2011 Australia and World Cup[ edit ]
Morgan did not perform well during the ODI series with Australia. His top score of the series came in the third match between the two sides, where he made 30. He made 24 in the next match to help England win by 21 runs. In the fifth ODI he made just two as Australia won the match by 51 runs. The sixth match of the series saw Morgan make 21 from just 13 balls, but it was not enough to prevent another an England defeat, this time by two wickets.
Morgan was not initially named in England's squad for the 2011 World Cup as he was suffering from a fractured finger, [39] but was later called up following an injury to Kevin Pietersen . [40] On 11 March 2011 he made his World Cup debut for England, scoring 63 runs in the defeat to Bangladesh , [41] making him only the fourth player to have represented two different nations at the Cricket World Cup.

Play media

The retirement of Paul Collingwood from Test cricket opened up a place in England's batting order. Morgan and Ravi Bopara were the leading contenders for the position; while Bopara stayed in England to play county cricket, Morgan chose to play in the IPL for six weeks. [43] In nine innings for Kolkata Knight Riders Morgan scored 137 runs with a highest score of 66. [44] His first first-class innings of the English season was in a match for the England Lions against the touring Sri Lankans alongside batsmen competing to the vacant place in England's batting line up. [45] He scored 193 and according to the national selector it was enough to secure his selection for the squad to face Sri Lanka in first Test against Sri Lanka in May . [46]
England won the three-match series 1–0, with Morgan scoring 168 runs from four innings including two half-centuries. [47] Stuart Broad replaced Collingwood as T20I captain in June, and Morgan was named as vice-captain in the format. [48] England also won the five-match ODI series 3–2, [49] with Morgan scoring 158 runs including another two half-centuries. [50] His performance in the series saw Morgan move up one place in the ICC's ODI rankings to 23rd. [51]
Morgan retained his place when India toured England later that summer for four Tests. In the first three innings Morgan managed just19 runs, including two ducks [52] [53] however in the second innings of the second Test Morgan partnered Matt Prior as the two scored rapid half-centuries against a struggling Indian bowling attack. [54] England won the match by 319 runs. [53] An injury to Jonathan Trott meant that Ravi Bopara, with whom Morgan had been competing for a place earlier that summer, was called into the side. [55] Whereas Bopara scored just seven runs in the third Test, Morgan scored his second Test century as England amassed 710/7 declared. [56] England won the Test series 4–0 and in the process replaced India as the number 1 ranked Test team in the world. [57] [58] Morgan's 194 runs in the series came at an average of 32.33. [59]
After the series win against India, Cook was rested for England's one-off ODI against Ireland and Morgan handed the captaincy for the fixture, [60] becoming only the third Irish man to lead England. [nb 2] An innings of 59 from Morgan shepherded his inexperienced team, which featured three debutantes, to victory and secured him the Man-of-the-Match award. [62] During a T20I against India in late August, Morgan's shoulder became acutely painful. He underwent surgery and missed the home and away ODI series against India. [63] Mitigating this disappointment, in September Morgan was awarded a central contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) until September 2012 for the first time. [64]
2012 Pakistan and West Indies[ edit ]
Morgan recovered from his shoulder injury to participate in England's series against Pakistan in the UAE from January to February 2012. England lost the Test series 3–0, and their batsmen struggled to cope against Pakistan's spin bowlers. Morgan made scores of 24 and 14 in the first Test. It was in the second Test where he came under increased pressure, scoring just 3 runs in the entire match after being dismissed for a duck in the second innings. His top score of the series came in his final innings of the tour, where he made 31. [65] Morgan, Pietersen, and Bell played in all three matches and each scored fewer than 90 runs in the series. [66] Coach Andy Flower commented that Morgan had struggled during the tour of the UAE, and the batsman was dropped from England's Test squad to tour Sri Lanka in March. [67]
Although he was omitted from the test side, Morgan remained a key figure in the limited overs formats. He made 21 in the first ODI against the West Indies, although he did not bat in the second match. He also only played a small part in the T20 match between the two sides, as he made 2 at the back end of England's innings.

He still played a big part in the limited overs series. He scored 27 as England made 207 in the first ODI, losing by 80 runs. In the second match he made an impressive 73 as England levelled the series. He made 36 not out in the next match as England took a lead in the series. However, Morgan was out for a duck in the final match as England lost by 7 wickets. He was not effective with the bat in the T20 series, scoring just 15 runs in the series, although this was partly due to him having limited time at the crease.
In the World T20, Morgan was seen as a vital player who would have to perform if they were to do well. He made 27 in their opening win against Afghanistan but was out for 2 as England were thrashed by India, but still qualified in second place. He hit 71 runs of just 36 against the West Indies in the first match of the Super Eight stage. However, despite his efforts,a England still lost by 15 runs.

In contrast, he only made 13 from 22 deliveries in the next match as England lost by 55 runs. The series decider was rained off.

He won the one-off match against Ireland where he scored his career best score unbeaten 124 runs along with Ravi Bopara who also scored a maiden century after Ireland scored 269 and English team of was reduced to 48 for 4.

He scored 54, 5 not out, 53 and 30 in ODIs and in T20I he scored duck and 20.
He joined up with the England squad in Australia after they had lost the Ashes 5–0, meaning morale was low. In the first ODI, he made 50 of 47 balls, but England went on to lose by 5 wickets. He made a century in the next match, but England were unable to close the game and lost by a single wicket. Morgan made yet another 50 in the third match, but they lost the game to go 3–0 down in the series. He hit 33 in the next match as England won their first game of the tour, but lost again in the final game where Morgan made 39.

However, they lost their next game to South Africa, with Morgan scoring just six to end their hopes of qualifying. In the final game of the tournament they suffered a humiliating defeat to the Netherlands, with Morgan scoring just six.

In the ODI series against Sri Lanka, Morgan made 3 in the first match. He top scored with 40 in the next game as England were bowled out for 99 to allow Sri Lanka to level the series. He was not needed to bat in the third match as England secured a big win to retake he lead in the series.

After the first game against India was rained off, Morgan made 28 in the second match as England lost to go 1–0 down in the series. He made 10 in the next match as India secured another win, this time by six wickets. He made 32 in the next match as England suffered a humiliating nine wicket defeat.

In the only T20 match between the two sides, Morgan hit 71 from just 31 balls in an innings that included seven sixes. England won the match by three runs and Morgan was named man of the match.
In the return series in Sri Lanka, Morgan endured a poor time. He scored just 19 runs in the first three games as England went 2-1 down in the series. In the fourth game, aalistair Cook was suspended due to a slow over rate in the previous game, and so Morgan took over as captain. He made 62, his only fifty of he tour, although England still went on to lose the game. In the next game Morgan could only make and he was dismissed for a duck in the penultimate game of the series as Sri Lanka secured a series victory. In the final match Morgan again failed to make an impression, this time making just four runs as England suffered another defeat.
On 19 December 2014, 2 months before the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup , it was announced that Cook had been removed as one-day captain, and replaced by Eoin Morgan. This was primarily due to his poor form in ODI cricket. [2]
2015 Tri-Series and 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
Following his appointment as captain, Morgan's first series as skipper was a tournament contested by India, Australia and England. Morgan promised a more aggressive approach as captain and said England would be a more dynamic team. However, they suffered a loss in his first match leading the side against Australia, Morgan himself made an impressive 121 but it was not enough as the rest of England's batsmen struggled. Morgan was not needed to bat in the next match as England secured a comfortable win over India, Morgan's first as permanent captain. He again suffered defeat against Australia in the next game, being dismissed for a duck. England beat India again in the next game to qualify for the final, but Morgan was again unimpressive, making just two. England lost the final to Australia, with Morgan being dismissed for a duck again.
Morgan's poor form continued into the World Cup, where he only scored 90 runs in five innings. [68] His tournament started badly as he was dismissed for a duck in England's opening game against Australia. He made 17 in the next match against New Zealand as England slumped to a humiliating eight wicket defeat. He made 46 against Scotland as England won their first match of the tournament, and made 27 in England's nine wicket defeat against Sri Lanka. He was out for yet another duck in England's must win game against Bangladesh, meaning they exited the tournament. They won their final match against Afghanistan, with Morgan not be required to bat. This meant that England managed to win only 2 out of 6 games in the tournament under Morgan's captaincy, both victories came against much lower ranked teams Afghanistan and Scotland [69]

Morgan continued in his role as ODI captain in the five-game series at home against New Zealand. The series began with a dominant performance by England, winning by 210 runs, Morgan contributing 50. The following match was a much more close-run affair, with New Zealand clinching the match by 13 runs (D/L method). Morgan performed strongly with the bat, scoring 88 off only 47 balls. New Zealand were victorious again in the third match, winning by 3 wickets with an over remaining. Morgan scored 71 in England's innings.

India lost the first Test by an innings and 239 runs at Colombo , where Laxman's first innings score of 50 was the only half-century scored by an Indian batsman in either innings. Laxman scored another fifty in that series, in the third Test, an unbeaten 61 as India went on to lose the game by 8 wickets and the series 2–1. Laxman was dismissed by Mendis on all five occasions in that series. He also crossed the 6000-run milestone during the series.
Laxman was supposed to replace Adam Voges for Nottinghamshire , but this move was vetoed by the BCCI due to the fact that there are players from the rival Indian Cricket League playing for Nottinghamshire.
Against Australia, in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy later that year, Laxman was in top form as he scored 381 runs from 4 Tests with a double-hundred and two fifties. During the third Test at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi, Laxman scored an unbeaten 200 in the first innings with characteristic use of his wrists and flicks through the leg side. In the same innings, Gautam Gambhir scored 206, Laxman and Gambhir becoming the first pair of batsmen to score double-centuries in the same innings for India, and the first to do so against Australia. This was his second double-century in Test cricket with the previous one coming against the same opponents. [60] He made an unbeaten 59 in the second innings and was named Man of the Match. The match was also the last game of India's spin wizard Anil Kumble who was also the captain of the team. In the final Test at Nagpur , Laxman scored another half-century in the first innings of the match.

Early life and background
Dhoni was born in Ranchi , Bihar (now in Jharkhand ), [14] and he identifies as being a Rajput . [15] His paternal village Lvali is in the Lamgarha block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand . Dhoni's parents, moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi where Pan Singh worked in junior management positions in MECON . Dhoni has a sister Jayanti Gupta and a brother Narendra Singh Dhoni. [16] [17] Dhoni is a fan of Adam Gilchrist , and his childhood idols were cricket teammate Sachin Tendulkar , Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan and singer Lata Mangeshkar [18] [19]
Dhoni studied at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali , Ranchi, Jharkhand where he initially excelled in badminton and football and was selected at district and club level in these sports. Dhoni was a goalkeeper for his football team and was sent to play cricket for a local cricket club by his football coach. Though he had not played cricket, Dhoni impressed with his wicket-keeping skills and became the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando cricket club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and he performed well. [17] Dhoni focused on cricket after his 10th standard . [20] Dhoni was a Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station from 2001 to 2003, under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal . His colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee of the Indian Railways. But he also had a mischievous side to his personality. Once, while staying at the railway quarters, Dhoni and a couple of his friends covered themselves in white bedsheets and walked around in the complex late in the night. The night guards were fooled into believing that there were ghosts moving around in the complex. The story made big news on the next day. [21] [22] [23]
Early career
Junior cricket in Bihar
In 1998 Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. [24] Dhoni was included in the Bihar U-19 squad for the 1998–99 season and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings) as the team finished fourth in the group of six and did not make it to the quarter-finals. Dhoni was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad Trophy). Bihar U-19 cricket team advanced to the finals of the 1999–2000 Cooch Behar Trophy where Dhoni made 84 to help Bihar post a total of 357. Bihar's efforts were dwarfed by Punjab U-19s' 839 with Dhoni's future national squad teammate Yuvraj Singh making 358. [25] Dhoni's contribution in the tournament included 488 runs (9 matches, 12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings. [26] Dhoni made it to the East Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy but scored only 97 runs in four matches as East Zone lost all four matches and finished last in the tournament.[ citation needed ]
Bihar cricket team
Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season as an eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against Assam cricket team . [27] Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his maiden first-class century while playing for Bihar against Bengal in the 2000/01 season in a losing cause. [28] Apart from this century, his performance in the 2000/01 season [29] did not include another score over fifty and in the 2001/02 season he scored just five fifties in four Ranji matches. [30]
Jharkhand cricket team
Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the 2003/04 season, Dhoni scored a century (128*) against Assam in the first match of the Ranji ODI tournament. He was part of the East Zone squad that won the Deodhar Trophy that year and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches. In the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni was picked over international cricketer Deep Dasgupta to represent East Zone. [31] He scored a fighting half-century in the second innings in a losing cause. [32]
Dhoni's talent was discovered via the BCCI 's small-town talent-spotting initiative TRDW . Dhoni was discovered by TRDO PC Podar, captain of Bengal in the 1960s, when he saw Dhoni play for Jharkhand at a match in Jamshedpur in 2003, and sent a report to the National Cricket Academy . [33]
India A team
He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the ODI format and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya . [34] Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club , Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match. [35] In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of 223 against Pakistan A with a half-century. [36] Continuing his good performance, he scored back to back centuries – 120 [37] and 119* [38] – against the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then Indian captain – Sourav Ganguly [39] and Ravi Shastri amongst others. However, the India A team coach Sandeep Patil recommended Dinesh Karthik for a place in the Indian squad as wicket-keeper/batsman. [40]
ODI career
ODI Career of Dhoni. Brown line indicates 10 match average while the orange line indicates career average progression.
The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent. [39] The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains ) named in the Test squads. [39] With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05 . [41] Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut. [42] In spite of an average series against Bangladesh , Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series. [43] In the second match of the series , Dhoni, in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries. Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper, [44] a record that he would re-write before the end of the year.
Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series (October–November 2005) and was promoted to No. 3 in the third ODI at Sawai Mansingh Stadium ( Jaipur ). Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar Sangakkara century and, in reply, India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni was promoted to accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for India. [45] The innings was described in Wisden Almanack (2006) as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'. [46] The innings set various records including the highest individual score in ODI cricket in the second innings, [47] a record that still stands. Dhoni ended the series with the highest run aggregate (346) [48] and was awarded the Man of the Series award for his efforts. In December 2005, Dhoni was rewarded a B-grade contract by the BCCI . [49]
Dhoni bowling in the nets. He rarely bowls at international level.
India scored 328 in 50 overs with Dhoni contributing 68 in their first match of 2006 against Pakistan . However, the team finished poorly scoring just 43 runs in the last eight overs and lost the match due to Duckworth-Lewis method . [50] In the third match of the series, Dhoni came in with India in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off just 46 balls that included 13 boundaries to help India take a 2–1 lead in the series. [51] [52] The final match of the series had a repeat performance as Dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable India win the series 4–1. [53] Due to his consistent ODI performances, Dhoni overtook Ricky Ponting as number one in the ICC ODI Rankings for batsmen on 20 April 2006. [54] His reign lasted just a week as Adam Gilchrist 's performance against Bangladesh moved him to the top spot. [55]
Two cancelled series in Sri Lanka, one due to the withdrawal of South Africa from the Unitech Cup due to security concerns [56] and the replacement three-match ODI bilateral series against Sri Lanka washed due to rain, [57] was India's prelude to another disappointing tournament – DLF Cup 2006-07 . Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the finals. India's lack of preparation showed in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy as they lost to West Indies and Australia , though Dhoni scored a half-century against West Indies. The story of the ODI series in South Africa was the same for both Dhoni and India as Dhoni scored 139 runs in 4 matches and India lost the series 4–0. From the start of the West Indies ODI series, Dhoni had played 16 matches, hit just two fifties and averaged 25.93. Dhoni received criticism on his wicket-keeping technique from former wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani . [58]
Preparations for the 2007 Cricket World Cup improved as India recorded identical 3–1 victories over West Indies and Sri Lanka and Dhoni had averages in excess of 100 in both these series. However, India unexpectedly crashed out the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage. Dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the tournament. After the loss to Bangladesh in 2007 Cricket World Cup , the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political activists of JMM . [59] The local police arranged for security for his family as India exited the World Cup in the first round. [60]
Dhoni put his disappointing performances in the World Cup behind him by scoring 91* against Bangladesh after India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. Dhoni was declared the Man of the Match for his performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. He was also later adjudged the Man of the Series after the third game of the series was washed away. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out of 97 balls, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI.
Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa in Ireland and the subsequent India-England seven-match ODI series. [61] Dhoni, who received a 'B' grade contract in December 2005, was awarded an 'A' grade contract in June 2007. And also he was elected as captain of the Indian squad for the World Twenty20 in September 2007. On 2 September 2007, Dhoni equaled his idol Adam Gilchrist's international record for the most dismissals in an innings in ODI by catching five English players and stumping one. [62] He led India to the ICC World Twenty 20 trophy in South Africa with a victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in an intensely fought final on 24 September 2007, and became the second Indian captain to have won a World Cup in any form of cricket, after Kapil Dev . During the series between India and Australia, Dhoni hit an aggressive 124 runs in just 107 balls, in the second ODI, and a measured knock of 71 runs in 95 balls, along with Yuvraj Singh, saw India home by 6 wickets, in the third ODI. Dhoni took his first wicket in international cricket on 30 September 2009. He bowled Travis Dowlin of the West Indies during a match of the 2009 Champions Trophy.

Dhoni topped the ICC ODI Batsman rankings for several months in 2009. Michael Hussey from Australia replaced him at the top spot at the beginning of 2010. [63]
Dhoni had an excellent year in ODIs in 2009 scoring 1198 runs in just 24 innings at an astonishing average of 70.43. Dhoni was also the joint top-scorer in ODIs in 2009 along with Ricky Ponting, but the latter having played in 30 innings.
On 12 February 2012, Dhoni made an unbeaten 44 to guide India to their first win over Australia at Adelaide. In the final over, he hit a monstrous six which traveled 112 metres off the bowling of Clint McKay . During the post-match presentation, he described this six as more important than the one he hit during the ICC World Cup final in 2011. [64]
On 2 November 2013, Dhoni became the second India batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to aggregate 1,000 or more ODI-runs against Australia. [65]
Despite of Dhoni's impressive captaincy in ODIs, India lost to emerging Bangladesh by 2-1 during Indian tour to Bangladesh . This gave Indians, their first series lost against Bangladesh.

Following his good one-day performance against Sri Lanka, Dhoni replaced Dinesh Karthik in December 2005 as the Indian Test wicket-keeper. [66] Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match that was marred by rain. Dhoni came to the crease when the team was struggling at 109/5 and as wickets kept falling around him, he played an aggressive innings and was the last man dismissed. [67] Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second Test and his quick scoring rate (half century came off 51 balls) aided India to set a target of 436 and the Sri Lankans were bowled out for 247. [68]
India toured Pakistan in January–February 2006 and Dhoni scored his maiden century in the second Test at Faisalabad . India were left in a tight spot as Dhoni was joined by Irfan Pathan with the team still 107 away from avoiding a follow-on. Dhoni played his typical aggressive innings as he brought up his maiden Test hundred in just 93 balls after scoring the first fifty in just 34 deliveries. [69]
Dhoni at fielding practice
Dhoni followed the century up with some prosaic batting performances over the next three matches, one against Pakistan that India lost and two against England that had India holding a 1–0 lead. Dhoni was the top scorer in India's first innings in the third Test at Wankhede Stadium as his 64 aided India post a respectable 279 in reply to England's 400. However Dhoni and the Indian fielders dropped catches and missed many dismissal chances including a key stumping opportunity of Andrew Flintoff (14). [70] Dhoni failed to collect the Harbhajan Singh delivery cleanly as Flintoff went on to make 36 more runs as England set a target of 313 for the home team, a target that India were never in the reckoning. A batting collapse saw the team being dismissed for 100 and Dhoni scored just 5 runs and faced criticism for his wicket-keeping lapses as well as his shot selections.
On the West Indies tour in 2006, Dhoni scored a quick and aggressive 69 in the first Test at Antigua . The rest of the series was unremarkable for Dhoni as he scored 99 runs in the remaining 6 innings but his wicket-keeping skills improved and he finished the series with 13 catches and 4 stumpings . In the Test series in South Africa later that year, Dhoni's scores of 34 and 47 were not sufficient to save the second Test against the Proteas as India lost the series 2–1, squandering the chance to build on their first ever Test victory in South Africa (achieved in the first Test match). Dhoni's bruised hands ruled him out of the third Test match. [71]
On the fourth day of the first Test match at Antigua Recreation Ground , St John's , Antigua during India's tour of West Indies, 2006 , Dhoni's flick off Dave Mohammed to the midwicket region was caught by Daren Ganga . As the batsman started to walk back, captain Dravid declared the innings when confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder stepped on the ropes and Dhoni stayed for the umpire's verdict. While the replays were inconclusive, the captain of the West Indies side, Brian Lara , wanted Dhoni to walk off based on the fielder's assertion of the catch. The impasse continued for more than 15 minutes and Lara's temper was on display with finger wagging against the umpires and snatching the ball from umpire Asad Rauf . Ultimately, Dhoni walked off and Dravid's declaration was effected but the game was delayed, and Lara's action was criticised by the commentators and former players. Lara was summoned by the match referee to give an explanation of his actions but he was not fined. [72]
Dhoni scored two centuries in Sri Lanka's tour of India in 2009, a series of three matches in which he led India to a 2–0 victory. With this feat, India soared up to the number one position in Test cricket for the first time in history. India scored 726–9 (decl) in the third match of this series, which is their highest Test total ever. [73]
He played his last series in the 2014–15 season in India's tour of Australia captaining India in the second and third tests; losing the second and drawing the third, trailing the series 2–0 before the Sydney Test. Following the third Test in Melbourne , Dhoni announced his retirement from the format. [74] In his last Test, he effected 9 dismissals (8 catches and 1 stumping), and in the process, went past Kumar Sangakkara in the record for stumpings with 134 (in all three formats combined) [75] and also broke the record for effecting the most dismissals in a match by an Indian wicketkeeper . [76] He finished his last innings unbeaten making 24 runs.
Captaior run, losing 3–0 on a tour of Australia and then 2–0 at home to South Africa. Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again. Ganguly was appointed the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman Ajay Jadeja were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as "the Indian cricket's worst hour". However, the new core – Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly – swore not to let this happen to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times. And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era. [15]
Since 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements with the appointment of John Wright as India's first ever foreign coach . India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001. The series was famous for the Kolkata Test match, in which India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. Australian captain Steve Waugh labelled India as the "Final Frontier" as a result of his side's inability to win a Test series in India. [16] Victory in 2001 against the Australians marked the beginning of a dream run for India under their captain Ganguly, winning Test matches in Zimbabwe , Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. The England series is also known for India's highest ODI run-chase of 325 runs at Lord's which came in the Natwest ODI Series final against England. In the same year, India were joint-winners of the ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka, and then went to the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa where they reached the final only to be beaten by Australia . The 2003–04 season also saw India play out a Test series in Australia where they drew 1–1 with the world champions, and then win a Test and ODI series in Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team in action in the Wankhede Stadium
At the end of the 2004 season, India suffered from lack of form and fitness from its older players. A defeat in a following home Test series against Australia was followed by an ODI home series defeat against Pakistan followed by a Test series levelled 1–1. Greg Chappell took over from John Wright as the coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and his methods proved to be controversial during the beginning of his tenure. The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly, resulting in Rahul Dravid being made captain. This triggered a revival in the team's fortunes, following the emergence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina , and the coming of age of players like Irfan Pathan and Yuvraj Singh . A thumping home series victory over Sri Lanka in 2005 and a drawn series with South Africa put India at second place in the ICC ODI rankings. Dravid, Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were selected to play for the ICC World XI in the 2005 " SuperTest " against Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second. [17] Towards the middle of 2006, however, a 4–1 series loss in the West Indies gave rise to a slump in India's ODI form, while they achieved a 1–0 victory in the Test series that followed, giving them their first Test series victory in the Caribbean since 1971. India's ODI form slumped further with a disappointing performance in the 2006 Champions Trophy and a drubbing in the ODI series in South Africa. This was followed yet again by an initial good performance in the Tests, giving India its first Test match win in South Africa, although they went on to lose the series 2–1. This Test series was marked by Ganguly's comeback to the Indian team. [18]
In December 2006, India played and won its first ever Twenty20 international in South Africa, becoming the most recent Test team to play Twenty20 cricket. The beginning of 2007 had seen a revival in the Indian team's ODI fortunes before the 2007 Cricket World Cup . Series victories against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, marked by the comeback of Ganguly, and strong form by Tendulkar, and the emergence of young players like Robin Uthappa saw many pundits to tip India as a real contender to win the 2007 Cricket World Cup . However, defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw India fail to reach the second round. After winning the Test series against England in August 2007, Dravid stepped down as the captain of the team following which Dhoni was made the captain of the Twenty20 and ODI team. In September 2007, India won the first-ever Twenty20 World Cup held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by 5 runs in the final. In 2007–08, they toured Australia where India lost the controversial Test series 2–1, but managed to win the CB series the following month with a whitewash final of Australia. [19]
In April 2009, India secured their first Test series win in New Zealand in 41 years. After beating Sri Lanka 2–0 in December 2009, India became the No. 1 Test team in the world. They retained the ranking by drawing series against South Africa and Sri Lanka. In October 2010, India whitewashed Australia 2–0 in the home Test series, giving them back-to-back series wins against them. Later that year, India managed to draw the Test series in South Africa at 1–1. [20]

In 2011, he was bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders , who had decided to entirely revamp their team. Bhatia played a key role as for the first time, KKR finished amongst the top teams after the halfway of the group stage and eventually finished in the top four, which led to their qualification for the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 qualifying rounds. Again, Bhatia performed with both bat and ball, to take KKR to the main round, where he took 2/27 in 3.4 overs and was the best bowler. Nevertheless, Somerset won by 5 wickets in the penultimate ball of the innings. [4]

Early life and background
Dhoni was born in Ranchi , Bihar (now in Jharkhand ), [14] and he identifies as being a Rajput . [15] His paternal village Lvali is in the Lamgarha block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand . Dhoni's parents, moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi where Pan Singh worked in junior management positions in MECON . Dhoni has a sister Jayanti Gupta and a brother Narendra Singh Dhoni. [16] [17] Dhoni is a fan of Adam Gilchrist , and his childhood idols were cricket teammate Sachin Tendulkar , Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan and singer Lata Mangeshkar [18] [19]
Dhoni studied at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali , Ranchi, Jharkhand where he initially excelled in badminton and football and was selected at district and club level in these sports. Dhoni was a goalkeeper for his football team and was sent to play cricket for a local cricket club by his football coach. Though he had not played cricket, Dhoni impressed with his wicket-keeping skills and became the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando cricket club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and he performed well. [17] Dhoni focused on cricket after his 10th standard . [20] Dhoni was a Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station from 2001 to 2003, under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal . His colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee of the Indian Railways. But he also had a mischievous side to his personality. Once, while staying at the railway quarters, Dhoni and a couple of his friends covered themselves in white bedsheets and walked around in the complex late in the night. The night guards were fooled into believing that there were ghosts moving around in the complex. The story made big news on the next day. [21] [22] [23]
Early career
Junior cricket in Bihar
In 1998 Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. [24] Dhoni was included in the Bihar U-19 squad for the 1998–99 season and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings) as the team finished fourth in the group of six and did not make it to the quarter-finals. Dhoni was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad Trophy). Bihar U-19 cricket team advanced to the finals of the 1999–2000 Cooch Behar Trophy where Dhoni made 84 to help Bihar post a total of 357. Bihar's efforts were dwarfed by Punjab U-19s' 839 with Dhoni's future national squad teammate Yuvraj Singh making 358. [25] Dhoni's contribution in the tournament included 488 runs (9 matches, 12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings. [26] Dhoni made it to the East Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy but scored only 97 runs in four matches as East Zone lost all four matches and finished last in the tournament.[ citation needed ]
Bihar cricket team
Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season as an eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against Assam cricket team . [27] Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his maiden first-class century while playing for Bihar against Bengal in the 2000/01 season in a losing cause. [28] Apart from this century, his performance in the 2000/01 season [29] did not include another score over fifty and in the 2001/02 season he scored just five fifties in four Ranji matches. [30]
Jharkhand cricket team
Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the 2003/04 season, Dhoni scored a century (128*) against Assam in the first match of the Ranji ODI tournament. He was part of the East Zone squad that won the Deodhar Trophy that year and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches. In the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni was picked over international cricketer Deep Dasgupta to represent East Zone. [31] He scored a fighting half-century in the second innings in a losing cause. [32]
Dhoni's talent was discovered via the BCCI 's small-town talent-spotting initiative TRDW . Dhoni was discovered by TRDO PC Podar, captain of Bengal in the 1960s, when he saw Dhoni play for Jharkhand at a match in Jamshedpur in 2003, and sent a report to the National Cricket Academy . [33]
India A team
He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the ODI format and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya . [34] Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club , Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match. [35] In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of 223 against Pakistan A with a half-century. [36] Continuing his good performance, he scored back to back centuries – 120 [37] and 119* [38] – against the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then Indian captain – Sourav Ganguly [39] and Ravi Shastri amongst others. However, the India A team coach Sandeep Patil recommended Dinesh Karthik for a place in the Indian squad as wicket-keeper/batsman. [40]
ODI career
ODI Career of Dhoni. Brown line indicates 10 match average while the orange line indicates career average progression.
The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent. [39] The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains ) named in the Test squads. [39] With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05 . [41] Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut. [42] In spite of an average series against Bangladesh , Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series. [43] In the second match of the series , Dhoni, in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries. Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper, [44] a record that he would re-write before the end of the year.
Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series (October–November 2005) and was promoted to No. 3 in the third ODI at Sawai Mansingh Stadium ( Jaipur ). Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar Sangakkara century and, in reply, India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni was promoted to accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for India. [45] The innings was described in Wisden Almanack (2006) as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'. [46] The innings set various records including the highest individual score in ODI cricket in the second innings, [47] a record that still stands. Dhoni ended the series with the highest run aggregate (346) [48] and was awarded the Man of the Series award for his efforts. In December 2005, Dhoni was rewarded a B-grade contract by the BCCI . [49]
Dhoni bowling in the nets. He rarely bowls at international level.
India scored 328 in 50 overs with Dhoni contributing 68 in their first match of 2006 against Pakistan . However, the team finished poorly scoring just 43 runs in the last eight overs and lost the match due to Duckworth-Lewis method . [50] In the third match of the series, Dhoni came in with India in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off just 46 balls that included 13 boundaries to help India take a 2–1 lead in the series. [51] [52] The final match of the series had a repeat performance as Dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable India win the series 4–1. [53] Due to his consistent ODI performances, Dhoni overtook Ricky Ponting as number one in the ICC ODI Rankings for batsmen on 20 April 2006. [54] His reign lasted just a week as Adam Gilchrist 's performance against Bangladesh moved him to the top spot. [55]
Two cancelled series in Sri Lanka, one due to the withdrawal of South Africa from the Unitech Cup due to security concerns [56] and the replacement three-match ODI bilateral series against Sri Lanka washed due to rain, [57] was India's prelude to another disappointing tournament – DLF Cup 2006-07 . Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the finals. India's lack of preparation showed in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy as they lost to West Indies and Australia , though Dhoni scored a half-century against West Indies. The story of the ODI series in South Africa was the same for both Dhoni and India as Dhoni scored 139 runs in 4 matches and India lost the series 4–0. From the start of the West Indies ODI series, Dhoni had played 16 matches, hit just two fifties and averaged 25.93. Dhoni received criticism on his wicket-keeping technique from former wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani . [58]
Preparations for the 2007 Cricket World Cup improved as India recorded identical 3–1 victories over West Indies and Sri Lanka and Dhoni had averages in excess of 100 in both these series. However, India unexpectedly crashed out the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage. Dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the tournament. After the loss to Bangladesh in 2007 Cricket World Cup , the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political activists of JMM . [59] The local police arranged for security for his family as India exited the World Cup in the first round. [60]
Dhoni put his disappointing performances in the World Cup behind him by scoring 91* against Bangladesh after India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. Dhoni was declared the Man of the Match for his performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. He was also later adjudged the Man of the Series after the third game of the series was washed away. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out of 97 balls, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI.
Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa in Ireland and the subsequent India-England seven-match ODI series. [61] Dhoni, who received a 'B' grade contract in December 2005, was awarded an 'A' grade contract in June 2007.

[62] He led India to the ICC World Twenty 20 trophy in South Africa with a victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in an intensely fought final on 24 September 2007, and became the second Indian captain to have won a World Cup in any form of cricket, after Kapil Dev . During the series between India and Australia, Dhoni hit an aggressive 124 runs in just 107 balls, in the second ODI, and a measured knock of 71 runs in 95 balls, along with Yuvraj Singh, saw India home by 6 wickets, in the third ODI. Dhoni took his first wicket in international cricket on 30 September 2009. He bowled Travis Dowlin of the West Indies during a match of the 2009 Champions Trophy.

On the West Indies tour in 2006, Dhoni scored a quick and aggressive 69 in the first Test at Antigua . The rest of the series was unremarkable for Dhoni as he scored 99 runs in the remaining 6 innings but his wicket-keeping skills improved and he finished the series with 13 catches and 4 stumpings . In the Test series in South Africa later that year, Dhoni's scores of 34 and 47 were not sufficient to save the second Test against the Proteas as India lost the series 2–1, squandering the chance to build on their first ever Test victory in South Africa (achieved in the first Test match). Dhoni's bruised hands ruled him out of the third Test match. [71]
On the fourth day of the first Test match at Antigua Recreation Ground , St John's , Antigua during India's tour of West Indies, 2006 , Dhoni's flick off Dave Mohammed to the midwicket region was caught by Daren Ganga . As the batsman started to walk back, captain Dravid declared the innings when confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder stepped on the ropes and Dhoni stayed for the umpire's verdict. While the replays were inconclusive, the captain of the West Indies side, Brian Lara , wanted Dhoni to walk off based on the fielder's assertion of the catch. The impasse continued for more than 15 minutes and Lara's temper was on display with finger wagging against the umpires and snatching the ball from umpire Asad Rauf . Ultimately, Dhoni walked off and Dravid's declaration was effected but the game was delayed, and Lara's action was criticised by the commentators and former players. Lara was summoned by the match referee to give an explanation of his actions but he was not fined. [72]
Dhoni scored two centuries in Sri Lanka's tour of India in 2009, a series of three matches in which he led India to a 2–0 victory. With this feat, India soared up to the number one position in Test cricket for the first time in history. India scored 726–9 (decl) in the third match of this seriof Praveen Kumar, Sreesanth and Munaf Patel. But Ishant has taken the setbacks in his stride.
"Being in and out of sides is part and parcel of a sportsperson's life and I'd like to take it on the chin," he said. "I am just trying to forget the past and start afresh. Right now, the focus is on IPL and I want to give it my 100%. I will do my best for Hyderabad."
Despite having a Twenty20 economy rate close to eight runs an over, Ishant feels that the format is as much a challenge for the batsmen as it is for the bowlers. "You've got to go with your instincts, believe in your strong points and bowl to your strength rather than think about the batsmen's plus points.
"I have worked on and added variations to my bowling armoury and will hopefully execute them to good effect in the IPL. The slower ones, the yorkers are all key deliveries in this format and you have to use them judiciously. You've got to change your line and length constantly and plan every ball.
"The margin of error for a fast bowler is minimal but I feel the key is to keep it simple. One has to be on top of the game and not complicate things. Zaheer Khan's approach at the recently concluded World Cup is a case in point."
Deccan play their first game against Rajasthan Royals in Hyderabad on April 9.

Comments
India were outplayed in the first two ODIs before the third and final match was called off midway yesterday. Ishant, who returned to some form with figures of 4/40 in the abandoned game, said things are not as bad as they seem.
India might have come a cropper in the just-concluded ODI series against South Africa but pacer Ishant Sharma said there are some positives to be gained from the 0-2 drubbing and the visitors would try to utilise them in the upcoming two Tests.
India were outplayed in the first two ODIs before the third and final match was called off midway yesterday. Ishant, who returned to some form with figures of 4/40 in the abandoned game, said things are not as bad as they seem.
"Everyone is an international player in both the teams and it's all in the mind. If you can control your thought process, and you are confident in your mind and you know what you have to do, then I don't think it is such a big loss," the pacer said in the post-match press conference.
"We lost the series yes, but we have some positives to take from it as well. And we will be utilising them in the Test series," he added.
In the course of his 4/40 yesterday, Ishant collected his 100th wicket in 70 matches when he dismissed Ryan McLaren.
"Initially there was bounce in the wicket and then it got a bit slow," he said, talking about the Proteas' innings that finished at 301 for 8.
"We need to use the variations on these kind of wickets because the pitch was a bit dry. The wind blows from different directions and the captain tends to rotate his bowlers. Each of us is a different bowler and we are given a chance to perform, which is a good thing."
Rain came during the innings break and India never got a chance to bat. It was a huge opportunity missed, at least on paper, as the visitors are yet to make a mark on this tour.
In three matches, Quinton de Kock was the biggest thorn in the Men in Blue's flesh. He struck three successive centuries to leave the bowling attack gasping for breath.
"It's good for him that he got runs. But I think he was very lucky, especially today," opined Ishant.
"In all three matches, he has given top edges which have gone through gaps, half chances all of them. And today he was dropped twice."
"Everyone looks at how many matches we have played, but if you can see the average age, we are young in that respect as a bowling unit. Everyone is learning. We make mistakes, and we learn, trying to keep things simple. It becomes easier then," he added, talking about the improvement in the team's bowling performance as the series progressed.

India in England 2011 August 22, 2011
Varun Aaron says he won't compromise on pace

Varun Aaron , the Jharkhand fast bowler who has replaced Ishant Sharma in India's ODI squad for the England series, said he will not cut back on his pace as his career progresses because he loves bowling fast. Indian fast bowlers have a history of dropping their pace dramatically as their careers take off - Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel and to some extent Ishant Sharma - but Aaron, who regularly clocks over 140kph and impressed for India Emerging Players during the recent tournament in Australia, said he will not go down that road.
"It's an individual thing, I guess. I don't know why they decided to give up on their pace. I love bowling fast, and it is my strength. I will never compromise on my pace," he told the Indian Express. "And it's a lot of fun to hit people on the head."
Aaron, who played for Delhi Daredevils in this year's IPL, does know the value of accuracy too. "Speed is okay; you have to bowl quick. But it troubles international batsmen only to a certain extent. After that, they adjust pretty easily," he told Reuters. "You have got to have a few tricks up your sleeve and you have got to bowl a good line and length consistently to get wickets. Even genuine fast bowlers have to have the right line and length."
With India struggling in the pace department in England, there were calls for Aaron, who is just 21, to be drafted into the national team, and when Ishant sustained an ankle injury, Aaron was called up to the one-day squad. He, however, said he would not be bogged down by the pressure of expectation. "It's tough to ignore the expectations that people have. But I don't want to think about that and I'm concentrating on bowling as fast and as well as I can."
One thing that could work in Aaron's favour is that the assistant coach at Delhi Daredevils is Eric Simons, who is also India's bowling coach. "Working with Eric was great," Aaron said. "Generally, he just tells you to do the most basic of things perfectly or a small little change here or there which somehow you fail to notice. But I am always open to advice."
Aaron took 13 wickets for Jharkhand during last year's Ranji season, followed by another nine in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, during which he reportedly bowled a 153-kph ball. He took 10 wickets in three games in the three-day leg of the Emerging Players Tournament , including 4 for 40 in the first innings against Australia Institute of Sport.

Domestic career[ edit ]
He made his First-class debut against Punjab at Ludhiana in the 1993/94 season. He was an integral part of the North Zone team which lifted the Duleep and Deodhar Trophies in 1999-2000, and also captained Delhi for some time. He retired from all forms of cricket after playing his last match against Uttar Pradesh in December 2006. [1] Just before retirement, he began his Ranji season with a fine 152, his highest first-class score, against Tamil Nadu that bailed Delhi out of trouble, and effected a stumping against Uttar Pradesh 's Praveen Kumar that helped his side gain a vital first-innings lead.
International Career[ edit ]
His international debut was in an ODI against Kenya at Nairobi Gymkhana in October 2000 in the ICC Knockout Trophy . His contribution in that match which India eventually won was a stumping and a catch. He went on to play in total 19 ODI's for India.
The last of which was against Australia at Fatorda Stadium in the 2001 series. His highest ODI score was a knock of 51 off 39 deliveries against Australia in the 1st ODI at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium which helped set up a match winning total of 315.
He made his Test debut against Zimbabwe at his home ground Feroz Shah Kotla in November 2000 as the match ended in drawn. He played only one more Test match against same opponent at Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium . In two he took 6 catches and scored unbeaten 2 runs in an innings which he played. [1]
Coaching Career[ edit ]
He was named Delhi coach in 2007/08 season and was sacked 2013/14 season due his Kolkata Knight Riders commitments. During this period he led them to a Ranji Trophy triumph in 2007-08 season to end a 16-year title drought. He was appointed the assistant coach of the IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders in 2009. [2]
In September 2014, he was re-appointed as the head coach of the Delhi 's Ranji Trophy side for 2014/15 season. [3]

Early and personal life[ edit ]
Pietersen was born to an English mother, Penny, and an Afrikaner father, Jannie. [3] Pietersen had a strict and well-disciplined childhood, along with his three brothers Tony, Greg and Bryan; [22] he learned valuable lessons from this "fantastic" approach to parenting, and said: "Discipline is good. It taught me that I didn't always have to have what I wanted; that what I needed was different from what I wanted." [23] Bryan plays club and second XI cricket in England. [24]
Pietersen attended Maritzburg College , Pietermaritzburg , and made his first-class cricket debut for Natal 's B team in 1997, aged 17, where he was regarded predominantly as an off spin bowler and a hard-hitting lower-order batsman. [25] [26] After two seasons, he moved to England for a five-month spell as the overseas player for club side Cannock CC, helping them win the Birmingham and District Premier League in 2000. [27] This first spell away from home did not leave him with fond memories for England, in particular "those horrible Black Country accents" referring to a dialect of the West Midlands , living in a single room above a squash court, and working in the club bar. [23] However, he returned to newly renamed KwaZulu Natal side a better cricketer; a lack of opportunities to bowl had improved his batting. [27]
Having seen Pietersen play at a school cricket festival, Clive Rice invited him to sign for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club . Pietersen accepted without hesitation, keen to make the most of top-class cricket under a coach for whom he had the utmost admiration. He did not at this stage contemplate forsaking his nation; nor had it yet occurred to him that the decision would eventually have to be taken. [28]
Pietersen is widely portrayed in the media as having a self-assured personality, described by Geoffrey Boycott as being "cocky and confident". [29] Former England test captain Michael Vaughan counters this, saying, "KP is not a confident person. He obviously has great belief in his ability but that's not quite the same thing... And I know KP wants to be loved. I try to text him and talk to him as often as I can because I know he is insecure." [30] He has been noted for unusual haircuts, with his peroxide blond dyed streak of hair along the middle of his head during the 2005 Ashes series being described as a "dead skunk" look. [31] During the 2006–07 Ashes tour, the Australian team, noted for their efforts to dominate opponents psychologically, dubbed him "The Ego", or "FIGJAM" (F*** I'm Good, Just Ask Me). [32] Other nicknames include "KP", "Kelves" and "Kapes". [3]
Kevin Pietersen published his autobiography: Kevin Pietersen: Crossing the Boundary in early 2007. A second biography: Kevin Pietersen: Portrait of a Rebel written by journalist Marcus Stead, was published in the autumn of 2009. This book includes a detailed account of the controversies of Pietersen's reign as England captain. A revised and updated version of Stead's book, now titled 'KP – The Biography' which brought his story up-to-date, was published in July 2013. KP: The Autobiography was published in October 2014, ghost written by Irish sports journalist David Walsh . [33]
Pietersen is married to Liberty X singer Jessica Taylor . [34] The couple married on 29 December 2007 at St Andrew's Church in Castle Combe , Wiltshire, with former England team-mate Darren Gough acting as best man. [35]
Jessica gave birth to the couple's first child, a son Dylan, on 11 May 2010. Pietersen made a dash back across the Atlantic, from where he was on tour with the England side, in Barbados, West Indies, in a bid to be present at the birth. He arrived at the hospital just in time for the birth. On the arrival of his son, Pietersen said "This really is the most amazing experience of my life." [36]
In November 2015 he announced that him and his wife are expecting their second child.
Domestic career[ edit ]
". . . a young off-spinning opponent of ours walked into the England dressing room after taking a few wickets for KwaZulu Natal in a tour match in Durban and plonked himself down next to me, asking if I knew of any English teams he could play for. I thought he meant club cricket and almost gave him my brother's number and told him to try Fives and Heronians but it turned out he had bigger ambitions than that..." [37]
— Nasser Hussain on Kevin Pietersen, Mail Online
He impressed members of Nasser Hussain 's England side when playing for KwaZulu Natal in 1999; he took four top-order wickets and, despite batting at number nine, scored 61 not out from 57 balls, hitting four sixes. [38] Hussain then recommended that Pietersen secure a contract with an English county side. [39]
Despite the praise from the England side, Pietersen claimed he was dropped from the Natal first team. Pietersen felt that this was due to the country's racial quota system, in which provincial sides were required to have at least four black players. [3] [40] [41] Pietersen's view was that players should be judged on merit, and described it as "heartbreaking" when he was left out of the side, although he later reflected "it turned out it was the best thing that could have happened". [42] Pietersen has since firmly criticised the quota system, [43] which he feels forced him out of the country of his birth. He has also criticised Graeme Smith , who became captain of the South African side in 2003, calling him "an absolute muppet, childish and strange" and that his behaviour "leaves a lot to be desired". [44] Smith opposed this, saying, "I'm patriotic about my country, and that's why I don't like Kevin Pietersen. The only reason that Kevin and I have never had a relationship is because he slated South Africa". [45] Pietersen's outspoken views published in his autobiography, Crossing the Boundary, in September 2006, and in an interview for the South African edition of GQ magazine, led to unsuccessful calls for an ICC investigation regarding bringing the game into disrepute. [40] [46]
In 2000, Nottinghamshire coach Clive Rice , who had seen Pietersen play in 1997 in South Africa at a schools week, heard that Pietersen was playing club cricket for the Cannock Cricket Club and offered him a three-year contract to play for the county. [26] His maiden first-class century came on his Nottinghamshire debut against Loughborough UCCE . [47] In his first season he made 1,275 runs with an impressive batting average of 57.95, [48] including 218 not out in an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 352 with John Morris at Derby in July, after having been out lbw for a duck in the first innings. [49] These performances led to praise in the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack : "If he can maintain his first season's form, the name of Pietersen should be pencilled in for future Test squads." [48] This form did indeed continue into the following year: he made another unbeaten double-century, against Middlesex , taking part in a partnership of 316 for the fourth wicket with Darren Bicknell . [50] This period proved to be a purple patch for the batsman, scoring four consecutive centuries (254 not out, 122, 147 and 116) in one week in August. [51]
In 2003, Pietersen scored 1,546 first-class runs, and 764 runs in limited overs cricket . [47] [52] He was selected for the 2003/04 ECB National Academy tour of India, and had a successful tour scoring 523 runs including three centuries in his six first-class innings to record an average of 104.60, [53] and making 131 in a one-day match against India A in Bangalore . [54]
After Nottinghamshire were relegated in 2003, Pietersen requested a release from his contract, saying "I haven't been happy for a while....The pitch at Trent Bridge has been one of my problems... I could have done so much better if the wicket had been good." [55] This led to a public row with club captain Jason Gallian , where Gallian allegedly threw Pietersen's kit off the Trent Bridge balcony and broke his bat:
During the game I told the captain that I was not happy and that I wanted to leave. After the game we spoke in the dressing room and then I went to have dinner. I got a call saying the captain had trashed my equipment. I was told the captain had said, 'if he does not want to play for Notts he can f*** off.' I have not spoken to Gallian since, nor have I received an apology. [56]
Pietersen was made to honour the last year of his contract at Nottinghamshire, but "didn't enjoy it at all". [57] In October 2004, he joined Hampshire under the captaincy of Shane Warne . [58]
After becoming a regular in the national side, Pietersen rarely got an opportunity to play domestic cricket. Having an England "central contract" meant that Pietersen was only released to play for Hampshire at the discretion of the national coach. After being left out of the national side to face Bangladesh in May 2005, Pietersen had several good innings in the English County Championship , including two centuries. [59] He only played twice for the county in 2006, and appeared just once in 2007, with an unbeaten 66 against Ireland . [60] Pietersen's last first-class match for Hampshire came in the 2008 County Championship against Somerset , where he scored 100 runs in Hampshire's first innings, [61] and following the birth of his son, a desire to stay in London led to him announcing he would leave Hampshire at the end of the 2010 season. [62]
Pietersen then joined Surrey on loan from Hampshire for the remainder of the 2010 English county cricket season. [6] He scored a century in his first Clydesdale Bank 40 appearance against Sussex , with 116 off 105 deliveries. [63] It was his first limited overs century since 2008 , and his first century of any kind since March 2009 . He subsequently signed permanently for Surrey from the 2011 season onwards. [7] Pietersen had also rejoined his old team in South Africa, the Dolphins, for a short stint in October 2010. [7] [64]
In February 2014, Delhi Daredevils of Indian Premier League bought Pietersen for USD 1.5 Million for the 2014 Indian Premier League season, [65] and he captained the team for that season. [66] Pietersen had previously played for the Delhi Daredvils during the 2012 Indian Premier League Season.
In July 2014, he played for the Rest of the World side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's . [67]
Pietersen was signed by the Melbourne Stars in 2014–15 Big Bash League season , with a contract for 2 years.; [68] he was seen as a "big hit" for the 2014–15 Big Bash League season . [69] On 18 December 2014, Kevin Pietersen played his first match in 2014–15 Big Bash League season as the no.3 batsmen, and scored 66 runs off 46 balls. [70] Pietersen also plays T20 cricket in the Caribbean Premier League , having signed for St Lucia Zouks for the 2014 Caribbean Premier League season. [71]
In the 2015 Indian Premier League auction, Kevin Pietersen was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for 2 Crore Rupees. [72] However, Pietersen was released by Sunrisers Hyderabad prior to the start of the tournament, [73] although he could play in the latter stages of the 2015 Indian Premier League season. [74] Instead, Pietersen rejoined Surrey, to play County Championship matches, [74] with an aim of playing for England again, [75] although new England director Andrew Strauss said that he wouldn't happen. [76] In May 2015, Pietersen scored his highest first-class score of 355 * , [77] before injury prevented him going to the IPL. [78]
England debut[ edit ]
Pietersen is eligible to play for England as he has an English mother. After a qualifying period of four years playing at English county level, he was called up almost immediately for his international debut against Zimbabwe in 2004. [79]
The tour of Zimbabwe caused several players to voice their concerns about the Robert Mugabe regime, the security issues in the country and the standard of the Zimbabwean side. [80] Steve Harmison was the first to boycott the tour for "political and sporting reasons", [81] and all-rounder Andrew Flintoff was reported to be considering taking a moral stand himself. The England Chairman of Selectors David Graveney denied that the selectors would leave out players unhappy with touring Zimbabwe and would put their absences down to injury. [82] Flintoff was, however, "rested" and Pietersen rushed into the squad "at the earliest opportunity". [83] In the five match ODI series, Pietersen batted in three innings which included a score of 77 not out; he finished the series with an average of 104.00 as England won the series 4–0.
Success in South Africa[ edit ]
Pietersen was upset not to be initially in the squad to tour South Africa. [84] With Flintoff withdrawing due to injury, [85] Pietersen was recalled to the squad, [86] and cemented his place in the first team with 97 off 84 balls in the warm-up match against South Africa A, in the face of a hostile crowd. [87] Throughout the tour, Pietersen was subjected to a barrage of abuse from the South African crowd, who regarded him somewhat like a traitor . [25] He said:
I knew I was going to cop a lot of stick but it will be like water off a duck's back...I expected stick at the start of the innings, and I'm sure it will carry on through the whole series. But I just sat back and laughed at the opposition, with their swearing and 'traitor' remarks... some of them can hardly speak English. My affiliation is with England. In fact, I'm starting to speak too much like Darren Gough ... In fact, I'm going to get one of Gough's tattoos with three lions and my number underneath...No one can say I'm not English. [88]
Pietersen scored a 96-ball 108 not out in the tied second ODI at Bloemfontein , after which the crowd turned their backs on him as he returned to the pavilion. [89] This score set his ODI average at an incredible record 234.00. [90] [91] He made 75 at Cape Town , [92] then at East London Pietersen made an unbeaten 100 from only 69 balls, the fastest century by an England player in a one-day match, [93] although England still lost by eight runs. In the final game at Centurion Park , Pietersen came to the wicket at 32/3 and scored 116, but again could not prevent a defeat. Pietersen ended the series, which England lost 4–1, with 454 runs in five innings, and the Player of the Series award. [94] [95] By the end of the series, the South African crowds had generally replaced hostility with respect for Pietersen, his final century being awarded a standing ovation. [96]
Despite press speculation, Pietersen was not picked for the Tests against Bangladesh —his early season form being dogged by a foot injury [97] —but with his county form improving, he was selected for the Twenty20 match against Australia at Southampton , making 34 from 18 balls and taking three catches as England won by 100 runs being awarded man of the match in the process. [98]
In the triangular ODI series against Australia and Bangladesh, Pietersen did not get to bat in the first match at The Oval as England won by 10 wickets, but scored 91 off 65 balls in the match in Bristol against Australia. [99] In the remainder of the triangular series, Pietersen scored quickly, although without other half-centuries. In the final of the NatWest Series , he only made 6 as he finished the seven-match series with a total of 278 runs at an average of 46.33. [100] Pietersen's performances sparked speculation over whether he would be brought into the Test side for The Ashes later in the summer. [101] Later in July, Pietersen played in all three matches of the (ODI) NatWest Challenge against Australia. In the final match he was the top scorer for England with 74 runs; however, he was forced off the field in the third over of Australia's reply with a groin injury. [102]
2005 Ashes triumph[ edit ]

Speculation over when Pietersen would play for the Test team was ended in July with the announcement by the England chairman of selectors, David Graveney , that Pietersen had been selected ahead of Thorpe. [103] He made his debut in the first Ashes Test at Lord's , becoming the 626th player to play for the national side. [104] He came into bat at 18–3 and he made 57 on debut in his first innings. In the second innings, he similarly came in after a batting collapse and finished making a second half-century and finished the innings on 64 not out, becoming only the fourth player to top score in both innings on debut for England, the eighth England player to score a half-century in each innings on his debut, and the third cricketer to do so at Lord's. [105] England were thrashed by 239 runs before moving onto Edgbaston where he came in a more comfortable position scoring 71 in the first innings. He had a good partnership with Andrew Flintoff where the pair put on 103 very quickly. He made 20 in the second innings coming in at 31–4. He was involved in two controversial decisions. He gloved his first ball from Brett Lee , but the umpire turned down the appeal. Later, Shane Warne bowled a ball which hit his pad then elbow before being caught by Adam Gilchrist , and he was given out. The match ended with England narrowly winning by 2 runs. [106]
In the drawn third Test, Pietersen had his first quiet match when he scored 21 in the first innings, getting caught on the boundary. Then, with England looking to push on he was unfortunately dismissed lbw to Glenn McGrath for a golden duck . In the fourth test win at his former home ground Trent Bridge , he scored 45 in the first innings after facing 108 balls looking to build a big score. In the second innings chasing 129 to win, he was in at 57–4 when he scored 23 in a decent partnership again with Flintoff . He was dismissed when he was caught behind wafting at a ball outside off stump. However, England won and went 2–1 up. [107] [108] Under pressure to post a large score in the final Test at The Oval , Pietersen did not contribute significantly in the first innings with 14 as he was bowled for the first time in his Test career by Shane Warne . In the second innings, Pietersen was dropped on 0 by a combination of Gilchrist and Hayden , on 15 by his Hampshire colleague Shane Warne and after reaching fifty on 60 by Shaun Tait . He reached his maiden test century with a driven four off the bowling of Tait before making 158, eventually being dismissed by Glenn McGrath . This innings helped to secure the return of the Ashes to England for the first time since the late 1980s. [47] [109] His innings included seven sixes, breaking Ian Botham's record for the most sixes by an English player in an Ashes innings. [110] Pietersen was named Man of the Match for his efforts, [111] and finished the series as top scorer, with 473 runs over the five Tests, an average of 52.55 which also was the highest in the series. [112] However, he had a less successful series in the field, dropping six catches in the five Tests, a point he made wryly when questioned about the Australians dropping him three times on the final day. [113] Pietersen was given an ECB central contract to reflect his place in the national side. [114]

Kevin Pietersen in Twenty20 action in 2006
Pietersen had a less successful time in the three Test matches against Pakistan , which England lost 2–0. He made little impact in the first and third test. His first Test match innings since his match winning 158 against Australia was brief as he was caught at short leg for 5. In the second innings, he was criticised for his dismissal. Chasing just 198, he was caught behind after a horrible slog on 19 as England went on to lose by 22 runs. In the third test, he made 34 before edging behind in the first innings. With England in difficulty, Pietersen edged Danish Kaneria to short leg when only on one, as England were to be defeated by an innings. [115] [116] He fared better in the second, however, making his second Test century in the first innings. He brought up his hundred with a six before next ball, he top-edged a pull and was out. In the next innings, with England needing to bat out a draw, England were 20–4 but he made 42 to help England get the draw. [117] He was also performing well in the one-day series with two explosive innings of 56 from 39 balls to help England win the first ODI, and 28 from 27 balls in the second. [118] [119] The quick-scoring innings in the second ODI was to be Pietersen's last on the tour. A rib injury sustained in the first ODI proved too painful throughout the second, and Pietersen returned to England to recover fully for the tour of India. [120]
In March 2006, Pietersen played in the three Tests against India , which England drew 1–1. In the first innings on 15, another rash shot brought his downfall. He pulled a ball from Sreesanth onto his stumps. His 87 in the second innings of the first match came during England's acceleration period, helping push the required target over 300. [121] England then declared overnight, and India successfully batted out the final day to secure a draw. This half-century was followed by another in the first innings of the second Test. Again, he gave his wicket away on 64 when he offered Munaf Patel a return catch. The second innings was not so good, facing just 13 balls before being given out caught behind off a Harbhajan Singh delivery. The unhappy Pietersen was later fined 30 percent of his match fee for shaking his head and showing signs of dissent. [122] "Replays demonstrated that the ball that had dismissed him had brushed his forearm, not his glove, before ballooning up into the hands of Rahul Dravid at slip. But umpire Darrell Hair gave him out for 4 as England collapsed on the fourth afternoon." [122] Pietersen posted a score of 39 in the first innings of the third test before he got a beauty from Sreesanth which moved and took the edge of the bat before being caught by Mahendra Singh Dhoni . In the second innings, he posted 7 again being caught and bowled, this time by Anil Kumble via a leading edge. Despite a quiet match for him, England won comfortably after a dismal 100 all out in India's second visit to the crease. [123]
In the one-day series, which England lost 5–1, he was top scorer for England in four out of the five matches he played, and had the highest average of any player with 58.20. [124] His 71 in the second ODI took him past 1,000 ODI runs, equalling Viv Richards ' record of 21 innings to reach this total. [13]
Sri Lanka and Pakistan in England, 2006[ edit ]
See also: Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 2006 and Pakistani cricket team in England in 2006
In May 2006, Pietersen matched his highest Test score of 158 in the first match against Sri Lanka . His innings was ended when he was lbw to Chaminda Vaas . [125] In the second test he made 142 at Edgbaston . He made almost half of England's runs. After he made his hundred, his third six, saw the introduction to the Switch hit when he turned out and played a switch hit sweep off Muttiah Muralitharan . This took him past the milestone of 1,000 Test runs, in his 12th Test match, and he became the first batsman since Graham Gooch in 1990 to score a century in three successive Test innings on English soil. [126] This performance moved Pietersen into the top ten of the ICC cricket ratings . In the third test, he was twice removed by Murali . In the first innings, on 41, he top edged a sweep to short fine leg. In the second innings with England chasing 325, he was caught at short leg for just 6. Despite this, his performances in the first two tests earned him the England (Test match) Player of the Series. [127] [128] In the first and second tests of the Pakistan series, he got starts with the bat but didn't get past 50. He was lbw offering no shot in the first innings at Lords for 21. In the second innings, when England were pushing on, he played some nice strokes in his 41 before being stumped of the bowling of Shahid Afridi . In the second test, he made 38 when he hit a half-volley loosely to point. In the third test at Headingley , he hit 135 runs from England's total of 515. [129] In the final controversial test at The Oval , on a horribly wet pitch, he got the second golden duck of his Test career when he edged behind. In the second innings, he made 96 before edging behind again before the test came to an unexpected early end.
Asif bowls Pietersen for a duck
Pietersen bowled his first delivery in Test match cricket on 4 June, against Sri Lanka. [130] His first Test wicket came against Pakistan later in the summer when Kamran Akmal got a thin edge through to Geraint Jones . [131] Later in June, Pietersen scored 17 in the Twenty20 International as England lost by 2 runs to Sri Lanka. [132] The twenty over match against Pakistan was no better, Pietersen being bowled by Mohammad Asif for a golden duck as Pakistan helped themselves to a five-wicket victory. [133]
England in Australia, 2006–07[ edit ]
See also: 2006-07 Ashes series and English cricket team in Australia in 2006–07
In the much-anticipated Ashes series in Australia, Pietersen was hyped up as England's best player and this was justified as he scored 490 runs in five matches and averaged over fifty, despite Australia's obvious targeting of him. "I was interested to see how he would get on in Australia in 2006–07 on pitches with more bounce", wrote Warne, "because bowlers had tried to test him with the short ball. He was still England's best batsman." [134]
He started well, in the First Test. Despite a failure of 16 in the first test, he produced a fine spell of batting with a good 92 in the second innings. This wasn't enough to save England from a 277 run defeat. [135] In the second Test, he backed up his good form with a century in the Second Test in Adelaide , sharing a 310-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Paul Collingwood. When he was eventually run out, his first reaction was to "giggle" because it was the third time in his Test career that he had scored exactly 158 runs, which was, at that point, his highest Test score. However, he made 2 in a disastrous second innings collapse which cost England dear. [136] In the third test, he was the only batsman to offer any resistance with 70 in the first innings and 60 not out in the second innings in a defeat which cost England the Ashes. However, he couldn't carry on that form as he failed to make a half-century in the final two tests as England lost 5–0. [137]
Pietersen bowls off-spin in the Adelaide Oval nets in November 2006.
In the tour's sole Twenty20 match, Pietersen was run out on eleven as England lost by 77 runs. [138] In the first One Day International of the 2006–07 Commonwealth Bank Series , on 12 January at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , Pietersen was injured when a ball bowled by Glenn McGrath hit him on the ribs. Despite continuing his innings in some discomfort, making 82, X-rays revealed a fracture, and Pietersen was forced to miss the rest of the series. [139]
Career in 2007[ edit ]
See also: 2007 Cricket World Cup
In the 2007 Cricket World Cup , England started in Group C with a game against New Zealand in which KP made 60 before holing out. He made another 50 against Kenya but disappointedly made just 5 against Canada as England sealed qualification. He made 48 in the unconvincing win against Ireland. Pietersen made 58 against Sri Lanka before being caught and bowled by Murali . England lost that game by 2 runs before losing the next game against Australia by 7 wickets. Pietersen crafted 104 runs off 122 balls against Australia. It was the first World Cup century by an Englishman since 1996, and the first ever against Australia. [140] His efforts in the World Cup helped him achieve the status of International Cricket Council number-one ranked batsman in the world for ODIs. [141] He then failed making 10 against Bangladesh and 3 against South Africa. England lost to South Africa meaning that England did not reach the semi-finals. In England's final match of the World Cup against the West Indies , Pietersen made 100 from 91 balls, and effected the run-out of retiring captain Brian Lara . [142] This century took him past 2,000 ODI runs, in doing so equalling the record 51 matches set by Zaheer Abbas . [14] He finished the tournament with 444 runs, at an average of 55.5, and was described as shining in the England team "like a 100 watt bulb in a room full of candles". [143]
West Indies in England[ edit ]
See also: West Indian cricket team in England in 2007
In the first test of the series he was dismissed for 26 again chasing a wide one when looking set also after 4 centuries were scored by England batsmen in the innings at Lord's , he then scored a hundred in the second innings when England were looking to accelerate. [144] Pietersen posted his highest score of 226 in the second Test at Headingley (it was scored in 262 balls, with 24 fours and 2 sixes), surpassing his previous best of 158 which he had achieved three times. [145] With this score, Pietersen moved ahead of Everton Weekes and Viv Richards to be the batsman with the second-highest run-total out of his first 25 Tests (behind Don Bradman ). [15] It is also the highest Test score for England since Graham Gooch scored 333 against India in 1990. [146] This innings subjected the West Indies to an innings and 283 runs defeat, their largest against any team. Pietersen, the Man of the Match, said, "I believe the recipe for success is hard work. I've been criticised for throwing my wicket away, and I tried to make it count here". [147]
In the third Test at Old Trafford , he carried on his bad run at the ground being bounced out twice for 9 and 68. In the second innings, Pietersen lost his wicket in a bizarre dismissal when West Indian all-rounder Dwayne Bravo delivered a bouncer which knocked Pietersen's helmet off his head and onto his stumps. He is only the fourth batsman in Test cricket to be dismissed " hit wicket " as a result of headgear falling onto the stumps. [148] This score took him past the 8,500 first-class runs mark, and 2,500 runs in Test cricket. [149] In the final match of the series, he registered his third duck of his Test career in the first innings and 28 in the second innings as England won the series 3–0.
In contrast, Pietersen's batting was poor in the following single innings matches; he scored a total of 77 runs in five matches (two Twenty20 and three ODI), recording a second-ball duck in the final ODI. [150] He subsequently fell to second in the official One Day International batting rankings, behind Ricky Ponting . [151] Pietersen himself commented that his lack of form was a result of "fatigue", and reiterated his calls for a less "hectic" match schedule. [152]
India tour and Twenty20 Championship[ edit ]

Pietersen batting during the second Test of India's tour of England in 2007
Pietersen played in the first Test against India and in the first innings, he made 37 but not without controversy. He edged the ball behind of Zaheer Khan to Dhoni. He walked, but after seeing replays on the screen, he walked back to the middle and the decision was overturned. Ironically, he was out shortly afterwards caught Dhoni, bowled Khan. In the second innings he was top scorer with a knock of 134 to set up a potential England victory. Pietersen described this as his best century, in very testing conditions. [153] In the second test, he was twice lbw to RP Singh for 13 and 19 in a defeat which subsequently cost them the series. After making 41 in the first innings, Pietersen scored his 10th Test century in the third and final Test at the Oval, helping England to draw the game with 101. [154] In the one-day series that followed, he struggled at the start with a top score of 33 not out in the first five matches of the series. He scored two half-centuries in the final matches including 71 not out in the final match at Lord's, hitting the winning runs to give England the series.
Pietersen was also picked for and played in the Twenty20 Championship in South Africa. In England's first game against Zimbabwe on 13 September, Pietersen hit 79 runs off 37 balls, his highest Twenty20 score, including seven fours and four sixes (one of them being another switch-hit sweep for six) in an English total of 188–9. England won the match by 50 runs; however, this was to be Pietersen's largest contribution in the competition. He scored another 99 runs over four more matches, ending the series with an average of 35.60. He also scored the most England fours (17) and jointly held the record for the most England sixes (6) with Owais Shah . He also held the highest strike rate of any England batsman. [155]
Sri Lanka 2007[ edit ]
See also: English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2007–08
Pietersen scored 50 in England's opening game in Sri Lanka against the Sri Lankan Cricket XI, [156] but it took until the fourth ODI for Pietersen to find form, scoring 63 not out as England won their first series in Sri Lanka. [157] This form was still fluctuating in the warm-up matches for the Test series, scoring 4, 1 and 59 against the Sri Lankan Cricket XI. This run continued in the Test matches when in the first test he got two starts with 31 and 18 but didn't go on. He was unfortunate as in the second innings on 18 he was bowled by a ball that kept low from Dilhara Fernando . In the second test he managed 45 not out to secure a draw in the 2nd Test. In the first innings, Pietersen's dismissal was to be the source of much controversy. He edged his fifth ball to Chamara Silva at slip, who flicked the ball up for wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara to complete the catch. The two on-field umpires conferred over the validity of the catch, as it was unclear whether the ball had touched the ground prior to Silva flicking the ball up. Daryl Harper , standing at the bowler's end gave the decision that the wicket had been taken, but while walking off the field, Pietersen saw a replay on the big screen and questioned the validity of the decision. This led for calls for similar catches to be referred to the third (TV) umpire, but this can only take place if the on-field umpires have not made a decision. [158] Pietersen passed 3,000 Test runs during the series, becoming the fastest player (by time) to do so, [159] [160] He only averaged 25.20, and failed to score a half century in a series for the first time. [161]
Career in 2008[ edit ]
New Zealand tours (home and away)[ edit ]
See also: English cricket team in New Zealand in 2007–08 and New Zealand cricket team in England in 2008
On England's tour against New Zealand , Pietersen averaged 33.00 in the ODI series, with one score of 50 in the tied fourth match; England lost the series 3–1. [162] He also made a top score of 43 in the first of two comfortable Twenty20 matches. [163] Pietersen had a quiet first two Test matches, making little impression with the bat. He produced 42 and 6 as England collapsed in their second innings. In the next test, he fared little better making 31 and 17. However, in the first innings of the Napier Test he rescued England from a disastrous start of 4–3, guiding them to 259 with 129, his 11th Test century. [164]
New Zealand then came to tour England and Pietersen again struggled in the first two Test matches, scoring 3 in the first match. He improved slightly in the second but only making 26 in the first innings and then running himself out on 42 having looked well set. [165] He seemed to be struggling particularly against Daniel Vettori but he showed no signs of that as he struck a century in the third Test, forming a valuable partnership with Tim Ambrose , making a crucial 115. [166] Pietersen hit a winning 42 not out in the Twenty20 match.
Switch-hit[ edit ]
In the first ODI of the NatWest series, Pietersen hit two sixes by "switch-hitting" en route to 110 not out. While facing the bowling of medium pace Scott Styris , Pietersen turned his body around and switched hands (effectively batting as a left-hander) hitting two sixes over cover and long off. Because Pietersen not only reversed his hand position (as some batsman do while playing the reverse sweep ), but changed his stance by rotating his body, these "switch-hit" shots were immediately followed by calls to outlaw them from the game. [167] Although a similar shot was played when Pietersen reverse-swept Muttiah Muralitharan for six in Sri Lanka in 2006, in this case he switched hands and executed "the switch" before the ball was bowled. [168]
Several commentators complained that because Pietersen changed from being a right-handed to a left-handed batsman as the bowler approached his delivery stride, he was gaining an unfair advantage. Gideon Haigh said that "A bowler must advise a batsman when he's changing direction, why should the batsmen not; given that where the bowler's aiming will depend on the placement of the off stump". Ian Healy seconded this by saying "It just should be outlawed straightaway. If you want to hit to one side of the field, you've got to do it in a cross fashion, and not swap the way you're facing or your grip. Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups." Former fast-bowler Michael Holding argued "if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should he have to tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket." [169]
Pietersen countered these claims by saying:
"That's ridiculous, absolutely stupid. The reverse-sweep has been part of the game for however long. I am just fortunate that I am able to hit it a bit further. Everybody wants brand new ideas, new inventions and new shots. That is a new shot played today and people should be saying it's a new way to go. There are new things happening for cricket at the moment and people shouldn't be criticising it all the time." [170]
Another citation for the shot being outlawed was that the possibility of being out LBW ("a player is out LBW if...the ball pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the striker's wicket") is removed, as the off side become the leg side and vice versa. [171] The shots were considered by the MCC , governors of the game, who came to the conclusion that the shot was legal, believing that the LBW law (which continues "The off side of the striker's wicket shall be determined by the striker's stance at the moment the ball comes into play for that delivery") adequately covers the scenario. [172] [173] They cited the variations bowlers can make, such as bowling a googly or a slower ball, and also the inherent risk in the shot to the batsman, in the justification of their decision. [174]
There are still calls for further review of the stroke, with Jonathan Agnew giving a scenario in which a right-handed batsman can take his stance as a left-hander, then switch stance as the bowler runs in, thus being able to kick away any balls that land outside his now off stump. He also calls for the wide law to be adjusted in one-day cricket, as bowlers are penalised for most deliveries that pass down the leg side. [175]
England captaincy[ edit ]
Success against South Africa[ edit ]
Pietersen captained England in the fifth ODI against New Zealand after Paul Collingwood was banned for four games for a slow over-rate during the previous match. New Zealand won to finish theetersen was named as the stand-in captain for three further matches in August. [176]
Pietersen on his first day as England Test captain at The Oval in August 2008.
With Michael Vaughan as captain for the first three tests, Pietersen seemed to thrive in his first Test series against his former countrymen scoring 152 in the opening match of the series. During the third Test against South Africa, Pietersen was criticised for throwing his wicket away attempting a six to complete a century when on 94. Jonathan Agnew and Alec Stewart called the stroke "irresponsible" and Agnew continued, suggesting that Pietersen therefore ruled himself out of the potential reckoning for the England captaincy with Vaughan 's place in the starting line-up in doubt after failing to score runs. [177] In the event, having lost the match, Vaughan resigned and Pietersen was made the permanent captain of both the Test and ODI sides ( Paul Collingwood relinquished the ODI captaincy at the same time). [178]
Following the news that he had been made England Test and ODI captain, Pietersen paid tribute to both outgoing captains but announced that he would look to captain the team in his own style. [178] He scored a century in his debut match as captain in the dead rubber fourth Test, and went on to defeat South Africa 4–0 in the ODI matches. In that series he made 90 not out and got 2–22 with the ball. In the fourth ODI, another dead rubber as England were 3–0 up, he hit a quick 40 to guide England to victory.[ citation needed ]
Derailment against India[ edit ]
Pietersen continued to lead the team during a 5–0 defeat to India in ODI matches; the series was supposed to consist of seven matches, but was abandoned after the fifth due to the 2008 Mumbai attacks .[ citation needed ] Pietersen however had a decent series with the bat hitting a quick 63 in the first match and 111 not out in the fifth match. Pietersen's men returned to England before resuming the tour amid unprecedented security, to play a two-Test series. Pietersen was highly vocal in regards to the resumption of the tour, citing a need to stand up to terrorism. He had an aggregate of 5 runs in 2 innings in the first test being dismissed by Yuvraj Singh in the second innings which showed Pietersen's struggles against Yuvraj from the ODI series carried on. England were defeated in the first, however the team recovered to draw the second with Pietersen scoring 144. [179]
In January 2009, following England's losses in India, the media reported that Pietersen had asked the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to hold emergency meetings to discuss Moores' coaching role with the team. [180] Days later, Pietersen made remarks to the media about there being an 'unhealthy situation' that needed to be resolved in the England camp. The media speculated that Moores would shortly be replaced if there was a Pietersen–Moores rift. Moores and Pietersen were believed to be in disagreement on several issues, including the team's training regimen, and the possible selection of former England captain Michael Vaughan for the upcoming tour of the West Indies . [181] On 7 January 2009, Moores was removed as England's coach by the ECB, and Pietersen unexpectedly resigned as captain. [181] In the immediate aftermath of Pietersen's resignation, several commentators connected with English cricket indicated that they believed that Pietersen had miscalculated by openly advocating for the removal of Moores, particularly in making their dispute public. [182] In an interview several days after his resignation, Pietersen revealed that he had not intended to resign as captain, but was told by ECB officials that he was resigning. [183] Dennis Amiss , the vice-chairman of the ECB, went on record backing up Pietersen in his statement that the story of the rift with Moores had not been leaked to the media by him, saying, "We don't believe Kevin Pietersen leaked the information, we understand his frustration at it being leaked by other parties." [184] Pietersen was captain for three Test matches, and 10 One Day International matches. It was announced that Andrew Strauss would take over the captaincy. [8]
Career in 2009[ edit ]
England in West Indies[ edit ]
Pietersen's first match after resigning from the captaincy garnered much media attention, played in the Caribbean during England's tour of the West Indies under the new captain, Strauss. Though Pietersen scored 97 in the first innings of the first Test, West Indies had a lead of 74 and England were bowled out for 51 with Pietersen making only one being bowled by an out-swinger by Jerome Taylor as England collapsed to an innings defeat. After the second Test was abandoned, Pietersen made 51 in a quickly scheduled 'third' Test. His good form carried on as he scored 72 not out to give England the draw at Barbados. In the fifth and final Test, with England needing to win, Pietersen hit his quickest test century with 102 of 92 balls. He struggled in the one-day series that followed with his top score being 48.
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
In February 2009, Royal Challengers Bangalore of the Indian Premier League bought Pietersen for USD 1,550,000 which made him the highest-paid IPL player along with Andrew Flintoff . [185] The following month RCB owner Vijay Mallya announced that Pietersen would succeed Rahul Dravid as captain. He won two out of his six matches in charge before leaving to fulfil his international commitments with England; Anil Kumble took over the captaincy and led the Bangalore team to the IPL final. [186] Kevin Pietersen was later bought by Deccan Chargers for the 2011 season and was sold to Delhi Daredevils in the 2012 season without having played a single game for the Chargers.
West Indies and the World Twenty20[ edit ]
Pietersen began 2009 with questions over his form, where many pundits viewed him to be in a slump. [186] He was dismissed first ball in the first Test against the touring West Indies side dismissed by the full, swinging ball (a delivery which he seemed to struggle against), but in the second Test made a quick 49 before falling to an attacking shot. He then suffered what seemed only a minor right Achilles injury and was subsequently ruled out of the ODI series, which England also won. [187] In June 2009, Pietersen played in England's World Twenty20 warm-up match against Scotland , registering an unbeaten 53 in a six-wicket England victory. [188] He also appeared in the news after accidentally hitting a 15-year-old school boy with a cricket ball from a straight-drive after the boy had bowled to him. Pietersen left the boy, from Suffolk , with a signed bat as compensation. [189]
Pietersen's Achilles injury began flared up ahead of England's first Twenty20 match, against the Netherlands not long after. [190] In Pietersen's absence, England incurred a historic loss against the Dutch. [191] He returned for the second match against Pakistan and top scored with 58 of 38 balls and hit 3 sixes (one of which was measured at over 100m) in the 48 run victory, [192] he also top scored in the three run win over India later in the competition. [193] Despite missing the first match Pietersen ended the tournament as England's leading runscorer with 154 at an average of 38.50. [194]
2009 Ashes[ edit ]
Pietersen joined the England Ashes squad in June 2009 for the upcoming 2009 Ashes series. Despite failing to surpass single figure scores during a warm-up match against Warwickshire, [195] he helped England to a score over 400 on 8 July during the first day of the first Test at the SWALEC Stadium , Cardiff with 69 before being dismissed by Nathan Hauritz , top-edging a sweep to a ball outside off stump; the dismissal was heavily criticised. He also seemed to flare up his Achilles injury again suddenly which hampered his batting a bit. In the second innings he was bowled for 8 after leaving a straight ball from Ben Hilfenhaus . Many pundits thought the criticism of England's key batsman from the first innings possibly affected him. [196] In the first innings at Lords, after proving his fitness, he came at 222–2 and played some trademark shots before being caught behind off Peter Siddle . In the second innings he came in when England had a lead of almost 300 and he and Ravi Bopara batted for time. Pietersen limped when he ran and many shots ran off the inside edge which raised serious doubts for the rest of the series. He actually did well to reach 44 before being caught behind off Siddle again. After struggling in the field as England won, Pietersen was ruled out of the rest of the series with an Achilles injury. [197] This brought to an end 54 consecutive Test matches. As his recovery slowed, Pietersen was not included in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy and Andy Flower speculated that due to an infection of the wound Pietersen "may miss this winter's tour of South Africa because of slow progress in recovery from surgery." [198]
Career in 2010[ edit ]
Pietersen returned from injury in time to play a part in the 2009–10 winter tour of South Africa . His contributions, nevertheless, were significantly below his pre-injury range with an average of just 27. He showed several lapses of concentration, leading some to suggest that off-field distractions and lingering issues with his removal from the captaincy were still affecting his form. [199] Former England batsman and commentator Geoffrey Boycott detected a new technical fault of playing across full-length deliveries. [200]
Pietersen went into the two-match tour of Bangladesh on the back of poor performances on his return from injury and led to speculation Pietersen's England place was under pressure. [201] However, an important first innings of 99 in the first Test and a series clinching score of 74 not out in the second, during a stand of 167 not out with Alastair Cook , saw Pietersen return to much more respectable figures. England won the series 2–0 and Pietersen finished with total runs of 250 and an average for the series of 83.33. [202]
Pietersen joined up with his Royal Challengers Bangalore team following the conclusion to England's tour of Bangladesh . Pietersen showed further signs of a return to form in the IPL by scoring 236 runs with a high score of 66 * , with an average of 59.00, which was the highest in the IPL. [203]
2010 ICC World Twenty20[ edit ]
Pietersen was selected in England's 15-man squad for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in the West Indies . Pietersen's tournament got off to a poor start as he made was dismissed for duck by Rory Kleinveldt in a warm up match. [204] In England's first match against the West Indies , Pietersen started confidently scoring 24 from 20 balls before being dismissed on the pull by Darren Sammy . [205] Against Ireland , he struggled to get going, scoring a slow 9 from 18 balls. [206] In England's super eights match against Pakistan he scored 73 * from 52 balls, guiding England to a 6 wicket win. [207] In the following super eights match against South Africa , Pietersen scored an aggressive 53 runs from 33 balls, contributing to a 94 run partnership with Craig Kieswetter and a 39 run victory for England. For his performance, he was named man of the match. [208]
Following the conclusion of this match, Pietersen returned home to England to be present at the birth of his son. [209] Pietersen returned in time for England's semi-final against Sri Lanka , where he scored a vital 42* from 26 balls, guiding England home to a 7 wicket victory [210] and a place in their first ICC tournament final since the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy . In the final against old foes Australia , he scored 47 runs from 31 balls, which included 4 fours and 1 six. Pietersen shared in a vital stand of 111 with Kieswetter, before holing out to David Warner off the bowling of Steve Smith . Pietersen's knock was vital in helping England secure a 7 wicket victory and their first ever major ICC tournament victory. [211] After the match Pietersen was named man of the series for his vital contributions with the bat, which ended with Pietersen being the second highest run scorer with 248 runs at an average of 62.00 and a strike rate of 137.77. [212]
Bangladesh, Australia and Pakistan[ edit ]

Pietersen played in the Bangladesh home series, however contributed only 18 in the first innings before assisting England in chasing down a modest total with 10*. He made 64 in the second Test, however. [213] After the Test series, attention was drawn to Pietersen's lack of games for Hampshire – having not played a County Championship at the Rose Bowl since 2005. Having made one Twenty20 appearance for them against Surrey after the Bangladesh Test series, it was announced that he would be leaving Hampshire, stating that "Geographically it just doesn't work. I live in Chelsea." [5] On 22 June, Pietersen played his 100th ODI against Australia at his home ground, the Rose Bowl .[ citation needed ]
Pietersen bowled for 9 in the first Test v Pakistan at Trent Bridge July 2010
Pietersen struggled for form in an ODI series against Australia and then a Test series against Pakistan . England beat Australia 3–2, but Pietersen could only manage a top-score of 33. England beat Pakistan 3–1, and although Pietersen top-scored for England with 80 in the second Test, it was the only time he passed 50 and ended the series with a golden duck.[ citation needed ] His poor form, and an admission by Pietersen before the final Test that he was low on confidence, led to many in the media, including Geoffrey Boycott , to suggest that Pietersen could do with playing County Cricket to regain his form before the 2010–11 Ashes series .[ citation needed ]
Pietersen was omitted from both of England's limited-overs squads to face Pakistan. However, the ECB brokered a loan move to Surrey for the remainder of the 2010 English cricket season which enables him to play first-class cricket whilst the England side plays Pakistan in the limited overs leg of the tour.[ citation needed ] Pietersen announced the omission and loan-move to Surrey early through a Twitter message, which contained a swear-word and was quickly removed, and he apologised the following day. The online outburst drew some criticism of him, with national selector Geoff Miller one of those criticising the message. During the lead up to the 2010/11 Ashes Series Pietersen signed up for two first class games in the South African competition with the KwaZulu Natal Dolphins.[ citation needed ]
The Ashes down under[ edit ]
Pietersen went into the 2010–11 Ashes series without a century since March 2009, and many felt that England would be unable to retain the Ashes unless he found form. In the first Test at The Gabba , Brisbane , Pietersen hit 43 in the first innings but wasn't required in the second as England posted 517–1 declared before a draw was declared.[ citation needed ]
In the second Test in Adelaide , where he hit 158 on the previous Ashes tour, Pietersen joined opener Alastair Cook (148) to make a century partnership before going onto to score his 17th Test century. He finished with 227, a Test-best and his second Test double-century, as England declared on 620–5. Given a rare bowl at the end of the fourth day, Pietersen claimed the wicket of Michael Clarke (80) to leave Australia 238–4. England then proceeded to bowl Australia out in the final morning to win by an innings and 71 runs, and Pietersen was named man-of-the-match. [214]
2011 ODI Series against Australia[ edit ]
In the ODI series that followed the Ashes Test Series Pietersen's performance was solid in the first ODI at the MCG. His team high score of 78 helping England to post a traditionally competitive near 300 score. England were however defeated by the chasing Australians after Shane Watson 's monumental 161 not out. After making a first ball duck in the second ODI at Hobart Pietersen's fitness once again became an issue and he missed the third ODI due to a "groin strain". The fourth ODI, despite Pietersen making only 12 with the bat, was won by England. On 29 January Kevin announced to the media that England could make a miraculous comeback to win the series from 3–1 down. In the three remaining matches (all England defeats) Pietersen scored 40, 29 and 26 respectively. Australia won the seven match ODI series 6–1. [215]
Career in 2011[ edit ]
Pietersen batting during his innings of 72 against Sri Lanka at Lord's
Pietersen was part of England's 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup hosted by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka between February and March. In the warm-up matches he was asked to open the batting in anticipation that he would assume the position for the whole tournament. He had opened the batting just six times in one-day games and never for England, although had done so for England A in 2004. [216] Pietersen returned home early due to injury. A hernia required immediate surgery and the recovery time of around six weeks meant he would miss the rest of the tournament and potentially the IPL. Eoin Morgan took Pietersen's place in the squad. [217] Pietersen earned some criticism after being sighted at a nightclub in London while injured, however he dismissed the criticism as unwarranted. [218]
He returned from injury for the home series against Sri Lanka in May 2011. [218] Pietersen was also picked to play against India in July 2011, and scored 202 not out at Lord's in the 1st Test. During the innings, Pietersen passed 6,000 runs in Tests. [219] The feat took exactly six years, which is the fastest in terms of time taken, and 128 innings. [220] In the fourth Test he scored 175 runs and shared a partnership of 350 runs with Ian Bell. Pietersen was rested for the ODI series against that followed the Tests. [221]
Career in 2012[ edit ]
Sri Lanka and the IPL[ edit ]
Pietersen played a pivotal role in England's tour of Sri Lanka. By scoring a century in the second of two Tests, not only did he move to 20 centuries for England, but he levelled the series at 1–1, ensuring England retain their No.1 Test Ranking status. On 10 April, Pietersen started his first match in the 2012 Indian Premier League for his new team, the Delhi Daredevils . He scored his maiden century in that format during the tournament.
In May 2012, Pietersen was fined for a Twitter outburst against ex-England opener, Nick Knight . He commented "Can somebody please tell me how Knight has worked his way into the commentary box for Tests? Ridiculous" and despite attempts by Cook to "downplay" the incident, the ECB elected to uphold the fine. [222] It was Pietersen's second controversial use of the social media system following the incident in September 2010 where he announced his own dropping from the one-day team, for which he was also fined. [223]
Retirement from ODI and T20[ edit ]

On 31 May 2012, Pietersen announced his retirement from one-day international cricket. Although he intended to still play Twenty20s for England, and especially the World Twenty20 tournament in September 2012, the terms of his central contract meant that he had to retire from both forms. [224] [225] Remaining available for Test cricket only, Pietersen said that "with the intensity of the international schedule and the increasing demands on my body, I think it is the right time to step aside and let the next generation of players come through to gain experience for the World Cup in 2015." [226] This announcement came on the back of his 80 against the West Indies at Trent Bridge as England took an unassailable 2–0 lead in the three-Test series. [227] However, on 9 July 2012, Pietersen reversed his decision and suggested that he may return to ODIs in the future. [228]
South Africa in the summer of 2012[ edit ]
After the second Test against South Africa during the latter's tour of England in the summer of 2012, in which Pietersen scored his 21st Test century (149) and took Test-best bowling figures (3–52), Pietersen suggested that the third and final Test of that series might be his last. In the same press conference, he also mentioned issues within the dressing room that needed to be resolved. In the following days, allegations were made that he sent defamatory text messages to members of the South African dressing room, with Strauss and Flower said to be referred to within the messages.[ citation needed ]
Following talks with the ECB, however, Pietersen then unreservedly committed his future to all forms of cricket for England in a video interview posted on YouTube. [229] He was dropped for the third Test after failing to provide clarification about those messages, despite announcement of the squad being delayed to provide more time for him to do so. He was replaced by Jonny Bairstow . [12]
Reintegration and comeback[ edit ]
In October 2012, ECB confirmed that they had a process which could lead to Pietersen's return to the English cricket team. This led to Pietersen's selection as part of the Test squad later that month. [230] [231] He toured India with a successful Englan08, at 19:18.

Definitions[ edit ]
Each wicket consists of three stumps , upright wooden poles that are hammered into the ground, topped with two wooden crosspieces, known as the bails .
Most of the time, the wicket is one of the two sets of three stumps and two bails at either end of the pitch . [2] The wicket is guarded by a batsman who, with his bat , attempts to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket.
The origin of the word is from the standard definition of wicket as a small gate. Historically, cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate. The third (middle) stump was introduced in 1775.
The size and shape of the wicket has changed several times during the last 300 years and its dimensions and placing is now determined by Law 8 in the Laws of Cricket , thus:
Law 8: The wickets. The wicket consists of three wooden stumps that are 28 inches (71 cm) tall. The stumps are placed along the batting crease with equal distances between each stump. They are positioned so they are 9 inches (23 cm) wide. Two wooden bails are placed on top of the stumps. The bails must not project more than 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) above the stumps, and must, for men's cricket, be 4 5⁄
16
inches (10.95 cm) long. There are also specified lengths for the barrel and spigots of the bail. There are different specifications for the wickets and bails for junior cricket. The umpires may dispense with the bails if conditions are unfit (e.g., if it is windy they might fall off by themselves). Further details on the specifications of the wickets are contained in Appendix A to the laws.
Dismissing a batsman[ edit ]
Wicket also refers to the event of a batsman getting out. The batsman is said to have lost his wicket. If dismissed by a bowler , the bowler is said to have taken his wicket. The number of wickets taken is the primary measure of a bowler's ability.
For a batsman to be dismissed by being bowled , run out , stumped or hit wicket , his wicket needs to be put down. What this means is defined by Law 28 of the Laws of cricket . crickets wicket is put down if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or a stump is struck out of the grounds by the ball , the striker's bat, the striker's person (or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person), a fielder (with his hand or arm, and provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used). A 2010 amendment to the Laws clarified the rare circumstance where a bat breaks during the course of a shot and the detached debris breaks the wicket; the wicket has been put down in this circumstance. [3] The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner.
A ball from Bill O'Reilly hits the stumps but does not dislodge the bail , Sydney, 1932 . The wicket was not put down, and so the batsman ( Herbert Sutcliffe ) was not out .
If one bail is off, removing the remaining bail or striking or pulling any of the three stumps out of the ground is sufficient to put the wicket down. A fielder may remake the wicket, if necessary, in order to put it down to have an opportunity of running out a batsman.
If however both bails are off, a fielder must remove one of the three stumps out of the ground with the ball, or pull it out of the ground with a hand or arm, provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used.
If the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails, because, for example, it is too windy for the bails to remain on the stumps, the decision as to whether the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide. After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker's bat , person, or items of his clothing or equipment separated from his person as described above, or by a fielder with the hand holding the ball or with the arm of the hand holding the ball.
Partnership[ edit ]
The sequence of time over which two particular batsmen bat together, a partnership , is referred to as a specifically numbered wicket when discriminating it from other partnerships in the innings .
The first wicket partnership is from the start of the innings until one of the first two batsmen gets out.
The second wicket partnership is from when the third batsman gets in until a second batsman gets out.
etc...
The tenth wicket or last wicket partnership is from when the eleventh (last) batsman gets in until a tenth (last) batsman gets out.
Winning by number of wickets[ edit ]
A team can win a match by a certain number of wickets. This means that they were batting last, and reached the winning target with a certain number of batsmen still not dismissed. A team's innings ends when ten batsmen are dismissed, so, for example, if the side scored the required number of runs to win with only three batsmen dismissed, they are said to have won by seven wickets.
The pitch[ edit ]
The word wicket is also sometimes used to refer to the cricket pitch itself. According to the Laws of Cricket , this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers. This usage probably derives from the days when the outfield was kept short by grazing sheep on it and the playing surface, which was specially prepared, was protected from them by a light wicker fence around it. Since many regular grounds had resident bat-makers it is quite possible that the branches cut off from the willow wood used for the bats formed all or part of this fence.[ citation needed ]
The term sticky wicket refers to a situation in which the pitch has become damp, typically due to rain or high humidity. This makes the path of the ball more unpredictable thus making the job of defending the stumps that much more difficult. The full phrase is thought to have originally been "to bat on a sticky wicket." Such pitches were commonplace at all levels of the game (i.e. up to Test Match level) until the late 1950s.
In other sports[ edit ]
The arches used in croquet and roque are sometimes referred to as wickets, especially in American English . These arches descend from the ancestral game of ground billiards (which may also be related to cricket), and were formerly called the hoop, arch or port. The port remained a prominent feature of indoor table billiards until well into the 18th century. [4]

Personal life and early career[ edit ]
Rasool is from Ferozi Shah Mohalla Bijbehara in the Anantnag district of Kashmir. His coaches there were Abdul Qayoom who has played a good level Ranji cricket. Before playing junior cricket for Jammu and Kashmir, Rasool learnt the game from Qayoom and his own father, Ghulam Rasool, and brother, Asif Rasool, both have played competitive cricket. [4] [5] [6]
During 2009 CLT20 , Rasool was detained by the police in Bangalore in connection with a suspected presence of traces of explosives in his bag. He objected to the checking of his bag by sniffer dogs at his hotel. After questioning, the police learnt that his resistance was only due to his Quran and a prayer mat in the bag.
Rasool had come to Bangalore as a part of the Jammu & Kashmir Under-22 team playing in the CK Nayudu Trophy, and was staying at the KSCA's residential complex which was a few yards away from the Chinnaswamy Stadium . Rasool was released by the police after a few hours as no incriminating evidence was found.Four days after this disturbing incident, Parvez scored two brilliant half centuries against Mumbai team, one of those being 69 off just 47 deliveries in CK Naidu Trophy .
Domestic Career[ edit ]
In the 2012–13 Ranji season , Rasool scored 594 runs from 7 matches at an average of 54 including two centuries, and took 33 wickets at an average of 18 with three five-wicket hauls. n of India
Dhoni behind the stumps
Dhoni was named the captain of Indian squad for the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 held in South Africa in September 2007. [77] India were crowned champions as Dhoni led the team to victory against Pakistan in a thrilling contest. [78] He, then, went on to become the ODI captain of the Indian team for the seven-match ODI series against Australia in September 2007. [79] He made his debut as full-time Test captain of India during the fourth and final Test against Australia at Nagpur in November 2008 replacing Anil Kumble who was injured in the third test and who then announced his retirement. Dhoni was vice-captain in this series up to that point. [80] India eventually won that Test thus clinching the series 2–0 and retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . [81] Dhoni had previously captained India on a stand-in basis against South Africa and Australia in 2008 and 2009 respectively.
It was under his captaincy that India climbed to No. 1 in the ICC Test Rankings in December 2009. After that he managed to lead India in a series-leveling world championship of Tests against the South Africans in February 2010. India also managed to draw the Test series 1–1 in South Africa later that year.
After winning the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup final against Sri Lanka on 2 April 2011 with his match winning knock of unbeaten 91, Tendulkar heaped praises on Dhoni, claiming him to be the best captain he has played under. Tendulkar mentioned that it was Dhoni's calm influence that was rubbing off on all his team-mates and described Dhoni's handling of pressure was incredible.
Only nine players have captained ten or more Tests playing as a wicket-keeper. Dhoni leads the table with 33 Tests as captain, 15 ahead of Gerry Alexander in second place. [82]
In March 2013, Dhoni became the most successful Indian Test captain when he eclipsed Sourav Ganguly ’s record of 21 victories from 49 Tests. [83] Ganguly also said in an interview to a news channel that Dhoni is the all-time greatest captain of India and he has a great record to support this credential.
Match bans
Dhoni, being captain of the Indian cricket team, has seldom faced any restrictions not to play in matches, due to slow-over rate. In December 2009, he was suspended for two ODI matches against Sri Lanka when ICC match referee Jeff Crowe imposed the ban as India was three overs short of the specified overs. Hence Virender Sehwag was named the skipper for the two matches in Cuttack and Kolkata. [84] Further, in January 2012 he was banned for the fourth Test match against Australia in Adelaide . Dhoni's team was two overs short during the third Test in Perth . [85] Consequently, Sehwag captained the team in the Adelaide test and Wriddhiman Saha kept the wickets. In the CB Series in February, Dhoni again faced a one match ban for slow-over rate against Australia.[ citation needed ]
World Cup
Dhoni has captained India in two World Cups . Under his captaincy, India won the World Cup in 2011, and reached the semifinals in 2015.
2007 Cricket World Cup
Dhoni played his first ODI World Cup in 2007 at the Caribbean. India made an early exit from the tournament in the Group Stage. In 2007 Cricket World Cup , India was placed in Group B with Sri Lanka , Bangladesh and Bermuda . Rahul Dravid captained the team in this World Cup. In three matches India played, they managed to win only one against Bermuda while losing the rest from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In their first match against Bangladesh, India was all out in just 191 in 49.3 overs. Dhoni was out for 0.He stumped Tamim Iqbal , Shakib Al Hasan and captain Habibul Bashar in the match but, India lost by 5 wickets. In the next match against Bermuda, India posted the then Highest Score in the World Cup 413/5 in a must-win match. Dhoni scored 29 off 25 Balls which includes Two 4s and One 6. India won the match by 257 runs. India was required to win their last group match against the Lankans but they lost by 69 runs. Chasing the target of 255, India crumbled to 185 all out in 43.3 overs. Dhoni was out for 0 for the second time on the tournament in his very first ball by Muttiah Muralitharan . Thus, India was out of the world cup in very first round. The Team was heavily criticized for their performance. Dhoni's under construction house in Ranchi was attacked by some 200 fans after the Bangladesh loss.
2011 Cricket World Cup
Under Dhoni's captaincy, India won the 2011 World Cup . In the final against Sri Lanka, chasing 275, Dhoni promoted himself up the batting order, coming before Yuvraj Singh . When he came to bat India needed more than six runs per over with three top order batsmen already dismissed. He started building a good partnership with Gautam Gambhir . Due to good strokeplay and active running between wickets, they kept up with the required run rate. Dhoni was on 60 off 60 balls, but later accelerated with a greater flow of boundaries , ending with 91 not out off 79 balls. Befitting the occasion, he finished the match of in style with a huge six over long-on off bowler Nuwan Kulasekara and won Man of the Match. Later in the post match presentation, he admitted that he came up the order so as to counter the Muralitharan spin threat as he was very familiar with Murali's bowling, who was his team-mate in the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Chennai Super Kings . He had come after the dismissal of Virat Kohli , also a right-handed batsman. By partnering the left-handed Gambhir, he ensured a right-left combination at the crease that makes it difficult for bowlers to settle into a rhythm.
The bat used by Dhoni in the final match was sold for ₹ 72 Lac. The money goes to Sakshi Rawat Foundation, operated by Dhoni's wife Sakshi Rawat to help orphan children. [86]
2015 Cricket World Cup
For the 2015 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand , Dhoni was named the captain of the 30-member squad by the BCCI in December 2014. [87] Under his captaincy, India was able to go through to semi-finals with ease, beating Bangladesh in the quarter finals. However, they lost to Australia in the semi-finals. The team won 7 consecutive matches in this world cup and won 11 all consecutive in world cups. With the win against Bangladesh, he became the first non-Australian captain to won 100 ODI matches, and first Indian captain to achieve the mark. He is also the third captain to won 100 matches, after two Australians, Ricky Ponting , and Allan Border . [88]

Early years and personal life[ edit ]
Harbhajan was born into a Sikh family. He is the only son of Sardar Sardev Singh Plaha, a businessman who owned a ball bearing and valve factory. [7] [8] Growing up with five sisters, Harbhajan was in line to inherit the family business, but his father insisted that he concentrate on his cricket career and represent India. [8]
Harbhajan was trained as a batsman by his first coach Charanjit singh Bhullar, but converted to spin bowling after his coach's untimely death saw him turn to the tutelage of Davinder Arora. Arora credits Harbhajan's success to a work ethic that included a three-hour training session in the morning, followed by an afternoon session lasting from 3 pm until after sunset. [8]
Following the death of his father in 2000, Harbhajan became the family head, and by 2001 had organised marriages for three of his sisters. [7] In 2002 he ruled out his own marriage until at least 2008. [9] In 2005 he again fended off marriage rumours linking him to a Bangalore based bride, stating that he would only make a decision "after a couple of years", and that he would be seeking a Punjabi bride selected by his family. [10] [11] In a country where cricketers are idolised, Harbhajan's performances have brought him government accolades and lucrative sponsorships. Following his performance against Australia in 2001, the Government of Punjab awarded him Rs. 5 lakhs , a plot of land, and an offer to become a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Punjab Police, which he accepted.
Despite having a job with the constabulary, Harbhajan sustained minor injuries in March 2002 in an altercation with police outside the team hotel in Guwahati . The scuffle broke out when Harbhajan remonstrated with officers after they refused to allow a photographer into the hotel. Harbhajan cut his bowling arm and injured his elbow when he was struck by the police. Extensive negotiations from local officials and organisers were required to dissuade Harbhajan and captain Sourav Ganguly from leaving the area after Ganguly said that the Indian team would abandon the scheduled match against Zimbabwe . [12]
One of his common nicknames, outside India, is The Turbanator, deriving from his skill as a bowler in terminating the innings of the opposing team, and the fact that, as a Sikh , he wears a black turban whenever he plays. [13] Among Indians, Harbhajan is more commonly known as bhajji. [8] It was estimated in 2005 that Harbhajan was the most recognised and commercially viable Indian cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar , in part due to his colourful personality and iconic turban, as well as his reputation for enjoying the celebrity social scene. [14] His signing for English county team Surrey in 2005, based at The Oval in London, was partly attributed to his marketability. Harbhajan had generated a large personal following in the western London suburb of Southall , which boasts a majority Punjabi Sikh population, when he lived there in 1998 while training under Fred Titmus . [14]
In 2006 Harbhajan's endorsements generated controversy when he appeared without his turban in an advertisement for Royal Stag whisky . This angered many orthodox Sikhs, leading to anti-Harbhajan protests in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar , with effigies of Harbhajan being burnt. [15] The Sikh clergy and Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee demanded an apology from him and asked Seagram's to withdraw the advert, on the basis that it had "hurt the feelings of Sikhs". Harbhajan quickly issued an apology, but he was also unhappy at the clergy's interference, stating "If they were unhappy, they should have called me and talked to me like a son". [16]
Harbhajan Singh married his longtime girlfriend, actress Geeta Basra , on 29 October 2015 in Jalandhar. [17] [18]
Early career[ edit ]
Harbhajan broke into the Punjab Under-16s at the age of 15 years and 4 months in November of the 1995–96 season, and took 7/46 and 5/138 on debut against Haryana , setting up a nine-wicket win. He scored 56 in his next match against Delhi and then took 11/79 in his third match against Himachal Pradesh , orchestrating an innings win. He ended with 32 wickets at 15.15 and 96 runs at 48.00 in four matches. He was rewarded with selection for North Zone Under-16s, a team that represents all of northern India for a one-day series, in which he took two wickets at 43.50 in four matches and scored 18 runs. [19] At the end of the season, he was called into the national Under-19 team at the age of 15 years and 9 months for a youth One Day International against South Africa. He took 1/19 from seven overs in an Indian win. [19]
In 1996–97, Harbhajan was promoted to the Punjab Under-19s and he took 15 wickets at 20.20 in three matches, although he managed only two runs with the bat. This included match figures of 8/54 in an innings win over Jammu and Kashmir . [19]
Harbhajan made his first-class cricket debut in late 1997 against Services , during the 1997–98 Ranji Trophy season. He took a total of 3/35 in an innings win but was dropped back to the Under-19s the following week. He then took 5/75 and 7/44 in two matches to earn a recall to the senior team. He then took a total of 7/123 in the next two matches for Punjab to earn selection for North Zone in the Duleep Trophy . [19]
Harbhajan's season was interrupted when he represented India at the Under-19 World Cup in January 1998. He played in six matches, taking eight wickets at 24.75 with a best of 3/5 against Kenya . [19]
Returning to India he played in three more Ranji Trophy matches, and from a total of six matches, he took 18 wickets at an average of 22.50, ranking outside the top 20 in wicket taking. [20] He took a total of 5/131 as North lost to East Zone by five wickets. [21]
Despite the superior statistics of other bowlers in domestic cricket, Harbhajan was the selected for the Indian Board President's XI to play the touring Australian cricket team ahead of the Tests. He managed only 1/127, [19] and was ignored for the first two Tests before being selected to make his Test debut in the Third Test against Australia in Bangalore , where he scored 4 not out and a duck, and recorded the modest match figures of 2/136 as Australia won the match by eight wickets. [22] He was subsequently overlooked for the triangular ODI tournament in India that followed the Tests, involving Zimbabwe in addition to Australia, but was selected for all group matches in the triangular tournament that followed soon after in Sharjah , where he made his ODI debut against New Zealand . [23] He took 1/32 from ten overs on debut as India narrowly won by 15 runs. He then took 3/41 in the next match, a defeat against Australia, but then struggled in the second qualifying match against the same team, taking 1/63 in eight overs. He was subsequently dropped for the final against Australia, which India won, and ended the series with five wickets at 33.20 at an economy rate of 4.36. [19]
Harbhajan was fined and given a suspended ban for one ODI by the match referee in his first international series, when his on-field behaviour was adjudged to breach the ICC Code of Conduct . The incident in question was his altercation with Ricky Ponting after dismissing him. [7] [24]
Harbhajan was then omitted from the team during a home triangular ODI tournament against Bangladesh and Kenya , after taking 0/18 from four overs in his only match of the tournament against the former opponent, [19] but was recalled for the Singer Trophy in Sri Lanka and also involving New Zealand. Playing in all five matches, Harbhajan claimed eight wickets at an average of 24.12 and economy of 4.38 in this tournament, taking at least one scalp in each match. Harbhajan was retained for the final and took 1/57, his worst return for the series, in an Indian win. After being omitted for the Sahara Cup series against Pakistan in Toronto, Harbhajan played in a weakened Indian team at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia. The matches were not given ODI status by the ICC, and India chose to send their better players to the Sahara Cup instead. India won their first two matches against Antigua and Canada , but Harbhajan managed only a total of 1/48 from 11 overs. The Indians then needed to beat a full-strength Australian outfit to win their group and progress to the semi-finals. Harbhajan was punished and went wicketless, conceding 50 runs in eight overs as Australia won by 146 runs, knocking India out of contention. [19]
Harbhajan was then recalled to the first-choice team and took five wickets at an average of 22.60 at 3.89 runs an over from three matches on a tour to Zimbabwe , in what would prove to be his last ODI appearances for India for more than two years. [25] In all, he took 18 ODI wickets at an average of 27.2 during the 1998. [26]
After taking 2/38 and 3/60 in an innings win in a tour match, Harbhajan was retained in the Test team, taking 2/42 and 3/63 in the only Test on the Zimbabwe tour. He was unbeaten on 15 in the second innings as the final wicket fell and India succumbed to a 51-run defeat. [19]
Returning to India, Harbhajan started the 1998–99 domestic season well, taking 3/54 and 5/39 in an innings win over Services, before following up with 6/69 and 1/93 in the next match against Delhi, claiming his first five-wicket innings haul. He then took 6/63 and scored 31 in the first innings of a match for the Board PResident's XI against a touring West Indies A, and was taken on the tour of New Zealand in December. In a tour match against Central Districts , Harbhajan struggled, aggregating 2/112. He only played in one Test during the tour, and went wicketless, conceding 72 runs. [19] Upon returning to India, he took a total of 3/158 for India A in a match against the touring Pakistanis ahead of the Tests. After being omitted for the First Test lost in Chennai , he was recalled for the latter two matches against Pakistan, and took five wickets at 34.60 as the matches were split. [19] He then took 3/127 in a high-scoring draw against Sri Lanka. [27] [28] In all, he claimed 13 wickets at an average of 36.8 in five Tests for the season. [29] When he was free of international fixtures for the season, he played in the Ranji Trophy matches, claiming 27 wickets at an average of 24.59 in five matches, including his first five-wicket haul at first-class level. [30] He also registered his maiden first-class fifty, scoring an unbeaten 67 against Tamil Nadu cricket team .
Harbhajan took four wickets at 33.00 during the one-dayers during the season and was overlooked for the ODI team for the whole season and missed selection for the 1999 Cricket World Cup . [23] [31] In September 2003, he played for India A in a one-day series against their Australian counterparts in Los Angeles. Harbhajan took eight wickets at 17.00 at 3.77 runs an over in the five matches, with a best of 3/38. [19]
After taking 4/91 against the touring team for the Board President's XI at the start of the season, Harbhajan managed to retain his Test position for the late 1999 home series against New Zealand , as India fielded a three-pronged spin attack on dusty tracks, taking six wickets at an average of 32.66 as the hosts prevailed 1–0 in the two Tests. [19] [32]
International exile[ edit ]
After taking eight wickets in his next two Ranji matches, Harbhajan was selected to tour Australia in 1999–2000 , as the second spinner. He did not play in the Tests, with India opting to field only Anil Kumble in the team. [33] [34] Australia whitewashed India 3–0, and Harbhajan struggled in his only first-class outing against Tasmania , taking 0/141, a portent of future unsuccessful tours to Australia. [19]
Harbhajan was not part of the ODI squad for the Australian tour and upon returning to India in early-2000 needed strong first-class results to maintain his Test position. He went wicketless against Hyderabad, and was selected for the Board President's XI match against the touring South Africans. He took 2/88 and 2/59 and scored 38 and 39 to prevent the hosts being bowled out and defeated, but was dropped as the second slow bowler, as Murali Kartik became Kumble's spinning partner. [35] Harbhajan returned to domestic action, taking 24 wickets in Punjab's remaining four first-class matches. [19] He ended the Indian season with 46 first-class wickets at 26.23. [19]
In mid-2000 an opportunity arose when Harbhajan was selected in the first group of trainees sent to the National Cricket Academy to study under Erapalli Prasanna and Srinivas Venkataraghavan , two off spin bowlers from the Indian spin quartet of the 1970s. However, his behaviour did not conform to requirements, and he was expelled on disciplinary grounds. [7] [36] His sponsorship job with Indian Airlines was also reviewed as a result of his indiscipline. [7] [37] Harbhajan later admitted that he had been at fault earlier in his career. [38]
Following his run-ins with Indian cricket administrators, there was nothing to indicate that Harbhajan's chances of national selection had improved at the start of 2000–01. Despite Kumble being injured, Harbhajan was again overlooked as Kartik, Sunil Joshi , and debutant Sarandeep Singh were entrusted with the spin bowling duties in Test matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe on the subcontinent. [39] [40] Having made little success in this phase of his international career, averaging 37.75 per Test wicket to date, and overlooked by selectors, Harbhajan faced a difficult decision. [29] His father had recently died; as the family's only son, Harbhajan was now obliged to support his mother and unmarried sisters. He contemplated quitting cricket and moving to the United States to drive trucks for a living. [41] After being out of the team for more than 12 months, there was little overt indication of the sudden rise that would occur in his cricketing career only a few months later. [7]
During the first half of the season, still in international exile, Harbhajan continued to pick up wickets on the domestic circuit. In five Ranji Trophy matches, he claimed 28 wickets at 13.96. He claimed 3/29 and 3/39 against Himachal Pradesh, 2/53 and 5/88 against Jammu and Kashmir, 4/77 and 2/33 against Haryana and 5/40 against Services in the first four matches, all of which ended in innings wins for Punjab. He then took a total of 4/32 in a 199-run win over Delhi. Harbhajan's batting, which had rarely been productive up to this point in his career, also improved. He scored a career-best 84 against Haryana and added 52 against Services, aggregating 207 runs at 51.75. [19] After taking eight wickets at 21.12 in six one-dayers, Harbhajan was selected for North in the Duleep Trophy, but his early-season form deserted him. He took five wickets at 39.00 in two matches, although he did continue his productive run with the bat, scoring 130 runs at 32.50 with three scores above 35. [19]
2001 Border-Gavaskar Trophy[ edit ]
Harbhajan bowling in the nets.
With Kumble injured before the home series in March 2001 against the visiting Australians, [42] Harbhajan, whose previous best Test figures were only 3/30, [27] was the only capped spinner in the Indian team for the First Test. [43] He had been recalled after captain Sourav Ganguly publicly called for his inclusion in the team. He was to lead the spin attack against an Australian team which had set a world record with 15 consecutive Test victories, and was searching for its first ever series victory on Indian soil since 1969 . [42] [44] In a warm-up match for India A, Harbhajan had taken 2/63 and 3/81 against the tourists. [19] Harbhajan started well in the First Test in Mumbai , taking three quick wickets in a spell of 3/8, to reduce Australia to 99/5 in response to India's first innings of 176. However, a counter-attacking 197- run partnership between Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist in just 32 overs , saw Harbhajan concede 103 runs from his last 17 overs, to end with 4/121. Despite being struck for many sixes into the crowd, it was still Harbhajan's best statistical analysis at Test level, as Australia proceeded to a crushing 10-wicket victory, their sixteenth consecutive Test victory in succession. [43] [45] [46]
With leading paceman Javagal Srinath ruled out of the series with a finger injury during the First Test, [47] the teams met for the Second Test in Kolkata , with an even bigger burden on Harbhajan. Public opinion was sceptical about India's chances of stopping Australia's winning streak, with former captain Bishan Bedi lamenting the demise of Indian cricket. [48] Australia were again in control on the first day, having scored 193/1, with Hayden having struck Harbhajan out of the attack. Harbhajan fought back to reduce Australia to 252/7, taking five wickets in the final session, including Ricky Ponting , Gilchrist and Shane Warne in successive balls to become the first Indian to claim a Test hat-trick . [45] After a prolonged wait for the third umpire to adjudicate whether Sadagoppan Ramesh had managed to catch Warne before the ball hit the ground, the near-capacity crowd at Eden Gardens erupted when he was given out. [49] Harbhajan eventually finished with 7/123 as Australia were bowled out for 445. India batted poorly and were forced to follow-on , but a 376-run partnership between V. V. S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid , who batted together for an entire day, allowed India to set Australia an imposing target of 384 to win on the final day. Australia appeared to be safely batting out the match for a draw, until losing 7/56 in the final session, collapsing from 166/3 to be bowled out for 212. Harbhajan claimed four of the wickets, to finish with 6/73 for the innings and a match tally of 13/196. India ended Australia's 16-match world record winning streak, and became only the third team to win a Test after being forced to follow on (Australia having lost all three of those matches). [45] [50] [51] [52]
The teams arrived in Chennai for the deciding Third Test, and Australia's batsmen again seized control after winning the toss, reaching 340/3 on the second morning. Then, Australian captain Steve Waugh padded away a delivery from Harbhajan. The ball spun back into Waugh's stumps, who pushed the ball away with his glove, becoming only the sixth batsman in Tests to be given out " handled the ball ". [53] Waugh's dismissal instigated another Australian batting collapse, losing 6 wickets for 51 runs to be bowled out for 391, with Harbhajan taking all six in a spell of 6/26, to finish with 7/133. [54] After India's batsmen gained a first-innings lead of 110, the Australian batsmen were again unable to cope with Harbhajan in the second innings, who took 8/84 to end with match figures of 15/217. India appeared to be heading for an easy victory at 101/2 chasing 155, before losing 6/50 to be 151/8. Harbhajan walked to the crease, and struck the winning runs. [46] [55]
He was named man of the match and man of the series , having taken 32 wickets at 17.03 for the series, [28] [45] when none of his team-mates managed more than three. [56] [57] The Wisden 100 study conducted by Wisden in 2002 rated all four of Harbhajan's efforts in the Second and Third Tests in the top 100 bowling performances of all time, the most for any bowler. [58] He paid tribute to his father, who had died just six months earlier. [12] [59] His performance led to him usurping Anil Kumble 's position as India's first-choice spinner. [45]
Later career[ edit ]
Harbhajan is considered to be one of the legends in Indian cricket. Harbhajan's Test success saw him recalled to the ODI team after more than two years. He was unable to reproduce his Test form against Australia, managing only four wickets at an average of 59.25 and economy rate of 5.04. His best performance was a 3/37 in a 118-run win in the third match, and a cameo batting performance of 46 runs from 34 balls, including three sixes, in a losing run chase in the fourth fixture. He was dropped from the ODI team during a subsequent triangular tournament in Zimbabwe in 2001 after only managing two wickets at 69.00 in four matches although he had been economical at 3.63 runs an over. [25] Harbhajan was also unable to maintain his form in the Test series against Zimbabwe . Harbhajan began the tour well with 13 wickets in two warm-up matches, including a match haul of 10/80 against the CFX Academy, but could not repeat such performances in the Tests. He took eight wickets at 29.12 in the two-Test series, which was drawn 1–1, but did manage to post his first Test half-century, reaching 66 in the First Test in Bulawayo , before scoring 31 in the first innings of the Second Test as the Indian batsmen struggled and ceded their series lead. [28] The Indians subsequently toured Sri Lanka in mid-2001, enjoying spinning wickets similar to those in India. Harbhajan managed to establish himself in the ODI team with eleven wickets at 21.18 at the low economy rate of 3.42 in seven matches in the ODI tournament with the hosts and New Zealand. Ironically however, his best performances, in which he conceded less than 30 runs in his ten overs three times, all ended in Indian defeats. [19] In contrast to his ODI improvement, Harbhajan's Test form deteriorated further, yielding only four wickets at 73.00 in three Tests, while Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was named man of the series with 23 wickets, in what was billed as a contest between the world's two leading off-spinners. [7] With the Tests locked at 1–1 Harbhajan managed only 2/185 in the Third Test as the hosts accumulated 6/610 declared and won by an innings. He scored 79 runs at 15.80 for the series. [19]
Harbhajan is considered to be one of the legends in Indian cricket.
Harbhajan was omitted from the Indian team in favour of Kumble as the first-choice spinner on the following tour of South Africa , only playing in the later matches when India fielded two spinners. Nevertheless, Harbhajan continued to do well in the ODIs, taking nine wickets at 20.44 in six matches at an economy rate of 3.53, winning his first man of the match award in the ODI form in an ODI against South Africa in Bloemfontein after taking 3/27 from his ten overs. [25] [28] He scored 62 runs at 15.50, including a rearguard 37 that was not enough to prevent an embarrassing 70-run loss to Kenya. [19] After being omitted for the First Test, which India lost, his disciplinary problems continued when he was one of four Indian players fined and given a suspended one match suspension for dissent and attempting to intimidate the umpire by over-appealing in the Second Test. [60] India managed to draw the match, but Harbhajan struggled and took 1/89 and 2/79. The off spinner continued his poor overseas Test form in what would have been the Third Test. However, India defied the ICC by playing banned batsman Virender Sehwag , while Mike Denness , the match referee who handed down the penalties, was locked out of the stadium, so the match was stripped of Test status. Harbhajan continued to be ineffective, taking only 1/104, although he showed resistance with the bat, scoring 29 and 30 when many specialist batsmen failed, as India slumped to an innings defeat. [19]
Harbhajan's Test fortunes improved immediately upon the start of the 2001–02 international season in India. Playing in his first international match at his home ground in Mohali , Punjab , Harbhajan took match figures of 7/110, including 5/51 in the first innings, to help India win the First Test by ten wickets against the touring English team . He continued his steady form throughout the series with another five wicket haul in the Second Test in Ahmedabad , to end with thirteen wickets at 24.53 for the series, although he went wicketless in 27.1 overs in the Third and final Test. [27] Harbhajan's good home form persisted in the Test matches against Zimbabwe , taking twelve wickets at 19.66 in two games. [28] In the First Test, he took 4/46 in the second innings to seal an innings victory after going wicketless in the second innings. His 2/70 and 6/62 in the Second Test in Delhi saw him named man of the match in a Test for the second time in his career. [61] As in the first instance, he hit the winning runs, a straight-driven six, after India had lost six wickets and threatened to collapse in pursuit of a modest 122 for victory. [62] He also performed strongly in the ODIs during the Indian season, taking twenty wickets at 19.75 in ten matches and taking his first five wicket haul in ODIs. [25] In the five matches against England, he took ten wickets at 20.10 at an economy rate of 4.27. His best result was a 5/43 in the last of these matches, but a late collapse handed the tourists a five-run win. [19] He did better against the Zimbabweans, taking 10 wickets in five matches at an average of 19.40 and an economy rate of 4.06. This included a 4/33 in the final match. He also scored 39 runs without defeat for the series, including a 24 not out as India were skittled for 191 in one match. [19] As Harbhajan was ensconced in the Indian team for the first team, he only played in two RAnji Trophy matches for Punjab, taking 13 wickets at 20.01 and scoring 71 runs at 17.75. [19]
Harbhajan's overseas difficulties returned during the tour of the West Indies in mid-2002. He injured his shoulder while fielding in a tour match in which he started well with a total of 5/70, [19] and was forced to miss the First Test in Guyana . [63] After taking only six wickets at 38 upon his return to the team for the Second and Third Tests, he was dropped for the Fourth Test, but was recalled again for the Fifth Test at Sabina Park , after Kumble was injured. [64] Despite taking improved match figures of 8/180, including 5/138 in the first innings, Harbhajan was unable to prevent an Indian defeat after the batting collapsed in the first innings. [27] He claimed three wickets in the three match ODI series at 33.00, conceding 4.71 runs per over. [25]
Despite his performance at Sabina Park, Harbhajan was dropped again when Kumble returned for the First Test on the tour to England at Lord's , where the hosts prevailed. India's coach John Wright later admitted that Harbhajan's omission had been a mistake. [65] Harbhajan returned for the final three Tests with moderate success, taking 12 wickets at 34.16, improving as the English summer wore on. After claiming 3/175 in the drawn Second Test, he struck form in the tour match against Essex , taking 7/83 and 1/23. He then took 3/40 and 1/56 as India levelled the series in the Third Test at Headingley, before taking 5/115 in the first innings of the Fourth Test at The Oval , as well as managing his second Test half-century of 54 at Trent Bridge in the Second Test. [28] He ended the series with 90 runs at 22.50. for the entire tour, Harbhajan aggregated 28 wickets at 27.60. [19] Harbhajan had modest results in the Natwest Trophy. After being dropped after one wicketless match, he was dropped and then took 4/46 against Sri Lanka in the last match before the final to ensure his retention, but went wicketless in the decider, which India won. He played in three ODIs and took four wickets at 37.25 at 4.96. [19]
The 2002 ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka at the end of the tour brought moderate results with six wickets at 30.66 at an economy rate of only 3.68, [28] and a best of 3/27 from ten overs in the firstwashed out final against the host nation. [25] Harbhajan helped restrict Sri Lanka to 5/244, but rain ended proceedings with India at 0/14. He then took 1/34 the next day during a replay of the final. This time the hosts made 7/222 and a downpour again thwarted the players, with India at 1/38 when play was called off and the trophy shared. [19]
As was the case in the previous season, Harbhajan's return to Indian soil coincided with an improvement in results. He took 1/37 and 7/48 in an innings victory at Mumbai in the First Test against the West Indies , and then contributed match figures of 3/56, 4/79 and 37 in an eight-wicket victory in Chennai which saw him named man of the match. [61] A haul of 5/115 in the Third Test at Calcutta was the best in a high scoring match, and with 20 wickets at 16.75 and 69 runs at 17.25, Harbhajan was named as the man of the series . [57] He was unable to transfer his performances to the ODI format, taking only five wickets at 49.00 against the same team at an economy rate of 5.44. [25] Harbhajan took only five wickets at 18.80 in the subsequent Test tour to New Zealand, in a series where five pace bowlers averaged less than 20 on green, seaming tracks. [66] [67] India lost the series 2–0 and Harbhajan's 20 and 18 in the Second Test amounted for more than 15% of India's match total. [19] The off spinner then took 1/56 in one ODI before heading for his World Cup debut in South Africa.
Harbhajan had a mixed tournament at the 2003 Cricket World Cup , taking 11 wickets at 30.45 with an economy rate of 3.92 in ten matches. He was the first-choice spinner and played in all matches but one, being dropped for the victory against arch-rivals Pakistan in the group phase. His counterpart, Kumble, played in only three matches. [23] [68] Harbhajan was steady throughout the tournament, never taking more than two wickets in a match, and never conceding more than 42 runs from his quota of ten overs, except in the two matches against Australia, who went through the tournament without defeat. In the group match, Harbhajan was the second highest score, with a counterattacking 28 as India collapsed for 125, but when it was his turn to bowl, the Australians attacked him and scored 49 runs from his 44 balls without losing a wicket in a decisive nine-wicket win. In the final, Ganguly elected to field and Harbhajan was the only Indian bowler to take a wicket, taking 2/49 from eight overs. In contrast, the Australians scored at 7.38 runs per over from the other bowlers to reach 2/359, the highest total in a World Cup final, and win by 125 runs. [23] He was the fourth leading wicket taker for India overall and his tournament bowling average was worse than those of Zaheer Khan , Ashish Nehra and Javagal Srinath . [69] He finished the season with six wickets at 14.00 at 3.65 runs per over in three matches in an ODI tournament in Bangladesh , where he was fined for abusing an umpire. [23] [70]
Finger injury[ edit ]
After experiencing pains in his spinning finger during the World Cup, Harbhajan was scheduled to undergo surgery in mid-2003 in Australia, [71] [72] but the surgery was delayed as he sought to play through the pain. [73] He underwent physiotherapy in lieu of surgery and was declared fit for a two-match Test series at home against New Zealand in late-2003. [74] His performance was substantially worse than his previous displays on Indian soil, taking only six wickets at an average of 50.00 as both matches ended in high-scoring draws. Aside from his debut series, it was his worst series bowling average on Indian soil. [28] Despite a triangular ODI series against New Zealand and Australia in which he managed only four wickets at 40.50 in four matches and spent time in the sidelines, the Indian team attempted to manage his injury rather than have his finger operated on, and took him on the 2003–04 tour of Australia . As with his previous visit four years earlier, Harbhajan had an unhappy time, taking 2/159 in a tour match against Victoria . [19] After an ineffective 1/169 in the First Test at Brisbane , his injury deteriorated and he underwent major finger surgery, sidelining him for a predicted five months. [75] [76] [77] Kumble replaced him and took 24 wickets in the remaining three Tests in strak contrast of Harbhajan's struggles in Australia. Kumble bowled India to victory in the following Test against Pakistan in Multan , taking 6/71 to reclaim his position as the No. 1 spinner. [78]
After a seven-month layoff, Harbhajan returned to represent India in ODIs in the Asia Cup in July 2004, where he took four wickets at 39.75 in four matches at 3.97 runs per over. His performance improved on the tour to England for an ODI series against England and the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy , taking eight wickets at 14.00, conceding only 2.80 runs an over, including 3/28 against England and 3/33 against Kenya and hitting as an unbeaten 41 against England at The Oval as India's batting collapsed to a substantial defeat. [23] [25]
Harbhajan made his Test return against Australia, who were again seeking their first series win on Indian soil since 1969 in the late 2004 home series . [79] Harbhajan took 5/146 in the first innings and 6/78 in the second innings in addition to making a run out to reduce Australia from 103/3 to 228 all out. Despite this, India required 457 in their second innings to win, slumping to 125/8 before Harbhajan (42) and Irfan Pathan helped India to reach 239 after a rearguard counterattack, still a 217-run loss. [80] Harbhajan was less effective in the drawn Second Test in Chennai , with match figures of 5/198, which was washed out with India still needing 210 more runs on the last day with all ten wickets in hand. [19] Harbhajan then withdrew from the Third Test in Nagpur due to illness. [81] Australia won the match easily, clinching the series. [79] Harbhajan returned for the final Test in Mumbai. After failing to take a wicket in the first innings, he claimed 5/29 in the second to help India bowl Australia out for 93 and claim a dramatic 14-run victory. [82] Harbhajan ended the series with 21 wickets at 24.00 and 69 runs at 13.80. [28]
A Test series in India against South Africa followed, with Harbhajan taking match figures of 4/166 in the drawn First Test in Kanpur , before producing a man of the match performance in the Second Test in Calcutta to lead India to a 1–0 series win. After taking 2/54 in the first innings, he took 6/78 in the second, including South Africa's first five batsman to help dismiss the tourists for 222. This set up a run-chase of 117, which India reached with eight wickets in hand. [83] Harbhajan was the leading wicket-taker for the series, with 13 victims at an average of 23.61. [84] He ended 2004 with a quiet tour of Bangladesh , scoring a 47 in the Second Test and taking four wickets at 41.75 in two Tests and one wicket at 94 at an economy rate of 5.22 in two ODIs. [25] [28] He had a relatively light workload, bowling only 47.4 overs in the Tests, as Irfan Pathan frequently scythed through the Bangladeshi batsmen with the new ball, taking three five wicket hauls. [85] He then returned to India and took a total of 6/172 in North Zone's seven-wicket win over South. [19]
His performance in Bangladesh saw him dropped for the First Test in the early 2005 series against Pakistan on his home ground in Mohali , with Kumble being the only spinner selected on the pace-friendly surface. [86] India were in control of the match for four days, and needed only four wickets on day five, but were unable to break the Pakistani lower-order until play was almost over and the tourists had taken a lead, and the match ended in a draw. Harbhajan was recalled for the Second Test in Calcutta and took match figures of 4/145 in an Indian victory. Despite taking 6/152 in a marathon 51-over spell in the first innings of the Third Test in Bangalore , Pakistan won the match to level the series after India collapsed on the final day. Harbhajan finished the series with 10 wickets at 33.20. [27] [28] His performance in the subsequent ODI series was even worse, managing only three wickets at 73.66 in five matches at an economy rate of 4.80. [25] In spite of the poor end to the season, his performance in the year since finger surgery in the long form of the game saw him nominated for the 2005 ICC Test Player of the Year. [87] Harbhajan spent the international off-season playing for Surrey in English county cricket, citing the improvement that other international players had gained from such an experience. It was his first stint in county cricket, after a planned season at Lancashire in 2003 was cancelled due to injury. [88] After taking six wickets in his opening two first-class fixtures, he struck form against Hampshire , taking 6/36 and 2/47 in an innings triumph. In is fourth and final first-class match, against Gloucestershire , Harbhajan took a total of 6/193 and equalled his previous first-class best of 84. He ended with 20 wickets at 25.85 and 124 runs at 31.00. [19] In the Twenty20 competition, he had less success in the new format, taking four wickets at 38.00 at an economy rate of 6.60 in eight matches. In all he spent six weeks with the county. [19]
Chappell era[ edit ]
Harbhajan's first outings under newly appointed coach Greg Chappell came at the Indian Oil Cup in Sri Lanka in August 2005. He took five wickets at 31.40, conceding 4.02 runs per over in four matches, but was wicketless in the final, which was won by the host nation. [23] This was followed by a tour of Zimbabwe, which was marred by tension between the new coach and Indian captain Ganguly. This broke into the public arena when Ganguly claimed that he was asked to resign as captain. [89] Harbhajan played in all five matches in the Videocon Tri-Series involving Zimbabwe and New Zealand with little success, managing only two wickets at 99.00 at an economy rate of 4.77, [23] both of them against an inexperienced Zimbabwe team crippled by a mass exodus of white players from the Mugabe regime. Harbhajan had a quiet Test series against Zimbabwe, taking six wickets at 31.00. [28] He was only required to bowl 58 overs, [27] as the majority of the Zimbabwean batsmen were removed after being unable to cope with Pathan's swing which was likened to "Frisbees at high speed", leaving little work for the spinners. [90] He managed to claim his 200th Test wicket in the First Test, and in doing so became the second youngest player to reach the mark after Kapil Dev . [90] Harbhajan's batting was notable for an exceptionally aggressive 18-ball innings in the First Test in Bulawayo, where he struck four fours and three sixes in a cameo innings of 37. [91]
Harbhajan's difficulties were compounded when he earned the ire of cricket authorities by publicly attacking Chappell and defending Ganguly after the team returned to India. [92] He claimed that Chappell had used "double standards" and instilled "fear and insecurity" into the team. The Punjab Cricket Association called him to explain his actions, [93] but he was not punished after offering an apology. [94] In early 2006, Harbhajan changed his stance publicly, praising Chappell for the team's improved form, stating "He has great knowledge about the game and it has been a very successful year for us under him. He has lifted our team to great heights". [95]
Harbhajan was under pressure to perform when Sri Lanka toured India in late 2005 following his attack on Chappell and the replacement of Ganguly, who had frequently supported him during previous career difficulties, with new captain Rahul Dravid . In addition, his home ODI form had been poor in the previous three years, managing only 12 wickets at 56 in 16 matches, with an economy rate of 4.8. [96] In the three Challenger Trophy matches at the start of the season, he took five wickets at 24.20 at an eeconomy rate of 4.25. [19] He responded by claiming 3/35 in the first ODI in Nagpur after Sri Lanka had raced to 50 in just 6.3 overs. The Sri Lankan batsmen hit the Indian fast bowlers out of the attack, scoring 74 runs in the first 10 overs and forcing Dravid to delay the Power Play and introduce Harbhajan. This sparked a collapse, with 4 wickets taken for 14 runs, resulting in a 152-run Indian victory. [97] Harbhajan took 2/19 in the next match, [19] and aggregated six wickets at 26 in the first four matches, at a low economy rate of 3.43, with a series of performances noted for skilful variations in pace and flight, helping India gain an unassailable 4–0 series lead. [23] [96] He was subsequently rested for the fifth ODI, and ended the series as the most economical bowler, conceding only 3.62 runs per over. [98]
He put on another strong personal performance in the first ODI of the following series against South Africa in Hyderabad , where he struck an aggressive unbeaten 37 from 17 balls, including two sixes, to help India recover to 249/9, before taking 1/35 from his 10 overs. [99] He was unable to prevent an Indian loss, and was fined after pointing Ashwell Prince to the pavilion after dismissing him. [100] [101] Harbhajan ended the series with five wickets at 27.40, [25] and was again India's most economical bowler, conceding 3.92 runs per over. [102]
The year ended with a three Test series against Sri Lanka. After the first match in Chennai was washed out by monsoonal rains, [103] Harbhajan took match figures of 4/137 as India took a 1–0 series lead in Delhi. [27] He finished the calendar year with a man of the match performance in Ahmedabad , which saw India seal a 2–0 series victory with a 259 run victory. He took 7/62 in the first innings, including six of Sri Lanka's top eight batsmen. He precipitated a middle-order batting collapse, with 6 wickets falling for 82 runs, which allowed India to take a 193-run first innings lead. Harbhajan later contributed an aggressive innings of 40 not out from 51 balls, in an unbroken 49-run final-wicket partnership with Kumble in the second innings, their display of unorthodox hitting stretching India's lead to 508 runs. [104] His prospects of a half century were cut short by a declaration from acting captain Virender Sehwag , but he was compensated with opening the bowling, as Sehwag employed a novel tactic of assigning the new ball to a spinner. [105] He took 3/79 to finish with match figures of 10/141, ending the year on a high note after he had been embroiled in the leadership struggle only three months earlier. [27]
Test decline[ edit ]
Harbhajan Singh arrives at training.
2006 began with Harbhajan's first tour to arch-rivals Pakistan. The First Test was a high scoring draw held in Lahore , where Harbhajan recorded his worst ever Test figures of 0/176, conceding more than five runs an over in a match where 1,089 runs were scored for the loss of just eight wickets. [106] In a match in which many batting records fell, Harbhajan was hit for 27 runs in one over by Shahid Afridi , just one short of the world record. [107] The second Test in Faisalabad was another high scoring draw, with the aggregate runs being the fourth highest in Test history. Harbhajan took 0/101 and 0/78. His 81 overs in the series were the fourth highest amount of overs in any Test series without taking a wicket. [108] When he was given the opportunity to make use of the batting surface in India's only innings in Faisalabad, he managed a brisk 38, including two sixes. [109] Harbhajan was dropped for the Third Test in Karachi , where a green pitch promised to favour seam bowling, and Kumble was the only spinner used. [110] After sustaining an injury, Harbhajan was sent home during the subsequent ODI series without playing a match, ending his tour without taking a wicket. [23] [111]
Harbhajan with India in 2006.
A return to Indian soil for the Test series against England failed to ease Harbhajan's wicket-taking difficulties. He managed match figures of 2/172 in the drawn First Test in Nagpur , and 1/83 in the Second Test in Mohali , where his main contribution was to hit 36 runs, helping India to a first innings lead. [27] [112] Despite taking 3/89 and 2/40 in the Third Test in Mumbai , Harbhajan ended the series with eight wickets at an average of 48.00, [28] nearly twice his career average on Indian soil. [29] Despite his difficulties in Test cricket, Harbhajan's ODI form remained strong, as he top-scored with a rearguard 37 out of 203 and then took 5/31 in a man of the match performance in the first ODI against England in Delhi , sparking a collapse of 7/47 which secured a 39-run victory. [113] [114] He ended the series with 12 wickets at 15.58 at an economy rate of 3.74 from five matches, and topped the wicket-taking list despite being rested for the last match, as well as having the best bowling average and economy rate. [115] India took the series 5–1, Harbhajan taking 3/30 in their only loss. [19]
Harbhajan was unable to maintain his ODI form on the tour to the West Indies , where he managed three wickets at 64 in five matches, although he continued to be economical, conceding 3.91 runs per over. [25] He was omitted from the Test team for the opening two Tests as India opted to use three pace bowlers and Anil Kumble , scrapping the five bowler strategy used since early-2006. [116] The reasons for the return to the four-man attack were unclear, with performance, fatigue and injury variously offered as explanations. [117] Harbhajan was recalled for the Third Test in St Kitts after the pace attack was unable to dismiss the West Indian batsmen, with local captain Brian Lara stating that his team, who had three wickets in hand at the end of play, would have been lucky to draw the Second Test had Harbhajan been playing. [118] In a drawn match, Harbhajan claimed the leading match figures of 6/186, as well as contributing an unbeaten 38 in the first innings. [119] Harbhajan's 5/13 in 27 balls in the first innings in the Fourth Test saw the hosts lose their last six wickets for 23, to give India a 97 run first innings lead. India went on secure a victory in a low scoring match in three days and win the series 1–0, although Harbhajan was punished in the second innings, conceding 65 runs in 16 overs without taking a wicket. [120] It was India's first series victory in the Caribbean in 35 years, [121] with Harbhajan contributing 11 wickets at 24.00. [28]
The 2006–07 season began with the DLF Cup in Malaysia, where Harbhajan made a good start to the season, taking six wickets at 19.16 at an economy rate of 3.59 in four matches. [25] He was man of the match against the West Indies, scoring 37 in a 78-run partnership to push India to 162, before taking 3/35 to secure a 16-run victory. [122] India failed to reach the final, contested by Australia and the West Indies. Harbhajan was unable to maintain his form in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy held in India, managing only two wickets at 51.50 and saving his worst performance of 0/49 in the final group match against Australia on his home ground in Punjab . [23] India won only one of their three matches and were eliminated, although Harbhajan continued to be tidy, conceding 3.67 runs per over. [19] The tour of South Africa in late 2006 saw even less success, taking only one wicket in three ODI matches while conceding 161 runs at the expensive economy rate of 5.75. [25] He finished the year watching from the sidelines as India fielded Kumble as the only spinner in the three Test series, which India lost 2–1. [123] Apart from the injury hit 2003, it was Harbhajan's least productive year in Test cricket since he became a regular team member in 2001, managing only 19 wickets at 52.78. [29]
Harbhajan returned for the early 2007 ODI series against the West Indies and Sri Lanka in India, taking seven wickets at 36.00 in seven matches at an economy rate of 4.27. [25] Despite criticism that he was afraid to toss the ball up, and was concentrating on bowling flat in a defensive run-saving style, [124] Harbhajan was selected as the off spin bowler in the Indian squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup , while Ramesh Powar , who had been more expensive but had taken more wickets in recent times, was omitted. [125] [126] A statistical study showed that since the start of 2006, Harbhajan has been the second most economical bowler in the final 10 overs of ODIs. [127]
During the 2007 Cricket World Cup , Harbhajan started as India's first-choice spinner and played in their first match against Bangladesh. He took 0/30 from his ten overs, but India lost the match as their batsmen collapsed and Bangladesh had no need to take risks against the bowling. [23] Harbhajan was dropped in favour of Kumble for the second match against Bermuda , which India won easily. Harbhajan was recalled for the final group match against Sri Lanka, and had little effect, taking 0/53 from his ten overs as India were set 255 for victory. Harbhajan made an unbeaten 17 as India collapsed to 185 to lose the match and be eliminated in the group phase. [23] [128] Following the failed campaign, the Indian selectors made multiple changes to the national team and Harbhajan was dropped for the tours of Bangladesh and England. Rajesh Pawar , Piyush Chawla and Powar were the spinners selected to partner Kumble. [129] Harbhajan's waning wicket-taking and his lack of flight were again perceived to be the cause of his problems. [124] [126]
In the meantime, Harbhajan played in two ODIs for the Asian Cricket Council against a combined African team, taking 1/53 and 3/48 as the Asians won both matches. [19] He then returned to Surrey for a second season of county cricket in an attempt to rediscover his form while his compatriots were touring England, staying throughout July and August. After easing into the season with six wickets in the first two first-class matches, Harbhajan found a rich vein of form, taking 4/64 and 5/64 against Worcestershire , before following up with 5/34 and 6/57 against Kent , finishing off by scoring 29 to help guide Surrey home by four wickets after they had stumbled in pursuit of 107. [19] He ended the first-class campaign with five and six wickets against Durham and Hampshire respectively and totalled 37 wickets at 18.54 in only six outings. [19] He was not so successful in the one-dayers, taking six wickets at 29.50 and an economy rate of 4.65 in five matches. [19]
Recall[ edit ]
Harbhajan returned to international cricket as part of India's squad for the ICC World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa in September 2007, which India won, having been rank outsiders at the start of the tournament with many senior players opting out of the competition. [130] He played in all six of India's matches and totalled seven wickets at 26.00 and an economy rate of 7.91. In the opening pool match against Pakistan, Harbhajan hit the stumps in a bowl-out after scores were tied; India won 3–0 after three rounds. In the semi-final against Australia, Harbhajan bowled Michael Clarke and conceded only three runs in his final over, the 18th of the match, to turn the match towards India. The final against Pakistan was the only match in which Harbhajan did not bowl his full quota of four overs, after being struck for three sixes in his third over by Misbah-ul-Haq , who led a late charge towards the target. India prevailed by five runs in the final over, Misbah being the last man to fall. [19]
Harbhajan was recalled to the ODI squad during India's home season in 2006–07, which comprised series against Australia and Pakistan. In ten ODIs, he took seven wickets at 61.71 125 and an economy rate of 4.59, much higher than his career average. [25] He scored 101 runs at 33.66 in these matches, including an unbeaten 38 in one match against Pakistan. [19] He was then recalled to the Test squad, and with India fielding two spinners in its home series against Pakistan, Harbhajan accompanied Kumble in all three Tests. [27] Playing in Tests for the first time in 16 months, he took 10 wickets at 44.10, much higher than his career average in India. [28] His best result was 5/122 in the first innings of the Second Test at Eden Gardens. [27] He toured Australia and played in three of the four Tests—India persisted with two spinners in all venues except for the Third Test at the pace-friendly WACA Ground . [27] As he was during his previous visits to Australia, Harbhajan was ineffective with the ball. In the First Test in Melbourne, he took match figures of 3/162, before taking 4/200 in the Second Test in Sydney. Upon his recall in Adelaide, he took 1/128 in Australia's only innings on a placid surface, ending the series with eight wickets at 61.25. [27] However, he did manage to take Ponting's wicket for three consecutive innings in the first two Tests, leading to much speculation about the Australian captain's difficulties against the off spinner. After the third dismissal in the Sydney Test, Harbhajan celebrated by running a distance before twice rolling over on the ground. Harbhajan's most noted contribution with the bat came in the Second Test when he came to the crease with India at 345/7, still 118 runs behind Australia, after a middle-order collapse of 4/52. He made 63 runs in a 129-run partnership with Tendulkar, which enabled India to gain a first-innings lead. In the Fourth Test, he came to the crease at 7/359 and scored 63 in a 107-run rearguard partnership with captain Kumble, allowing India to reach 529. He failed to reach double figures in his four other innings and ended with 142 runs at 23.66. [27]
Altercations with Andrew Symonds and Sreesanth[ edit ]
See also: Second Test, 2007–08 Border-Gavaskar Trophy
While Harbhajan was batting during his 63 on the third day of the Second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground , he became involved in an altercation with Australia's Andrew Symonds . As a result of this, he was charged with a Level 3 offence of racially abusing Symonds by calling the Australian—of Caribbean descent—a "monkey". Harbhajan and Tendulkar, his batting partner at the time of the incident, denied this. [131] At a hearing after the conclusion of the Test, match referee Mike Procter found Harbhajan guilty and banned him for three Tests. This decision generated controversy because no audio or video evidence was available, and the conviction relied on the testimony of the Australian players. [132] The Indian team initially threatened to withdraw from the series pending an appeal against Harbhajan's suspension, however BCCI president Sharad Pawar later claimed that the tour would proceed even if the second hearing was unsuccessful. [131] [133]

On 29 January, following the Fourth Test, the appeal hearing was conducted in Adelaide by ICC Appeals Commissioner Justice John Hansen . The result was that the racism charge was not proved, resulting in the revocation of the three-Test ban imposed by Procter. However, Harbhajan was found guilty of using abusive language and fined 50% of his match fee. Hansen later admitted he "could have imposed a more serious penalty if he was made aware by the ICC of the bowler's previous transgressions"—including a suspended one-Test ban. [134] It was reported that senior players from both sides had written a letter to Hansen requesting that the charge be downgraded. According to this report, the letter was signed by Tendulkar and Ponting and counter-signed by Michael Clarke , Hayden and Symonds. [135] [136]
In the aftermath of the hearing, Hayden called Harbhajan an "obnoxious weed" during a radio interview, which earned him a code of conduct violation charge from Cricket Australia . [137]
Following the appeal, Harbhajan played in all eight of India's round-robin matches in the Commonwealth Bank series, which also involved Sri Lanka, taking five wickets at 39.00. In the two finals matches, Australia suffered a top-order collapse and lost their first three wickets with only 24 and 32 runs on the board respectively. Symonds and Hayden—with whom Harbhajan clashed during the summer—led a recovery with stands of 100 and 89 respectively. In both matches, Harbhajan had a hand in removing both of his bitter opponents. In the first final in Sydney, he removed both in the space of four overs, caught from his bowling. In the second final in Brisbane, he completed the run out of Hayden after a mix-up, and then trapped Symonds leg before wicket in the same over. Australia lost the momentum and their run-rate slowed, and India went on to win the series 2–0. [23] Harbhajan ended with 2/38 and 1/44 from his 10 overs in the respective matches.
Following the tour of Australia, India hosted South Africa in a three-Test series. The First Test in Chennai was a high-scoring draw in which 1,498 runs were scored for the loss of 25 wickets. Harbhajan was the top wicket-taker for the match, with figures of 5/161 and 3/101. In the Second Test in Ahmedabad, he was India's leading wicket-taker for the third consecutive innings, taking 4/135 as the home team lost by an innings. With India needing a win in the Third Test in Kanpur to avoid series defeat, Harbhajan again took the leading bowling figures in both innings, with 3/52 and 4/44. His second innings effort helped bowl out the tourists for 121 and set up an eight-wicket win. As a result of his efforts, Harbhajan was named man-of-the-series, having taken 19 wickets at 25.94. [27] In contrast to his efforts in Australia, he struggled with the bat, scoring 11 runs at 2.75. He was troubled by South African paceman Dale Steyn , who dismissed him all four times by breaking through his defences, bowling him once and trapping him lbw the other three times. [19]
Sreesanth (pictured), who was slapped by Harbhajan.
Harbhajan was involved in further controversy after an 2008 Indian Premier League (IPL) match between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab at Mohali in April 2008. While the teams were shaking hands, he slapped Punjab paceman and Indian team-mate Sreesanth in the face. [138] Harbhajan, who had stood in as the Mumbai captain for the first three matches of the tournament to that point, all of which were lost, had apparently been angered by Sreesanth's aggressive sending-off of his batsmen as Punjab coasted to a decisive victory. The Kings XI Punjab lodged an official compliant to the IPL. [139] The match referee Farokh Engineer found Harbhajan guilty of a level 4.2 offence, banning him from the remainder of the IPL and preventing him from claiming his entire season's salary. Harbhajan made up with Sreesanth, and said that "I have been punished for the wrong I did". [140] Harbhajan had taken five wickets at 16.40 at an economy rate of 8.20 and scored 30 runs at 15.00 in the three matches before his ban. [19] On 14 May, the BCCI disciplinary committee found Harbhajan guilty under Rule 3.2.1 of their regulations and handed down the maximum punishment of five-match ban from ODIs. Harbhajan faces the prospect of a life ban if he commits significant disciplinary breaches in the future. [141] As a result, Harbhajan missed the tri-series in Bangladesh and the 2008 Asia Cup in Pakistan, and India went down in the final of both tournaments after qualifying first on both occasions. He would have been eligible for selection after the first two matches of the Asia Cup, but the selectors omitted him entirely.
International revival[ edit ]
Harbhajan returned to international cricket for the tour of Sri Lanka in July and August. In the First Test at Colombo, he took 2/149 as Sri Lanka amassed 600/6 declared and won by an innings. In the Second Test in Galle, he took 6/102 to help India take a first innings lead of 37 and then took 4/51 in the second innings to help India level the series with a 170-run win. It was his fifth ten-wicket match haul and his first outside India. He was again India's leading wicket-taker in the Third Test defeat, with 3/104 and 1/44. He was India's leading wicket-taker with 16 scalps at 28.12, twice as many the second most-prolific Indian. [27] In the subsequent ODI series, he played in the first four matches, taking six wickets at 18.83 at an economy rate of 3.80, including 3/40 in the win in the fourth match, which sealed the series. He was rested from the final dead rubber . [23]
At the start of the Indian season, Harbhajan took 2/32 and 4/31 as the Rest of India defeated Delhi in the Irani Trophy . [19] This was followed by the First Test against Australia in Bangalore. Harbhajan took Ponting's wicket in taking 1/103 in the first innings, but not before the Australian captain had scored 123. In reply to Australia's 430, India were in trouble at 195/6 when Harbhajan came in to bat. He scored a rearguard 54, putting on 80 with fellow bowler Zaheer Khan , to reduce India's deficit to 70. He then took 2/76 in the second innings as the match ended in a draw. [19] Ponting later cited Harbhajan and Zaheer's partnership as the passage of play that prevented an Australian win. In the Second Test at his home ground in Mohali, Harbhajan took 2/60 in the first innings as India took a 201-run first innings lead. [19] In the second innings Australia were chasing 516 for victory and had started aggressively, reaching 49/0 after seven overs. Harbhajan was introduced into the attack and removed Hayden and Simon Katich in his first over and then Mike Hussey in his next. This triggered Australia's collapse to 58/5 and their eventual defeat by 320 runs. Harbhajan was unable to find a fourth wicket, which would have seen him reach 300 Test wickets on his home ground, and ended with 3/36. He was then ruled out of the drawn Third Test because of a toe injury. Harbhajan returned for the Fourth Test in Nagpur and dismissed Ponting for the tenth time in Tests in the first innings to register his 300th wicket. He ended with 3/94 as India took an 86-run lead. However, a batting collapse meant that India were 6/166 at tea on day four, only 252 runs ahead and facing possible defeat if Australia could clean up the tail quickly. Harbhajan then scored 52, combining in a 107-run partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to guide India out of trouble. India then successfully defended the target of 380 to win by 172 runs, with Harbhajan taking 4/64 including top-scorer Hayden and the final wicket. Harbhajan was the equal-leading wicket-taker for the series along with Ishant Sharma , taking 15 wickets at 28.86. [27] He also scored 125 runs at 41.66, helping to prevent two defeats. [19] The series also saw the end of Harbhajan's partnership with Kumble, who missed the Second Test due to injury and then retired after suffering another wound in the next match. As a result, Harbhajan started a new pairing with leg spinner Amit Mishra .
In the five-match home ODI series against England, Harbhajan took seven wickets at 30.29 and an economy rate of 5.04 as India won 5–0. He took one wicket in each of the matches, except the third match in Kanpur. In that match, he took 3/31, registered his 200th ODI wicket and was named man-of-the match. [23] During the two Tests, Harbhajan was the equal-leading wicket-taker with eight wickets at 35.00 and he also scored 69 runs at 34.50. [27] This included a 40 in the first innings of the First Test to help India reach 241 after a top-order collapse, keeping India's deficit to 75; they went on to win the match. [19] Harbhajan ended the year as the third-highest wicket-taker in the world, and the highest among Indian players. He was named by Wisden in their selection of the Test team of the year.
Harbhajan then missed the ODI tour of Sri Lanka at the beginning of the year with a hamstring injury. He recovered in time to be recalled for the tour of New Zealand. Harbhajan was the leading wicket-taker from both sides in both ODIs and Tests. Harbhajan was India's most economical bowler in the two T20 internationals at the start of the tour, taking a total of 2/34 from eight overs and scoring 21 in the first match; the hosts prevailed in both games. In series that saw four of the five ODIs truncated by rain, Harbhajan took five wickets at 29.60 at an economy rate of 5.69. He took 3/27 in the opening match, and then took 2/56 from ten overs in the third game, in which both teams passed 330, helping India to wins in both matches. [19] In the First Test, Harbhajan took 1/57 and 6/63 to help set up a ten-wicket win. It was only the second time that he had taken five wickets in an innings outside the subcontinent. However, he was disappointing in a high-scoring draw in the Second Test, taking 2/120 as the hosts amassed 9/619 declared. In the Third Test, India suffered a middle-order collapse on the first afternoon, and a counterattacking 60 by Harbhajan helped them to 379. He then took 3/43 and 4/59; New Zealand had only two wickets in hand when rain caused the match to end in a draw with more than a day's playing time lost. Harbhajan ended with 16 wickets at 21.37 and 94 runs at 23.50. [19]
India won both series, their first series win in New Zealand since 1981 and 1968 for ODIs and Tests respectively.
Harbhajan then played the full 2009 Indian Premier League season in South Africa, taking 12 wickets at 21.33 and an economy rate of 5.81 in 13 matches. He was one of the most economical bowlers in the competition, and took 1/9 in four overs against Punjab to win the man of the match award. He ended the season with 4/17 against Delhi, but it was not enough to prevent a four-wicket defeat. [19]
Harbhajan was part of the Indian team that attempted to defend their crown at the 2009 World Twenty20 . However they lost all three of their matches in the Super 8s round and were eliminated. Harbhajan took 3/30 in one of those matches against England, and ended the tournament with five wickets at 26.20 and an economy rate of 6.55. [19] During the tour of the West Indies that followed, Harbhajan took three wickets at 45.33, conceding almost a run a ball in three ODIs as India prevailed 2–1.
In September, Harbhajan took 5/56 in the final of the Compaq Cup to help secure a 46-run Indian win over the hosts Sri Lanka. It was his first five-wicket haul in three years and capped off a tournament in which he took six wickets at 22.00 in three matches. He then struggled at the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa, taking 1/71 from ten overs against Pakistan and 0/54 from nine overs against Australia. India lost to Pakistan and the latter match was washed out. He then took 2/14 from eight overs against the West Indies, but it was not enough to prevent India from being eliminated in the first round, despite winning the match. [19]

After his travails in South Africa, Harbhajan started the Indian season with eight wickets at 12.87 in three Challenger Trophy one-dayers for India Blue. [19] He then played in a home ODI series against Australia taking eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.51 in six games. This included a best of 2/23 in the sixth match, but he made a more influential contribution in the first match with the bat, striking 49 at the death as India came within striking distance of their target before he s, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or a similar mailing list.

History[ edit ]
On 15 June 1909 representatives from England , Australia and South Africa met at Lord's and founded the Imperial Cricket Conference. Membership was confined to the governing bodies of cricket within the British Empire where Test cricket was played. West Indies , New Zealand and India were elected as Full Members in 1926, doubling the number of Test-playing nations to six. That year it was also agreed to make a change in membership, with election being for; "governing bodies of cricket in countries within the Empire to which cricket teams are sent, or which send teams to England." However the United States did not meet these criteria and was not made a member. [10] After the formation of Pakistan in 1947, it was given Test status in 1952, becoming the seventh Test-playing nation. In May 1961 South Africa left the Commonwealth and therefore lost membership.
In 1965, it was renamed as the International Cricket Conference and new rules adopted to permit the election of countries from outside the Commonwealth. This led to the expansion of the Conference, with the admission of Associate Members. Associates were each entitled to one vote, while the Foundation and Full Members were entitled to two votes on ICC resolutions. Foundation Members retained a right of veto.
Sri Lanka was admitted as a Full Member in 1981, returning the number of Test-playing nations to seven. In 1989, new rules were adopted and the current name, the International Cricket Council came into existence. South Africa was re-elected as a Full Member of the ICC in 1991, after the end of apartheid ; this was followed in 1992 by the admission of Zimbabwe as the ninth Test-playing nation. Then, in the year 2000 Bangladesh received test status.
Location[ edit ]
The ICC's offices in Dubai .
From its formation the ICC had Lord's Cricket Ground as its home, and from 1993 had its offices in the "Clock Tower" building at the nursery end of the ground. The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had double-tax agreements with England, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pty Ltd – known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco.
For the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001–2008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the Council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their commercial income from tax.
The option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made, through Sport England , to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London – but be given special exemption from paying UK corporation tax on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates . ICC is registered in British Virgin Islands . In August 2005 the ICC moved its offices to Dubai , and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11–1 vote by the ICC's Executive Board in favour. [11]
While the principal driver of the ICC's move to Dubai was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the MCC (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC ) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue. [12]
Rules and regulation[ edit ]
The International Cricket Council overlooks playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. Even though the ICC doesn't have copyright to the laws of cricket and only the MCC may change the laws, nowadays this would usually only be done after discussions with the game's global governing body, the ICC. The ICC also has a " Code of Conduct " to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008 the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players. [13]
Tournaments and income generation[ edit ]
Variant ICC Logo
The ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the Cricket World Cup , and it distributes the majority of that income to its members. Sponsorship and television rights of the World Cup brought in over US$1.6 billion between 2007 and 2015, by far the ICC's main source of income. [14] [15] In the nine-month accounting period to 31 December 2007 the ICC had operating income of USD 12.66 million, mainly from member subscriptions and sponsorship. In contrast event income was USD 285.87 million, including USD 239 million from the 2007 World Cup. There was also investment income of USD 6.695 million in the period.
The ICC has no income streams from the bilateral international cricket matches ( Test matches , One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals ), that account for the great majority of the international playing schedule, as they are owned and run by its members. It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC Super Series played in Australia in 2005. However these events have not been as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a failure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions Trophy to be scrapped in 2006. [16] The Champions Trophy 2004 event was referred to in Wisden 2005 by the editor as a "turkey of a tournament" and a "fiasco"; although the 2006 edition was seen as a greater success due to a new format. [17] [18]
The ICC World Twenty20 , first played in 2007 , was a success. The ICC's current plan is to have an international tournament every year, with a Twenty20 World Cup played in even number years, the World Cup continuing to be held the year before the Olympic Games , and the ICC Champions Trophy in the remaining year of the cycle. This cycle will begin in 2010 , one year after the 2009 edition .
Umpires and referees[ edit ]
The ICC appoints international umpires and Match referees who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the Elite Panel , the International Panel , and the Associates and Affiliates Panel .
As of April 2012, the Elite Panel includes twelve umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire first-class cricket in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 8–10 Test matches and 10–15 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days plus travel and preparation time per year. [19]
The International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiates in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a "third umpire" who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own county, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then the Elite Panel. [20]
The inaugural ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel was formed in June 2006. It superseded the ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel, created in 2005, and serves as the pinnacle for umpires from non-Test playing Members, with selection achieved through each of the five ICC Development Program Regional Umpires Panels. Members of the Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel are eligible for appointments to ODIs involving ICC Associate Members, ICC Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments. High-performing umpires may also be considered for other ICC events, including the ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup, and could also be invited to be involved in the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Cricket World Cup. [21]
There is also an Elite Panel of ICC Referees who act as the independent representative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it has 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket. Decisions can be appealed, but the original decision is upheld in most cases.
The Council failed to achieve consensus among the cricket playing nations as of June 2012, on application of Umpire's Decision Review System universally due to opposition by BCCI .It will continue to be applied subject to mutual agreement of the playing countries. [22] In July 2012, ICC decided to send a delegation to show the ball tracking research done by Dr Ed Rosten, an expert on computer vision and technology, to BCCI to remove the scepticism about the use of DRS technology. [23]
Members[ edit ]
Map of the current ICC member nations and its subordinate regional bodies. The members are coloured thus:
     Red: full members (that play Test cricket ) (e.g. Australia)
     Orange: associate members (e.g. Nepal )
     Gold: dependent territories of associate members (not ICC members in their own right) (e.g. Greenland)
     Blue: affiliate members (e.g. China)
     Blue Grey: suspended members (e.g. Iran)
     Green: associate members of an ICC subordinate regional body, e.g. the Asian Cricket Council , which are not yet members of the ICC (e.g. Cambodia)
     Dark grey: former members (e.g. Cuba)
     Grey: non-members (e.g. Chad)
Main article: List of International Cricket Council members
The ICC has three classes of membership: Full Members, the ten governing bodies of teams that play official Test matches; Associate Members, the 37 governing bodies in countries where cricket is firmly established and organised but have not yet been granted Full membership; and Affiliate Members, the 60 governing bodies in countries where the ICC recognises that cricket is played according to the Laws of Cricket . The ICC has recently come under significant criticism due to its failure to grant Full membership (and, consequentially, Test status) certain deserving countries, primarily Ireland , but also including Scotland and Afghanistan , among others. [24] [25] Despite the mission statement of the ICC [26] to be a "leading global sport" and to help in "promoting the global game", Full membership has not been expanded since Bangladesh was granted Full membership in 2000.

Early and personal life[ edit ]
Rayudu completed his schooling from Bhavan's Sri Ramakrishna Vidyalaya, Sainikpuri, Secunderabad. He is married to Chennupalli Vidya and lives in Hyderabad.
Domestic career[ edit ]
Rayudu made his debut in domestic cricket in the 2001/02 Ranji Trophy season for Hyderabad . After Feuds with HCA in 2005, he left the team to play for Andhra cricket team for one year. Later after a disappointing season, he went back to play for Hyderabad next season. He ran into trouble with the son of Shivlal Yadav , resulting in an ugly spat where Rayudu was attacked by Arjun Yadav with stumps after the latter was dismissed.
In 2010-11, Rayudu decided to play for Baroda after his former team Hyderabad got relegated to the Plate Division of Ranji Trophy. Rayudu continued to impress with the bat as he scored 566 runs in 9 matches with an average of 56.60 including a double hundred and three half-centuries.
In the 2012–13 Ranji Trophy season, Rayudu scored 666 runs at an average of 60.54 with a hundred and seven fifties. He played for Rest of India in the 2013 Irani Cup against Mumbai and scored 51 and 156*. He was the top-scorer in the 2012–13 Deodhar Trophy final where his innings of 78* helped West Zone chase down the target of 290 against North Zone .
National call-up[ edit ]
The likes of Suresh Raina , Robin Uthappa , Irfan Pathan , RP Singh , Dinesh Karthik , Shikhar Dhawan and VRV Singh , who played under Rayudu's captaincy at the Under-19 level, went on to represent the national senior team while Rayudu was constantly ignored by the selectors. This was mainly due to him being a part of the now-defunct 'rebel' Indian Cricket League .
On 18 July 2012, Rayudu was included in 30 probables for the World T20 tournament to be played in Sri Lanka in September 2012 [7] but failed to make it to the final squad. In December 2012, the newly formed selection panel picked Rayudu as the replacement player for the injured Manoj Tiwary for the T20 series against England. It is notable that the Chairman of this selection panel, Sandeep Patil , was also previously associated with the ICL.
During the West Indies tri-series in July 2013, Rayudu was named the replacement for Mahendra Singh Dhoni who was ruled out of the series due to a right hamstring injury.
ODI Debut[ edit ]
Rayudu was selected for the Indian tour of Zimbabwe 2013es, which is their highest Test total ever. [73]
He played his last series in the 2014–15 season in India's tour of Australia captaining India in the second and third tests; losing the second and drawing the third, trailing the series 2–0 before the Sydney Test. Following the third Test in Melbourne , Dhoni announced his retirement from the format. [74] In his last Test, he effected 9 dismissals (8 catches and 1 stumping), and in the process, went past Kumar Sangakkara in the record for stumpings with 134 (in all three formats combined) [75] and also broke the record for effecting the most dismissals in a match by an Indian wicketkeeper . [76] He finished his last innings unbeaten making 24 runs.
Captain of India
Dhoni behind the stumps
Dhoni was named the captain of Indian squad for the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 held in South Africa in September 2007. [77] India were crowned champions as Dhoni led the team to victory against Pakistan in a thrilling contest. [78] He, then, went on to become the ODI captain of the Indian team for the seven-match ODI series against Australia in September 2007. [79] He made his debut as full-time Test captain of India during the fourth and final Test against Australia at Nagpur in November 2008 replacing Anil Kumble who was injured in the third test and who then announced his retirement. Dhoni was vice-captain in this series up to that point. [80] India eventually won that Test thus clinching the series 2–0 and retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . [81] Dhoni had previously captained India on a stand-in basis against South Africa and Australia in 2008 and 2009 respectively.
It was under his captaincy that India climbed to No. 1 in the ICC Test Rankings in December 2009. After that he managed to lead India in a series-leveling world championship of Tests against the South Africans in February 2010. India also managed to draw the Test series 1–1 in South Africa later that year.
After winning the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup final against Sri Lanka on 2 April 2011 with his match winning knock of unbeaten 91, Tendulkar heaped praises on Dhoni, claiming him to be the best captain he has played under. Tendulkar mentioned that it was Dhoni's calm influence that was rubbing off on all his team-mates and described Dhoni's handling of pressure was incredible.
Only nine players have captained ten or more Tests playing as a wicket-keeper. Dhoni leads the table with 33 Tests as captain, 15 ahead of Gerry Alexander in second place. [82]
In March 2013, Dhoni became the most successful Indian Test captain when he eclipsed Sourav Ganguly ’s record of 21 victories from 49 Tests. [83] Ganguly also said in an interview to a news channel that Dhoni is the all-time greatest captain of India and he has a great record to support this credential.
Match bans
Dhoni, being captain of the Indian cricket team, has seldom faced any restrictions not to play in matches, due to slow-over rate. In December 2009, he was suspended for two ODI matches against Sri Lanka when ICC match referee Jeff Crowe imposed the ban as India was three overs short of the specified overs. Hence Virender Sehwag was named the skipper for the two matches in Cuttack and Kolkata. [84] Further, in January 2012 he was banned for the fourth Test match against Australia in Adelaide . Dhoni's team was two overs short during the third Test in Perth . [85] Consequently, Sehwag captained the team in the Adelaide test and Wriddhiman Saha kept the wickets. In the CB Series in February, Dhoni again faced a one match ban for slow-over rate against Australia.[ citation needed ]
World Cup
Dhoni has captained India in two World Cups . Under his captaincy, India won the World Cup in 2011, and reached the semifinals in 2015.
2007 Cricket World Cup
Dhoni played his first ODI World Cup in 2007 at the Caribbean. India made an early exit from the tournament in the Group Stage. In 2007 Cricket World Cup , India was placed in Group B with Sri Lanka , Bangladesh and Bermuda . Rahul Dravid captained the team in this World Cup. In three matches India played, they managed to win only one against Bermuda while losing the rest from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In their first match against Bangladesh, India was all out in just 191 in 49.3 overs. Dhoni was out for 0.He stumped Tamim Iqbal , Shakib Al Hasan and captain Habibul Bashar in the match but, India lost by 5 wickets. In the next match against Bermuda, India posted the then Highest Score in the World Cup 413/5 in a must-win match. Dhoni scored 29 off 25 Balls which includes Two 4s and One 6. India won the match by 257 runs. India was required to win their last group match against the Lankans but they lost by 69 runs. Chasing the target of 255, India crumbled to 185 all out in 43.3 overs. Dhoni was out for 0 for the second time on the tournament in his very first ball by Muttiah Muralitharan . Thus, India was out of the world cup in very first round. The Team was heavily criticized for their performance. Dhoni's under construction house in Ranchi was attacked by some 200 fans after the Bangladesh loss.
2011 Cricket World Cup
Under Dhoni's captaincy, India won the 2011 World Cup . In the final against Sri Lanka, chasing 275, Dhoni promoted himself up the batting order, coming before Yuvraj Singh . When he came to bat India needed more than six runs per over with three top order batsmen already dismissed. He started building a good partnership with Gautam Gambhir . Due to good strokeplay and active running between wickets, they kept up with the required run rate. Dhoni was on 60 off 60 balls, but later accelerated with a greater flow of boundaries , ending with 91 not out off 79 balls. Befitting the occasion, he finished the match of in style with a huge six over long-on off bowler Nuwan Kulasekara and won Man of the Match. Later in the post match presentation, he admitted that he came up the order so as to counter the Muralitharan spin threat as he was very familiar with Murali's bowling, who was his team-mate in the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Chennai Super Kings . He had come after the dismissal of Virat Kohli , also a right-handed batsman. By partnering the left-handed Gambhir, he ensured a right-left combination at the crease that makes it difficult for bowlers to settle into a rhythm.
The bat used by Dhoni in the final match was sold for ₹ 72 Lac. The money goes to Sakshi Rawat Foundation, operated by Dhoni's wife Sakshi Rawat to help orphan children. [86]
2015 Cricket World Cup
For the 2015 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand , Dhoni was named the captain of the 30-member squad by the BCCI in December 2014. [87] Under his captaincy, India was able to go through to semi-finals with ease, beating Bangladesh in the quarter finals. However, they lost to Australia in the semi-finals. The team won 7 consecutive matches in this world cup and won 11 all consecutive in world cups. With the win against Bangladesh, he became the first non-Australian captain to won 100 ODI matches, and first Indian captain to achieve the mark. He is also the third captain to won 100 matches, after two Australians, Ricky Ponting , and Allan Border . [88]
Indian Premier League
Dhoni was contracted by the Chennai Super Kings for 1.5 Million USD. This made him the most expensive player in the IPL for the first season auctions. [89] Dhoni is the present captain of the Chennai Super Kings Team . Under his captaincy, Chennai Super Kings have won two Indian Premier League titles and the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 .

The match held between Sindh & Australia in Karachi on 22 November 1935 was reported by The Sydney Morning Herald
Cricket in Pakistan has a history of even before the creation of the country in 1947. The first ever international cricket match in Karachi was held on 22 November 1935 between Sindh and Australian cricket teams. The match was seen by 5,000 Karachiites. [7] Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, cricket in the country developed steadily and Pakistan was given Test match status at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference at Lord's Cricket Ground in England on 28 July 1952 following recommendation by India, [8] which, being the successor state of the British Raj , did not have to go through such a process. The first captain of the Pakistan national cricket team was Abdul Hafeez Kardar .
Pakistan's first Test match was played in Delhi in October 1952 as part of a five Test series which India won 2–1. Pakistan made their first tour of England in 1954 and drew the series 1–1 after a memorable victory at The Oval in which fast bowler Fazal Mahmood took 12 wickets. Pakistan's first home Test match was in Bangabandhu National Stadium , Dacca , East Pakistan (now Bangladesh ). in January 1955 against India, after which four more Test matches were played in Bahawalpur , Lahore , Peshawar and Karachi (all five matches in the series were drawn, the first such occurrence in test history [9] ).
The team is considered a strong but unpredictable team. Traditionally Pakistani cricket has been filled with players of great talent but limited discipline, making them a team which could play inspirational cricket one day and then perform less than ordinarily another day. Over the years, competitions between India and Pakistan have always been emotionally charged and provide for intriguing contests, as talented teams and players from both sides of the border elevate their game to new levels to produce high-quality cricket. Pakistani contests with India in the Cricket World Cup have seen packed stadiums and elevated atmospheres no matter where the World Cup has been held. However the fans love their team.
1986 Austral-Asia Cup[ edit ]
Main article: Austral-Asia Cup
The 1986 Austral-Asia Cup , played in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates , is remembered as a famous last-ball victory for Pakistan against arch-rivals India, with Javed Miandad emerging as a national hero. [10] India batted first and set a target of 245 runs, leaving Pakistan with a required run rate of 4.92 runs per over. Javed Miandad came in to bat at number 3 and Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals. Later recalling the match, Miandad stated that his main focus was to lose with dignity. With 31 runs needed in the last three overs, Miandad hit a string of boundaries while batting with his team's lower order, until four runs were required from the last delivery of the match. Miandad received a leg side full toss from Chetan Sharma , which he hit for six over the midwicket boundary. [10] [11]
1992 Cricket World Cup[ edit ]

At the 1992 World Cup Semi-final , having won the toss, New Zealand chose to bat first and ended with a total of 262 runs. Pakistan batted conservatively yet lost wickets at regular intervals. With the departure of Imran Khan and Saleem Malik shortly thereafter, Pakistan still required 115 runs at a rate of 7.67 runs per over with veteran Javed Miandad being the only known batsman remaining at the crease. A young Inzamam-ul-Haq , who had just turned 22 and was not a well-known player at the time, burst onto the international stage with a match-winning 60 off 37 balls. Once Inzamam got out, Pakistan required 36 runs from 30 balls, which wicketkeeper Moin Khan ended with a towering six over long off, followed by the winning boundary to midwicket. The match is seen as the emergence of Inzamam onto the international stage. [12] [13] [14]
The 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand marked Pakistan's first World Cup victory. It is remembered for the comeback Pakistan made after losing key players such as Waqar Younis and Saeed Anwar and being led by an injured captain Imran Khan . Pakistan lost 3 of their first 5 matches and were nearly eliminated in the first round of the tournament after being bowled out for 74 runs against England, until the match was declared as a "no result" due to rain. Imran Khan famously told the team to play as "cornered tigers", after which Pakistan won five successive matches, including, most famously, the semi-final against hosts New Zealand and the final against England. [15]
2007 Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
The 2007 Cricket World Cup was one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history when Pakistan was knocked out of the competition in a shock defeat to Ireland , who were playing in their first competition. Pakistan, needing to win to qualify for the next stage after losing to the West Indies in their opening match, were put into bat by Ireland. They lost wickets regularly and only 4 batsmen scored double figures. In the end they were bowled out by the Irish for 132 runs. The Irish went on to win the match, after Niall O'Brien scored 72 runs. This meant that Pakistan had been knocked out during the first round for the second consecutive World Cup. [16] [17] [18] Tragedy struck the team when coach Bob Woolmer died one day later on 18 March 2007 in a hospital in Kingston, Jamaica . Jamaican police spokesman, Karl Angell, reported on 23 March 2007 that, "Mr Woolmer's death was due to asphyxiation as a result of manual strangulation" and that, "Mr Woolmer's death is now being treated by the Jamaica police as a case of murder." [19] Assistant coach Mushtaq Ahmed acted as temporary coach for the team's final group game of the tournament. [20] Subsequent to his team's defeat and the death of Woolmer, Inzamam-ul-Haq announced his resignation as captain of the team and his retirement from one-day cricket, stating that he would continue to take part in Test cricket but not as captain. [21] Shoaib Malik was announced as his successor. [22] Following his return to the squad, Salman Butt was appointed as vice-captain until December 2007. [23]
On 23 March 2007, Pakistan players and officials were questioned by Jamaican police and submitted DNA samples along with fingerprints, as part of the routine enquiries in the investigation into Woolmer's murder. [24] Three days after leaving the West Indies for Pakistan, via London, the Pakistan team were ruled out as suspects. The deputy commissioner of Jamaican police. Mark Shields, the detective in charge of the investigation, announced, "It's fair to say they are now being treated as witnesses." "I have got no evidence to suggest it was anybody in the squad." [25] A memorial service was held in Sacred Heart Church, Lahore, for Bob Woolmer on 1 April 2007. Among the attendees were Pakistan players and dignitaries, including Inzamam-ul-Haq, who was quoted as saying, "After Woolmer's family, the Pakistan team was the most aggrieved by his death." [26] After the World Cup ended, serious doubts were raised about the investigation, with increasing speculation that Woolmer died of natural causes. This has now been accepted as fact, and the case has been closed. [27]

On 20 April 2007, a PCB official announced that former Test cricketer Talat Ali would act as interim coach, in addition to his rôle as team manager, until a new coach had been appointed. [28] On 16 July 2007, Geoff Lawson , previously head coach of New South Wales, was appointed coach of the Pakistan for two years, becoming the third foreigner to take on the rôle. [29] In the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 , Pakistan exceeded expectations to reach the final but ended as runners-up, after losing the final to India in a nail-biting finish. On 25 October 2008, Intikhab Alam was named as a national coach of the team by the PCB .
2009 ICC World T20[ edit ]
On 21 June 2009 Pakistan won the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 , beating Sri Lanka in the final by eight wickets. Pakistan had begun the tournament slowly losing two of their first three matches but after dismissing New Zealand for 99 runs in the Super 8 stage they had a run of four consecutive wins against teams including previously unbeaten South Africa (in the semi-final) and SriLanka in the Final. Due to his top form, Shahid Afridi immersed as PakisArchitecture[ edit ]
The central district of Roseau is tightly packed with small and large houses and even larger modern concrete structures. There is little green or open space situated within the city, and this is even more so today, as many of the courtyards which was once commonplace within the city are giving way to office space. The district is, however, framed in every direction by natural elements. The sea and the river provide water element while the Botanical Gardens and the Government House gardens frame the city with green space. Both these elements are rare in the Caribbean . No other centre in the region has such extensive botanical gardens with such central location, and the Roseau River is amongst the largest rivers that flow through any Caribbean capital.
The urban structure of Central Roseau is based on an irregular grid system of miniature proportions, making it a highly illegible city. Even though the grid area is not very extensive, it is relatively easy for a visitor to get lost there. The grid area has some 80 blocks in the area of 30 hectares (74 acres ). In comparison, the grid areas of Kingstown and Castries — capitals of Saint Vincent and Saint Lucia — have some 50 and 60 blocks in the areas of over 40 ha (99 acre). The average block size in Central Roseau is thus some ⅓ hectare (1 acre), i.e. about half of the figure of Central Kingstown.
There are some fine examples of West Indian architecture in Roseau. The ones that stand out the most are the French Colonial style and the vernacular form . Much of the French influence can be found along King George V Street. Around the city you will come across some good examples of the English influence in the form of large colonial town houses and colonial public/government buildings.
Roseau's French Quarter
The churches in Roseau are fine examples of Europe in Dominica with a bit of creolization. The Roman Catholic Cathedral stands prominent in Gothic Romanesque revival and the Anglican Church on Victoria Street in Georgian style . Amongst these buildings you will find much of the urban vernacular squeezed in between larger colonial and more modern buildings.

Because of the suburban sprawl , few people live in Central Roseau, but more of them commute daily. Motorized vehicles pour into the central district thus introducing a mode of point-to-point interaction in an environment that was created for multiple use. As elders said, first there were no streets but just a space between the buildings. The streets of Roseau, and especially those of its central district, are not only ways to move from place to place but they are places themselves. They are used as gardens, playing fields, and social meeting places.
Street scene in Roseau
The Botanical Gardens on the fringes of the central district are mostly used by children.
Sports and recreation[ edit ]
Within the city of Roseau, there are many opportunities for recreation. Many persons seek out the tranquility and cool of the Botanical Gardens as a getaway on Sunday afternoons and at lunch. As well, it is a popular venue for local cricket matches and sports training. Football is a popular sport; there are several pitches throughout the city area (at Newtown , Potters Ville , and Bath Estate ), as well as in the sports stadium at Windsor Park.
Windsor Park
Sporting facilities and infrastructure[ edit ]
There are dedicated sports facilities around the city. Private tennis courts are located on High Street; netball and basketball courts also abound in the city's major high schools. These are complemented by community facilities at Goodwill. A dedicated netball and basketball stadium is located at Stockfarm near the Dominica State College.
In 2007, Windsor Park , also home to the Dominica national football team , was completed with a donation of EC$ 33 million from the government of the People's Republic of China .
Elsewhere in the city it is not uncommon to find that a section of the street, sidewalk or even the beach has been adapted to makeshift games of cricket or football.
Popular sports include netball, basketball, rounders and (to a much lesser extent) tennis.
Accommodations and Infrastructure[ edit ]
There are no world famous hotel chains in the city. The most famous hotel is the Fort Young Hotel . [4] In addition there are several small family owned establishments within and on the outskirts of the city.
Dominica Broadcasting Corporation , the national radio station, and two other private radio stations are located in the capital.
Non Governmental Organizations[ edit ]
Roseau is home to service clubs including, Kiwanis, Rotary and Lions. There are other organizations such as the local humane society and conservation society. ChildFund International USA has an office in Roseau from where it runs its child centered development programs for Dominica and Saint Vincent.
The Dominica Association of Industry and Commerce, Waitukubuli Ecological Foundation, Dominica Tourism Association and others are based in the city.
Transportation[ edit ]
As the most important town on the island and hub of all business activity, the city is a central point of the road networks on the island. It is an important link between northern, eastern, and southern bound traffic.
The city is served by Canefield Airport , a nearby small aircraft airport which provides direct links to nearby islands, as well as the larger Douglas–Charles Airport to the north. The ferry terminal provides direct links to the neighbouring Guadeloupe to the north and Martinique and St. Lucia to the south.
There are no rail or subway systems.
Education[ edit ]
Roseau has been the historical centre of education on the island. There are six secondary schools located in the city as well as eight primary schools . A community college , The Dominica State College, is located in Roseau. A private medical school, All Saints School of Medicine, also calls Roseau home.

Early life[ edit ]
Rahane was born on 6 June 1988 in Ashwi KD , Ahmednagar district to Madhukar Baburao Rahane and Sujata Rahane in a Maratha family. The family hails from the village of Chandanapuri, Tal-Sangamner. [4] He has a younger brother and sister, Shashank and Apurva. [5] When Rahane was seven, his father took him to a small coaching camp with a matting wicket in Dombivli , [4] [6] as they could not afford proper coaching. [4] Since he was 17, Rahane took coaching from former India batsman Pravin Amre . [7]
Rahane cleared his Secondary School Certificate from SV Joshi High School , Dombivli .
Rahane is married to Radhika Dhopavkar. Their marriage was a love marriage and took place in Mumbai on 26 September 2014. [8]
Domestic career[ edit ]
Rahane had performed well when India U-19 toured New Zealand in early 2007 with two hundreds. The tour boasted future international stars such as Virat Kohli , Kane Williamson , Ishant Sharma , Tim Southee , Trent Boult and Ravindra Jadeja . The scores in New Zealand impressed the selectors and they picked him for the Mohammad Nissar Trophy in Pakistan. He had no first-class experience prior to this match in Karachi. [9]
First-class career[ edit ]
Rahane made his first-class debut, at the age of 19, for Mumbai against Karachi Urban in the Mohammad Nissar Trophy in September 2007, at Karachi , when most of the first-choice Mumbai players were unavailable for various reasons. Opening the innings with Sahil Kukreja, he scored a century on debut 143 (207). They notched up an opening partnership of 247, as Kukreja scored 110. [10] Rahane was subsequently picked for the Irani Trophy match against Rest of India. [9]
He made his Ranji Trophy debut for his first-class side Mumbai in the 2007/2008 season. His wonderful Ranji season followed an impressive showing for West Zone in the 2007–08 Duleep Trophy , where he scored 172 against an England Lions attack comprising Graham Onions , Monty Panesar , Steve Kirby and Liam Plunkett .
Rahane, with 1089 runs in his second Ranji season (2008–09), was a crucial factor in Mumbai's 38th title win. He continued to impress in domestic cricket, scoring three hundreds each in the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons of the Ranji Trophy. [11] His first-class top score of 265 not-out (batting at no. 3 for Mumbai) came against Hyderabad at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Uppal in 2009-10 season. [12] As Rahane scored over 1000 runs thrice in his five seasons, a Test call-up became inevitable. In the 2011 Irani Trophy match against Rajasthan, Rahane scored 152 and that innings helped him get selected in India’s Test squad. [9]
List A career[ edit ]
Rahane made his List A debut for Mumbai against Delhi in the Ranji One-day Trophy in March 2007, at Delhi . [13] Scoring 61 runs on debut he was instrumental in 171 runs match winning opening partnership with former Indian opener Wasim Jaffer . Two centuries in the Emerging Players Tournament in Australia brought him a place in the India ODI squad for the tour of England in 2011. [14]
Rahane progressed through the Mumbai ranks and has also been a part of the Indian U-19 team and the India A . Ajinkya Rahane has also turned out for India Blue and India Green in the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy .
Test Career[ edit ]
Rahane was named in the Test squad to play the West Indies in November 2011. Rahane was carried in the squad for 16 months and in his presence, he saw seven players make their debuts. [15] His performance in the limited-overs cricket (ODI and T20I) during that period was also not encouraging, as he averaged around 25 in both ODI and T20 cricket, and struggled for form in the series against Pakistan and England (January 2013). [16]
Rahane finally made his debut in Test cricket on 22 March 2013 against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium , Delhi. According to the media, Rahane got this chance through "sheer luck". Shikhar Dhawan , who made a dazzling start to his career in the third Test at Mohali scoring 187 on debut, was the obvious choice for the Delhi Test until he suffered an injury to his knuckles on his left hand. Gautam Gambhir , who was picked as a replacement for Dhawan, was sidelined owing to jaundice. Rahane was handed his India Test cap by senior bowler Harbhajan Singh . It also brought an end to a lean patch for the 40-time Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai, who did not produce even a single Test player for India in since May 2007. [15] But two single-digit scores in the game prompted many to question his ability to handle pressure and replicate his domestic success at the international level. [17]
Despite his failure in the debut match, Rahane was included in the playing eleven for the first match of India tour of South Africa (2013-14). Batting in the lower-middle order, he made 209 runs at an average of 69.66 in the series (including a 96 of 157 balls at Kingsmead , Durban ) against the bowling attack comprising Dale Steyn , Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander . "For a man who had spent many a tour and series warming up the bench, carrying drinks, wondering when his opportunity will come, he has taken his chance with both hands, even though it arrived in the most difficult of conditions to bat in", cricket pundit Sidharth Monga wrote from Durban after the series. Rahane finished as India's third-highest run-getter in the series, but he was in the most precarious position of all before the series began. [18]
Rahane made his first Test ton at Basin Reserve , Wellington , New Zealand on 15 February 2014 against New Zealand . [19] India was in a difficult position when Rahane came to the crease at 156 for five and by the time he departed with 118 India were in a match-winning position ruined by Brendon McCullum ’s famous triple century [20] "He had a mountain of first-class runs backing him, of course, but did he have what goes around by the queer name of X-factor? Did he have that extra edge in his game and personality that separates top-class international players from the rest? Was he merely humble, or was he unable to assert himself, unable to absorb real pressure? After his first two Test tours to South Africa and New Zealand, we can safely conclude it must be the former. Underneath that seemingly soft exterior lurks a solid Test batsman, and he was on display at the Basin Reserve", ESPN Cricinfo wrote in their analysis. [21]
Rahane played in the Investec Test Series (India tour of England, 2014) in England. His previous overseas performances (in away Tests, Rahane averaged 61.83 having scored 371 in four Tests including a century and two fifties) earned him a place in the playing eleven over Rohit Sharma . [19] He justified his selection by making his second hundred at the second Test match at Lord's Cricket Ground . Put in to bat on a green-top wicket by Alastair Cook , India collapsed to 140 for six by tea, only to be rescued by Rahane's century. He was supported by Bhuvneshwar Kumar , who scored a valuable 36, besides putting on 90 runs for the eighth wicket. [22] In the process, Rahane became the fourth Indian batsman to post a Test century on his first appearance at Lord’s, joining Sourav Ganguly , Dilip Vengsarkar and Ajit Agarkar [23] [24]
Rahane played in the 2014-15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. In the 3rd Test match at Melbourne , Rahane made his third Test hundred. He made 399 runs in four Test including 1 century and 3 half-centuries against the opposition attack consisted of Mitchell Johnson and Ryan Harris , the core of a bowling unit that famously won 2013-14 Ashes series by 5-0.
In the first Test of 2015 tour of Sri Lanka , Rahane broke the world record for most catches in a Test match with eight. [25] In the second Test at PSS , Colombo , he scored his fourth Test hundred, scoring 126 in India's second winnings, and India went on to win the match. In the process, he reached his career-best ranking of 20th, at the ICC Player Rankings . [26]
ODI career[ edit ]
Two centuries in the Emerging Players Tournament in Australia (2011) brought Rahane a place in the India limited-overs squad for the tour of England. He made his debut against England at Chester-le-Street as a replacement for opener Virender Sehwag . Although Rahane made 40 runs at strike-rate of 90.90, India's hopes of their first victory of the 2011 summer against England were thwarted by a washout at Chester-le-Street. [27]
He did well in his maiden international series (2011 NatWest Series), against England in England, and in the return series. He made a 47 ball 54 on his second match of the latter tour. [9] Rahane failed to impress in his next few limited over matches against West Indies, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and England.
Rahane made his second ODI fifty in 2013/14 Asia Cup, only to be followed by another slump. [28] [29] In a short ODI career in the middle order, Rahane has seemed unsure and struggled at times to find the balance between defence and attack. He showed signs of comfort at the top of the order with rapid centuries against England (September 2014) and Sri Lanka (November 2014), but Rohit Sharma 's second ODI double-century followed by a big hundred against Australia at the MCG pushed Rahane back to the middle order. T20s [30] In the ICC Cricket World Cup followed, Rahane only managed to score 208 runs from 8 matches, with an average of 34.66.He was dropped by Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the second odi against Bangladesh but after the series, he was appointed as captain of India for its tour of Zimbabwe for ODIs and T20Is in 2015 when a second string squad was selected. [31] India won that ODI series 3-0, although rahane was not able to leave any big impacts with the bat, he made total of 112 in three matchs with only one half century in it. [32]
T20I career[ edit ]
Rahane made his international debut for India in a Twenty20 InternHis impressive performance was rewarded as he was included in the India A squad to play the warm-up one-day match against England on 6 January 2013. [7] With this, he became the first cricketer from the Kashmir Valley to be picked for India 'A'.
In February 2013, Rasool wreaked havoc in his three spells as he took 7 wickets which helped Board President's XI bowl out the visiting Australian side for a modest 241 and scored winning 36* runs . His seven scalps included top-order batsmen such as regular Test opener Ed Cowan , stand-in captain and wicketkeeper Matthew Wade and all-rounder Steve Smith . [8] [9]
In February 2013, Rasool became first cricketer from Jammu & Kashmir to bag an IPL contract, signing up with the Pune Warriors for the 2013 season. [10] [11] He made his IPL debut on 9 May 2013 against the Kolkata Knight Riders at Pune. He got the wicket of Jacques Kallis and finished with figures of 1/23 off 4 overs in that match. [12] He played his next IPL match against the Mumbai Indians on 11 May in which he scored 4* and bowled one over conceding five runs.
In 2013–14 Ranji Trophy , Rasool scored 663 runs with two centuries and 3 half-centuries at an average of 51 and took 27 wickets with two 5 wicket hauls in 9 matches. Under Rasool's captaincy, Jammu & Kashmir made it to the quarterfinals that season for the first time since 2000.
He was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad at the 2014 IPL Auction at ₹ 95 lakh (US$140,000). [13] [14] [15] [16] He played 3 matches in IPL 2014. In his first match of IPL 7 he took important wicket of Yuvraj Singh and bowled his spell nicely to likes of Gayle, Kohli and de Villiers, restricting them to concede minimum runs. He was awarded with Lala Amarnath best all-rounder award in domestic circuit for his performance in Ranji Trophy season 2013-14, as he scored 663 runs and took 27 wickets in total of 9 matches including 2 centuries and 3 half centuries and 2 five wicket hauls.
International Career[ edit ]
He got his call-up for the national team in 2013 for the Zimbabwe tour . He became the second cricketer after Vivek Razdan from Jammu & Kashmir to get selected for the national side, but did not play any game on that tour due to some reasons. [17] [18]
Rasool finally represented India against Bangladesh on 15 June 2014 at Mirpur where he took two for 60 in 10 overs. [19] [20] [21]

Add a category page to other categories in the normal way, using the "[[Category:Category name]]" or "[[Category:Category name|Sortkey]]" syntax.
Linking to category pages
To link to a category page without putting the current page in that category, precede the link with a colon: [[:Category:Category name]]. Such a link can be piped like a normal wikilink. (The {{ cl }} template, and others listed on its documentation page, may sometimes be helpful.)
Sort order
By default, a page is sorted under the first letter of its full name including the namespace. Also, MediaWiki groups accented characters separately from their unaccented version, so pages starting by À, Á, Ä, will be listed under separate headings, instead of under heading A.
Unlike at Special:Allpages and Special:Prefixindex , a space is treated as a space (coming before all other characters), not as an underscore.
A page whose title begins with a number will be grouped only according to the first number. Thus "1 dog", "11 dogs", and "112 dogs" all appear under the "1" heading (not under "1", "10", and "100" headings). This will cause "112 dogs" to appear before "2 dogs" on the category page.
Each of the three lists (subcategories, pages, media files) is arranged in the order explained above (except that, in the subcategories list, the namespace indicator "Category:" is not considered). If an item ought to be positioned within a list on the basis of an alternative name (sort key) for that item, then this can be specified in the category tag that places the item in the list:
[[Category:Category name|Sortkey]]
For example to add an article called Albert Einstein to the category "People" and have the article sorted by "Einstein, Albert", you would type:
[[Category:People|Einstein, Albert]]
Unlike with a piped link (which uses the same syntax), the sort key itself is not displayed to readers. It affects only the order in which pages are listed on the category page.
It is useful to document the system being used for sort keys on the category page. For guidelines about the use of sort keys on Wikipedia, see WP:SORTKEY .
Default sort key
See also: WP:NAMESORT and WP:SORTKEY
It is possible to set a default sort key which is different from
{{PAGENAME}}
by using the magic word
{{DEFAULTSORT}}
thus:
{{DEFAULTSORT:new key}}
In the case of multiple default sort key tags, the last DEFAULTSORT on the final rendering of a page applies for all categories, regardless of the position of the category tags. This also means that a DEFAULTSORT tag included from a template is not effective if another DEFAULTSORT tag occurs later on the page, even if the later DEFAULTSORT tag is also "hidden" (included by another template).
Hiding categories
When the magic word
__HIDDENCAT__
is placed on a category page, that category becomes hidden, meaning that it will not be displayed on the pages belonging to that category. On Wikipedia, the magic word is not normally used explicitly, but is applied through the {{ hiddencat }} template. The feature is mostly used to prevent project maintenance categories from showing up to ordinary readers on article pages.
However, hidden categories are displayed (although listed as hidden):
on category pages (whether as parent categories or subcategories);
at preview during editing;
if the user has selected "Show hidden categories" in user preferences.
Hidden categories are automatically added to Category:Hidden categories .
For guidelines on the hiding of categories on Wikipedia, see WP:HIDDENCAT .
Categories and templates
A template can be used to add pages to a category, usually by placing the category link inside <includeonly></includeonly> tags on the template (e.g.
<includeonly>[[Category:category name]]</includeonly>
). When the template is transcluded into the page, the category link becomes active, and the page is added to the category page. This is useful for categories that have high turnover or many pages included, like cleanup categories.
Changes to the template, however, may not be reflected immediately on the category page. When you edit an article to add a category tag directly, the list of category members is updated immediately when the page is saved. When a category link is contained in a template, however, this does not happen immediately: instead, whenever a template is edited, all the pages that transclude it are put into the job queue to be recached during periods of low server load. This means that, in busy periods, it may take hours or even days before individual pages are recached and they start to appear in the category list. Performing a null edit to a page will allow it to jump the queue and be immediately recached.
To add the template itself to the category page as well, omit the "includeonly" tags. To add the template to a category without categorizing pages on which the template is transcluded, place the category declaration between <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags, or add it to the template documentation page between <includeonly></includeonly> (the latter allows recategorizing the template without editing it, which is helpful if it is protected, or so complicated that mere mortals hesitate to touch it).
Parser functions can be used to make the transcluded categories, or the sort key used in them, dependent on other variables, notably PAGENAME.
Passing a category by parameter
<includeonly>[[Category:{{{cat|default}}}]]</includeonly> or <includeonly>{{{cat|[[Category:default]]}}}</includeonly>
If the user provides a parameter 'cat=XXX' the page will be categorized at the page [[Category:XXX]], otherwise it will be categorized at the page [[Category:default]]. Calling the template with "cat=" (equal to nothing) disables putting the page in any category.
Excluding non-article pages
<includeonly>{{#if:{{NAMESPACE}} | | [[Category:XXX]]}}</includeonly>
the variable NAMESPACE is null for mainspace articles. For any space other than mainspace, this ParserFunction will produce an empty string, but for regular articles this will include the article in Category:XXX.
On Wikipedia it is not recommended that templates be used to populate ordinary content categories of articles. See Categorization using templates in the categorization guideline.
Categorizing redirect pages
Redirect pages can be categorized. The category tag must be placed after the redirect link. On a category page, redirects are listed in italics.
For conventions on the categorization of redirects in Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:Categorizing redirects .
Moving and redirecting category pages
Categories can be moved in the same way as an ordinary page; but a certain amount of cleanup may be necessary. A redirect is left at the old category name, and this is not a normal
#REDIRECT [[...]]
{{ category redirect }}
. Once all the pages have been moved out of the old category, it may be left as a category redirect, or deleted. For categories entirely populated through templates (see above), modifying the templates enables all affected articles to be moved to another category, but with the refresh problem mentioned. Almost all category name changes are made pursuant to a consensus decision at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion .
Do not create intercategory redirects other than with a
template. See Wikipedia:Categories for discussion#Redirecting categories for more on category redirects.
Searching for articles in categories
For more details on this topic, see Help:Searching § Syntax .
In addition to browsing through hierarchies of categories, it is possible to use the search tool to find specific articles in specific categories. To search for articles in a specific category, type incategory:"CategoryName" in the search box.
An "OR" can be added to join the contents of one category with the contents of another. For example, enter
incategory:"Suspension bridges" OR incategory:"Bridges in New York City"
to return all pages that belong to either (or both) of the categories, as here .
Note that using search to find categories will not find articles which have been categorized using templates. This feature also doesn't return pages in subcategories.
"Related Changes" with categories
For a category, the " Related Changes " feature, applied to the corresponding category page, lists recent changes to the pages currently listed as belonging to that category. Where those pages are subcategories or image pages, only changes to their editable parts are listed.
Notice that "Related Changes" does not list recent changes to pages linked from the editable part of the category page (as it would normally, with a non-category page). (If a workaround is required for this, the links in question could be placed in a template and transcluded onto the category page.)

2010 ICC World T20[ edit ]
The 2010 World T20 was held in West Indies, where Pakistan was able to reached for the semi-final stage. Pakistan, Australia and Bangladesh were in Group A. Pakistan won the first match against Bangladesh by 21 runs. Salman Butt became the hero of the match with his 73 runs from just 46 balls. The second match for Pakistan was with Australia, where Australia won the toss and elected to bat. They scored 191/10 with 49 ball 81 runs by Shane Watson . In this match, final over of Australian innings was bowled by Mohammad Aamer . He took a triple-wicket maiden and there were two run-outs, and eventually five wickets fell in the final over of Australia's innings.
In Super 8s stage, Pakistan lost to England, and New Zealand, only won against South Africa. They finished only behind England in Group E of Super 8s, reached to the semi-finals The semi-final for Pakistan was again with Australia, where they only scored 191/6 with Umar Akmal's not out 56 runs. Australia had a good start, where Michael Hussey scored a match winning unbeaten 64 runs from just 24 balls. Australia scored 197/7 in 19.5 overs and won the match. With this match, Pakistan lost their defended World T20 title.

Early life[ edit ]
One of Symonds' biological parents was of West Indian background and the other was believed to be of Danish or Swedish descent. [5] Symonds' adoptive parents Ken and Barbara moved to Australia shortly after his adoption, when he was three months old. [6] Of the adopted siblings, Louise Symonds participated in Gladiators . He also has two non-adopted siblings. He spent the early part of his childhood in Charters Towers , northern Queensland, where his father Ken taught at the private fee paying All Souls St Gabriels School, which Andrew attended. [7] He showed sporting prowess from a very early age. "Dad was cricket mad. He’d throw balls to me five or six days a week, before school, after school. And we’d play all sorts of games inside the house with ping-pong balls and Christmas decorations." [8] Much of his junior cricket was played in Townsville for the Wanderers club, father and son making the 270-kilometre return trip sometimes twice a week. [6] The family later moved to the Gold Coast , where his parents were on the staff of All Saints Anglican School in Merrimac . Symonds was a student at the school. [9]
Overview of cricket career[ edit ]
Symonds is an aggressive right-handed batsman who can also bowl off spin or medium pace, making him a good all-rounder . He is an exceptional fielder , with a report prepared by Cricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup , he had effected the fifth equal most run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the fourth highest success rate. [10] He is very agile for his size and weight (medium-heavy build; 187 cm tall), has excellent reflexes, is able to take catches well and has a powerful and accurate throwing arm. His nickname is Roy, shortened from the name Leroy, after a coach from early in his career believed he resembled local Brisbane NBL hero Leroy Loggins . [11] He was an AIS Australian Cricket Academy scholarship holder in 1994. [12] In 1995, after playing in his first season for English county Gloucestershire, Symonds won the Cricket Writer's Club Young Cricketer of the Year award. [13] Shortly afterwards Symonds was selected as part of the England A team that was to tour Pakistan in the winter, however, he decided not to go, instead choosing to pursue an international career for Australia. His place on the tour was later taken by Middlesex player, Jason Pooley . [13]
Domestic cricket[ edit ]
Australian state cricket[ edit ]
Since making his debut for the Queensland state team in the 1994–95 season Symonds has scored more than 5,000 runs and taken more than 100 wickets for his state. Symonds scored 113 and took four wickets in a losing cause in the Sheffield Shield final in 1999 and was named Man of the Match in the 2002 Pura Cup final after scoring 123 runs and taking six wickets.
English counties[ edit ]
Symonds has played for four English counties during his career— Gloucestershire , Kent , Lancashire and Surrey . [13] Symonds first appearance for an English county was with Gloucestershire. Initially he was considered an England-qualified player, however, following his first season of county cricket in 1995 he declared that his allegiances lay with Australia when he chose not to tour Pakistan with the England A team. [13]
It was in this season though that he hit a record 16 sixes in his unbeaten 254 against Glamorgan at Abergavenny . In doing so, he beat the previous mark set by New Zealand's John R. Reid . Wisden reported that the 16th six "landed on a tennis court about 20 feet (6.1 m) over the boundary" and "though he was undoubtedly helped by the short boundaries, it would have been a hugely effective innings on any ground in the world". Symonds added four more sixes in the second innings, to beat the old record of 17 in a match, set by Warwickshire's Jim Stewart against Lancashire at Blackpool in 1959.
Between 1999 and 2004 Symonds played for Kent. One of the highlights of his time there came on 2 July 2004, when he hit a 43-ball 112 for Kent Spitfires in a Twenty20 Cup match against Middlesex Crusaders . [14]
In July 2005 he signed for Lancashire for the rest of the English season having finished duties as part of Australia's ODI squad.
In April 2010 he signed for Surrey to play in the Friends Provident t20 competition.
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
On 20 February 2008 Symonds signed up with the IPL franchise Deccan Chargers from Hyderabad for US$1,350,000 which made him the second most expensive player in the league at that time. The same team also secured Australian team-mate Adam Gilchrist for US$700,000. The IPL commenced on 18 April 2008. On 24 April 2008 Symonds made 117 not out off 53 balls against the Rajasthan Royals . [15] The Royals ended up winning that match as Symonds bowled the last over and conceded 19 runs when the Royals required 17 runs from six balls.
Symonds missed most of the second season of the IPL due to International commitments. However, he played a crucial part in the triumph of his team towards the end of the season.
Symonds started the third season convincingly scoring two 50s in his first three games with the Mongoose Cricket Bat . [16] [17]
In the fourth season, Symonds was contracted by Mumbai Indians for US$850,000.
International career[ edit ]
Although Symonds was originally qualified to play for England due to it being the country of his birth, and West Indies due to his ancestry, [18] in 1995 he decided that he wished to pursue an international career for Australia instead. [13] His international debut came on 10 November 1998, when he played in a One Day International (ODI) for Australia against Pakistan at Lahore. [19] As an ODI player, he is known for scoring runs at an excellent strike rate of over 90, with a highest score of 156.
However, at the start of his international career, Symonds struggled to make an impact with the bat and ball, although his fielding was of high quality, and was not a regular member of the playing XI. He cemented his place in the team in Australia's opening match of the 2003 Cricket World Cup , having been controversially given a lifeline before the start of the tournament when captain Ricky Ponting publicly called for his selection in the team[ citation needed ] after allrounder Shane Watson had to withdraw due to injury. Australia had no choice but to pick Symonds after their squad was depleted at the start of the campaign; Shane Warne was sent home after failing a drugs test, Darren Lehmann was still serving a suspension for racial abuse, and Michael Bevan was injured.
In the first match against Pakistan, Symonds scored 143* to guide Australia from 4/86 to 8/310, and Australia went on to a heavy victory and won all their matches to claim the World Cup. Following this breakthrough series, Symonds became consistently effective and a core member of the ODI team. Symonds is sometimes branded as a one-day International 'specialist' as his ODI record with both ball and bat are far better than that of his Test match averages.
In March 2004, Symonds made his long-awaited Test debut in Australia's tour of Sri Lanka after showing great form in One Day International cricket in 2003. The decision was regarded as speculative and based on ODI form rather than a proven track record in first-class cricket, and he replaced Simon Katich , who had scored a century and unbeaten fifty in Australia's previous Test.
Playing as a batsman, Symonds encountered difficulty against Muttiah Muralitharan on the dusty, spinning Sri Lankan tracks, failing to pass 25 in any of his four innings, and was dropped after two Test matches in favour of Katich. Australia then continued to pursue their policy of selecting six specialist batsmen in the longer form of the game, and Symonds was not recalled in that time.
He was recalled in November 2005 following the injury to Shane Watson , as Australia's search for an all-rounder continued. After five Tests, with a batting average of 12.62 and a bowling average of 85.00, his position in the team was under a cloud until the 2005 Boxing Day Test . On the first day of the match, he was out caught behind for a golden duck . Then, with his batting average threatening to drop under 10 and bowling average pushing 100, Symonds took 3/50 in the South African first innings before blasting 72 off 54 balls in the second innings (including a new Australian record for the fastest Test fifty—40 balls) and taking 2/6.
Andrew Symonds batting against South Africa in 2006
At the 2006 Allan Border Medal count, Symonds would have won the One Day player of the year award as he polled the most votes, but was ineligible due to a late night of drinking which led to him turning up still inebriated to a match against Bangladesh , after which he was suspended. Symonds won Player of the Series in the 2005–06 Australian VB Series .
While batting in the second Test in the Australian 2006 tour of South Africa, Symonds was struck in the face of his helmet by a bouncer off Makhaya Ntini . Symonds required four stitches on the inside of his upper lip. Struggling for reliable impact, Symonds was again dropped at the end of this series.
Following the retirement of Damien Martyn during the Ashes in 2006–07 Symonds was again recalled to the team. Scoring just 26 and 2 in his first Test back he found himself under pressure to justify his place in the team. In the Boxing Day Test Symonds faced his biggest challenge when arriving at the crease with Australia in deep trouble at 5/84. After a slow start to his innings he proceeded to score his first Test century, combining with his good friend Matthew Hayden to put on a 279 run partnership and bringing up the century with a six. Symonds was finally dismissed for 156.

Although selected in Australia's 15-member World Cup squad he was unavailable for selection for the first few matches because he ruptured his biceps while batting against England on 2 February 2007 in the Commonwealth Bank Tri Series . Surgery was performed and Symonds underwent extensive physical rehabilitation. As a result, he missed the remainder of that tournament as well as the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy in New Zealand while Australia suffered their longest losing streak in over a decade. Symonds remarkably made a relatively quick recovery after returning for Australia's win in their last preliminary World Cup match against South Africa . [20] [21] He bowled the final ball of the 2007 Cricket World Cup that was hosted in the West Indies.The final was contested between Australia and Sri Lanka and was shortened to 38/36 overs per side due to rain throughout the day. [22] Even the final few overs of the Sri Lanka innings were played in almost darkness.
Allegations of racial taunts[ edit ]
Main article: Second Test, 2007-08 Border-Gavaskar Trophy
In 2007, crowds at the One Day Series in Vadodara , Nagpur and Mumbai were seen to offend Symonds with monkey chants. After the BCCI initially denied the incident at Vadodara took place, further incidents occurred at the other grounds in the series. [23] [24]
During Sri Lanka's tour of Australia in 2007–08 he had good form with the bat but had an ankle injury which ruled him out of the rest of the Test series.
Symonds playing for Australia against India in 2008.
During the second Test against India on 2 January 2008 Symonds completed his second Test century, coming to the crease with Australia at 4/119. When Michael Clarke (1) and then Adam Gilchrist (7) were dismissed in quick succession Australia found themselves in poor shape at 6/134. Symonds and Brad Hogg put on a record 7th wicket partnership at the S.C.G (also a record for Australia vs. India) of 173 until Hogg was dismissed for 79. Symonds was the beneficiary of some controversial decisions in the course of his innings. At stumps on the first day, Symonds was not out on 137, and Australia 376/7. By the end of the innings, Symonds finished on 162 not out, when the Australians were finally bowled out for 463. [25] In January 2008, Indian spin bowler Harbhajan Singh received a three-match ban after a complaint that he had racially abused Symonds during the third day of the Second Test at the SCG. It was alleged that Harbahjan called Symonds a "monkey" after Symonds confronted him over touching fellow Australian player Brett Lee . The case was decided by the match referee, Mike Procter , in a hearing held after the match. [26] The BCCI lodged an appeal against the decision. On 29 January 2008, after the hearing of the appeal, at Adelaide by ICC appeals commissioner John Hansen , the racism charge on Harbhajan Singh was not proved and the three Test ban was lifted. However, a lesser charge (Level 2.8 offence) of using abusive language was applied and Harbhajan was fined 50% of his match fee. Hansen later admitted that he "could have imposed a more serious penalty if he was made aware by the ICC of the bowler's previous transgressions"—including a suspended one Test Match ban. The ICC claimed the "database and human errors ... played a part in Harbhajan Singh escaping a more severe penalty during his appeal hearing in Adelaide". [27] Hansen also criticised Symonds in his report accusing him of swearing at Harbhajan after a friendly gesture by the Indian bowler towards Brett Lee . It was also reported that senior players had written a letter to John Hansen requesting a downgrading of the charge. The letter was signed by Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting and counter-signed by Michael Clarke , Matthew Hayden and Symonds. [28] [29] The stump microphone audio was removed immediately after the alleged incident between Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds was released by Channel Nine. [30]
In his 2013 autobiography At the Close of Play, Ricky Ponting expressed his disillusionment with Cricket Australia for failing to support Symonds, who, though the victim of abuse, was painted as a villain. Daniel Brettig notes how, "duly disillusioned", Symonds "drifted from the game via a series of disciplinary problems". [31]
During the second final of the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series against India on 4 March 2008, Symonds shoulder charged a male streaker who had entered the playing arena. Symonds, who had once considered a career in rugby league with the Brisbane Broncos , [32] may have faced assault charges had the man taken legal action. [33]
Controversy and dismissal[ edit ]
Symonds was set to play for Australia in the August 2008 series against Bangladesh in Darwin , but was sent home to Queensland after missing a team meeting while out fishing . Stand-in captain Michael Clarke told the media that Symonds would have to re-evaluate his desire to represent Australia: "The main concern from us is Andrew's commitment, to playing for this team and, in my opinion and I MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's . [66]
Twenty20[ edit ]
Lee made his Twenty20 and T20 International debut on 15 February 2005 against New Zealand in the first ever T20 international match. [67] He was called up to the squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 . During the tournament, he made history by claiming the first hat trick in T20 internationals in the Group F match against Bangladesh and also won the Man of the Match award. [68]

Ponting then scored 10 and 59 as Australia recorded comfortable innings victories in their inaugural series against Bangladesh, played in Darwin and Cairns in the tropical north of Australia in the winter of 2003. In the third and final match of the ODI series following the Tests, Ponting scored a composed century, as he and Michael Bevan put on a run-a-ball 127-run stand. [130]
Australia's cricket summer started in October; a month earlier than usual because of their ODI series in India following their home series against Zimbabwe. [131] Due to the season's early start, many of the Australian players were not match fit. McGrath missed the series with an ankle injury, while there were concerns about whether Australia should be playing Zimbabwe because of Robert Mugabe 's regime. [132] The first Test started on 9 October in Perth, as Australia started strongly batted first against a Zimbabwean bowling attack that lacked penetration on a flat WACA wicket. [133] However, Ponting was dismissed leg before wicket for 37, [134] while Hayden went onto break Brian Lara 's world record Test score of 375. [135] Australia won the Test by an innings and 175 runs on the final day. [136] In the next Test at the SCG Australia fielded an inexperienced team due to injuries and won by nine wickets; sweeping the series 2–0. Ponting struck 169 and 53 not out, and passed 5,000 Test runs during his first innings century. [137] The Australian number three ended the two-match series with 259 runs at 129.50. [64] In the midst of the lack of public attention and poor crowds, Ponting wrote how he was unsure whether Bangladesh and Zimbabwe should be playing Test cricket. [138]
Australia flew to India two-day after the conclusion of the Zimbabwean series to play in the TVS Cup against India and New Zealand. They opened their campaign on 26 October against India in Gwalior , but where defeated by 37 runs, as Ponting was dismissed for two. Australia played New Zealand in match three of series in Faridabad . An early 9 am start saw New Zealand bowled out for 97, despite Australia bowling 17 wides. Australia comfortably reached the target, losing only two wickets in the process; one of which was Ponting for 12, who felt that he was "in terrible form.". [139] Before Australia's next game, Ponting was named the Wisden International Cricketer of the Year in an award ceremony in Mumbai. [140] Two days later, the city saw Australia defeat India by 77 runs, helped by Ponting's 31. [141] [142] He continued his run without a large score, managing just 16 in the fifth match of the series against New Zealand; however, Australia won a hard fought contest. [143] He regained his form in a victory over New Zealand in match—scoring 52 in Guwahati . [144] Ponting improved further against India in match eight in Bangalore . After Gilchrist scored his first ODI century against India, Ponting scored an unbeaten 108 from 103 balls, to help Australia win by 61 runs. Ponting hit seven sixes and one four, becoming the first batsman to end up with only one four in an ODI century. [145] [146] [147] Ponting struggled to come to terms with the pitch early, reaching his 50 in 69 balls, before scoring his next 50 in 31 deliveries. [148] After defeating New Zealand, India qualified for the final against Australia. Batting first in Kolkata, Australia managed 5/235, as Ponting scored 36. India were bowled out for 198, leaving Australia victors by 37 runs. [149] [150] [151] He finished the series with 296 runs—the third highest run-scorer—at an average of 42.83. [152]
Most runs by an Australian in a calendar year (2003)[ edit ]

After making 54 and 50 in the rain-drawn First Test in Brisbane, Ponting scored double-centuries in back-to-back Tests against India, in the Second Test at Adelaide (242) and at Melbourne (257, his career high). [153] [154] He hit 31 not out in the second Test against New Zealand, innings in Melbourne as Australia levelled the series 1–1 and scored 25 and 47 in the drawn Fourth Test in Sydney to end as the leading run-scorer for the series, with 706 runs at 100.85. [64] Harbhajan had been sent home after the First Test with an injury to his spinning finger.
Having also scored 206 at Port-of-Spain earlier in the year, he became only the second player ( Sir Donald Bradman the other) to hit three double-centuries in a calendar year. [155] Ponting's 242 against India at Adelaide is also the highest ever Test score by a batsman whose team was subsequently defeated in the match. [156] After Steve Waugh 's retirement at the beginning of 2004 following the drawn home series against India, Ponting assumed the Test captaincy. Since 1997 the Australian team has not always had the same captain for Tests and for ODIs, with Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh being dropped from the ODI team whilst still the Test captain.
2004–2008: Appointment as Test captain[ edit ]
Main articles: 2004 ICC Champions Trophy , New Zealand cricket team in Australia in 2004–05 and Pakistani cricket team in Australia in 2004–05
Ricky Ponting was destined to lead his country – I couldn't have handed Australian cricket's ultimate individual honour to a more capable and deserving man. A leader must earn respect and lead from the front, and on both of these counts Punter has undoubtedly excelled. When the one-day leadership duties were passed over to Ricky in South Africa, my main piece of advice to him was, 'Make sure you take care of your own game and maintain your form, because everything else will follow from that.' Since assuming the mantle, Punter has shown himself to be among the top three batsmen in the world in both forms of the game, and has elevated his hunger and desire for runs to a level most can only aspire to.
— Steve Waugh writing about Ponting replacing him as Australian captain [157]
After Steve Waugh 's (pictured) retirement at the beginning of 2004 following the drawn home series against India, Ponting assumed the Test captaincy.
Ponting started with a 3–0 clean sweep of the Test series in Sri Lanka. Ponting brought Symonds into the Test team on the back of strong ODI form, rather than first-class cricket, replacing Simon Katich , who had scored a century and unbeaten fifty in the last Test. However, this backfired and Symonds was dropped after two Tests. Nevertheless, it was a far cry from Australia's last two Test campaigns in Sri Lanka, which had resulted in a 1–0 and 0–1 results respectively. Individually though, Ponting struggled, especially in comparison to his efforts in 1999. He scored 198 runs at 33.00, his only effort beyond 30 being 92 in the first innings of the Third Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo. [64]
Australia hosted Sri Lanka for two Tests during the winter, in the tropical north. Ponting missed the victory in the First Test in Darwin due to a family bereavement, and scored 22 and 45 as the Second Test in Cairns was drawn.
Despite their success at World Cups, Australia continued their failure to win the ICC Champions Trophy . They were knocked out by hosts England in the semifinals in 2004.
After missing most of the tour of India due to injury, Ponting returned for the Fourth Test. By this time, Australia had taken an unassailable 2–0 series lead, his deputy Gilchrist leading the tourists to their first Test series win in India since 1969–70. Leading spinner Shane Warne injured himself on the eve of the match, which was played on a very dry pitch at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai . Off spinner Nathan Hauritz and leg spinner Cameron White , who were not regular wicket-takers in domestic cricket, were surprise selections ahead of Stuart MacGill for the tour. The reasoning given by the selectors was that as they intended to play only one spinner—Warne—MacGill was unlikely to play so they would not lose anything by taking some young spinners instead, in order to gain experience. However, it was too late for MacGill to be flown in, and Hauritz played and took 5/103. Ponting made 11 and 12 and Australia lost a low-scoring match in less than two days' equivalent playing time. Ponting was very vocal in criticising the playing surface after the match.

Ponting oversaw a successful campaign in the 2004–05 Australian season. They won all five Tests, defeating New Zealand 2–0 and Pakistan 3–0. Ponting scored 145 runs at 72.50 against New Zealand in a winning start to his Test captaincy on home soil.
Up to this point, Ponting's prolific form with the bat in 2003 had tapered away following his ascension to the captaincy and he had not made a century in eight Tests, a long period by his standards. In the First Test against Pakistan in Perth, Ponting made 98 in the second innings. Australia went on to crush the visitors by over 400 runs. Ponting struck 62 not out in the second innings as Australia won by nine wickets in the Second Test in Melbourne, and then brought up his maiden century as captain, scoring 207 in the New Year's Test in Sydney, which ended in another convincing nine-wicket triumph. He ended the series with 403 runs at 100.75.
Australia then won a three-Test tour against New Zealand away 2–0. Ponting ended the series in style, scoring 105 and 86 not out in the Third Test win in New Zealand. In his first Test series in the country, he scored 293 runs at 97.66.
Australia lose an Ashes series for the first time since 1987[ edit ]
Main articles: 2005 Ashes series and ICC Super Series 2005
Australia lost to England 2–1 after starting the series as favourites. [158] Ponting thus became the first Australian captain since Allan Border in 1986–87 to lose an Ashes series. The 2005 series was hailed as one of the great Test series, but Ponting faced significant criticism afterwards and his tenure as captain was questioned. [159] [160] In his defence, Ponting said that Australia had simply been outplayed and had not stepped up at crucial moments in the matches. He rejected suggestions that Shane Warne should be captain in his stead. [161]
After the first two matches the score was 1–1. England had the upper hand throughout the third Test at Old Trafford , where Australia needed to bat through the last day to force a draw . Ponting scored 156, the first Australian century of the series, and was dismissed only four overs from the end of the day. [162] This left Australia nine wickets down but their final pair survived the remaining overs. In the fourth Test at Trent Bridge , Australia again batted poorly and was forced to follow-on. In the second innings, Ponting was well set on a score of 48, and England was in some difficulty due to an injury to key paceman Simon Jones , when the Australian captain was run out by a direct hit from the substitute fielder ( Gary Pratt ). Ponting reacted angrily, directing an abusive tirade at the English support team in the pavilion concerning the liberal use of substitutes as he walked into the Australian rooms. England had routinely used substitutes so that their bowlers could receive massages between their spells, but in this case, Pratt was on the field due to an injury to Jones, who had been taken to hospital and would go on to miss the fifth and final Test match of the series. Ponting was later fined 75% of his match fee by the match referee. [163]
Australia went on to lose the match, despite a spirited fightback with the ball on the last day. Also in this match Ponting bowled six overs, and took his first wicket since March 1999; Michael Vaughan caught behind by Adam Gilchrist . The Fifth Test at The Oval was curtailed by rain and although Australia had the English batsmen in danger on the final day, a rearguard counterattacking partnership by Kevin Pietersen and Ashley Giles on the final afternoon secured a draw for the hosts. Thus, the Ashes were lost for the first time in 16 years.
The setback to Australia, and to Ponting as Australian captain, of the 2005 Ashes defeat, was to prove a strong motivation for the Australian camp to improve their standards and overcome any complacency that may have arisen from Australia's being the world's premier cricketing nation for a decade. Prior to the Ashes defeat, Australia's dominance had prompted the ICC to organise a series against a World XI, immediately after the Ashes. Following the Ashes defeat, Australia were expected to struggle against the World XI, but bounced back to whitewash them 3–0 in the ODIs; they also won the only Test easily, Ponting scoring 46 and 54. However, the series was also criticised due to the apparent lack of collective desire of the World XI, who were regarded more as a collection of individuals.
Twin centuries in 100th Test[ edit ]

In any case, Australia were untroubled during the 2005–06 season. They whitewashed the West Indies 3–0 before defeating South Africa 2–0 in three Tests. They then reciprocated South Africa's tour and recorded a 3–0 whitewash in the Tests. In the series against the West Indies, Ponting scored a century in each innings of the First Test in Brisbane, 149 and 104 not out. In his first Test as captain in front of the Tasmanian public, Ponting managed 17 and 0 not out, and he ended the series with 329 runs at 82.25.
Ponting was in a rich vein of form against the South Africans. After scoring 71 and 53 in the drawn First Test in Perth, Ponting scored 117 on Boxing Day in the Second Test at the MCG. Australia won the match and Ponting scored 120 and 143 not out to end the series and start the New Year with a dramatic win in the Third Test at the SCG. South African captain Graeme Smith declared on the final morning of a rain-curtailed match and tried to open up the game in a bid to equal the series. He left Australia a target of 287 runs in 76 overs, and Ponting made 143 not out in only 159 balls to secure an eight-wicket win. It was the first time anyone had scored two centuries in their 100th Test and Ponting was named man of the match and man of the series. He had scored 515 runs at 103.00.
Australia's first Champions Trophy victory[ edit ]

In 2005, Ponting began using cricket bats with a graphite covering over the wooden blade of the bat, as did other players contracted to Kookaburra Sport . This was ruled by the MCC to have contravened Law 6.1, which states that bats have to be made of wood, although they may be "covered with material for protection, strengthening or repair not likely to cause unacceptable damage to the ball". Ponting and Kookaburra agreed to comply, before the series against South Africa. [164]
Australia continued their run in South Africa even in the absence of McGrath for family reasons. Ponting scored 103 and 116 in the Second Test in Durban, making it three Test centuries in consecutive innings at the ground. He ended the series with 348 runs at 58.00. On 12 March 2006, Ponting scored 164 in only 105 balls in the 5th ODI against South Africa in Johannesburg , as Australia made a record total of 434 for 4, only to be beaten by South Africa's 438 for 9. [165] At the end of the match Ponting was jointly awarded Man of the Match with Herschelle Gibbs . Ponting was not happy with the performance and once in the dressing rooms delivered "the biggest spray" he hoped to do while captain of Australia. [166]
The Australians moved on to their maiden Test tour of Bangladesh thereafter, and narrowly avoided an ignominious loss in the First Test at Fatullah. After the home side took an unexpected first innings lead, Ponting scored an unbeaten 118 in the second innings to guide his team to a three-wicket win. He scored 52 in the Second Test as Australia won by an innings and took the series 2–0.
Australia won the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy in India, finally winning the ODI tournament that had eluded them despite their World Cup success. After the final in Mumbai, Ponting drew some criticism for appearing to ask BCCI president and Indian cabinet minister Sharad Pawar to "leave the podium" and pointing towards the exit with his finger, while his team-mate Damien Martyn pushed him gently in the back so that his team could commence celebrations. The issue, while minor, was solved when Ponting issued a formal apology to Pawar. [167] [168]
Ashes regained and 10,000 ODI runs at 2007 World Cup[ edit ]

In November 2006, the England cricket team again took on Australia in the first Test of a five Test series that was widely expected to be a tremendous contest between Australia, the top team on the world cricket rankings, and the England team, whose aggregated results over the last few years had it standing second in the rankings. Despite Australia this time having the advantage of playing on its own soil, the England team that had wrested the Ashes from the Australians was expected to be highly competitive.

In the First Test in Brisbane , Ponting top-scored in Australia's first innings with 196 runs, and he followed this up with 60 not out in the second as Australia took the initiative with a commanding win. In the Second Test in Adelaide , Ponting top-scored with 142, helping Australia to a total of 513 in response to England's 6/551. Australia went on to win the match by six wickets after a last day English collapse, Ponting making 49 in the chase. At the conclusion of the match, Ponting's batting average peaked at 59.99. The Third Test played at the WACA Ground saw another win to Australia by 206 runs to reclaim the Ashes; Ponting made 2 and 75. The 15 months they had been in English hands was the shortest period either nation had held the urn. Further wins in Melbourne and Sydney, made Ponting's team the second team (after Warwick Armstrong 's Australian team in 1920–21) to win an Ashes series 5–0, and that against what had been thought to be a formidable team, the second strongest cricketing team in the world. Ricky Ponting was awarded Man of the Series for the 2006–07 Ashes series after scoring 576 runs at an average of 82.29 including 2 centuries and 2 half centuries.
Australia then started the ODI series well, qualifying in first place for the final. However, they stumbled and lost 2–0 to England in the finals. Ponting was then rested for the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy ahead of the World Cup, and in his absence, the Australians were whitewashed 3–0, leading to suggestions that his team had slumped just ahead of the most important ODI tournament in world cricket.
Australia left for St Vincent, Australia's venue for its two warm-up matches against Zimbabwe and England on 28 February without Brett Lee because of ankle damage. In the first warmup game against Zimbabwe, Ponting scored just 2 in Australia's 106 run victory. [169] In Australia's second and last warm up game, this time against England, Ponting again failed to make an impact, scoring just 7 before he was bowled by off-spinner Jamie Dalrymple . [170]
Australia started its World Cup campaign with three group matches played at Warner Park , St Kitts . Ponting himself began successfully with an innings of 113 from 93 deliveries that included five sixes, as Australia were dominant in 203-run victory against Scotland. Despite scoring just 23 in the next match against the Netherlands, Australia still amassed 358 and proceeded to win by 229 runs. In their next match against South Africa, Australia amassed 377/6—their highest score in World Cups. Ponting also scored 91 from 91 balls, and became the seventh player to score 10,000 ODI runs. Despite South Africa being 160 without loss in the 21st over, they crumbled, losing 9 wickets for just 74 runs. [171] [172]
A large crowd of over 10,000 fans welcome the Australian team on completing the first World Cup hat-trick – Martin Place, Sydney.
Australia comfortably qualified for the Super Eights with their first match played at the new Antigua Recreation Ground in Antigua . Ponting stated that he was not very impressed with the outfield labelling it "ridiculously sandy". The Australian captain was run out when on 35, with his team amassing 322 mainly thanks to 158 from Hayden. In a match spread out over two days, Australia comfortably defeated the home side by 103 runs. [173] In their next match, Australia come up against lowly Bangladesh in another rain interrupted affair. This time the match was shortened to 22 overs a side. In the end Australia won by 10 wickets with Ponting not getting a chance to bat. [174] In their next match against England, again in Antigua, Ponting scored a half-century, guiding Australia to a seven-wicket victory. [175] After not getting a bat in Australia's rout of Ireland in Barbados, Ponting steered Australia to victory in their next match against Sri Lanka in Grenada, with 66 not out. Grenada was again the venue for Australia's final super eights match, this time against New Zealand. Again amongst the runs, Ponting produced a fluent 66 that included seven boundaries, with his team wrapping up their biggest victory of the tournament. With his men now firm favourites for the tournament, they again came up against South Africa in the semi-final. South Africa, who were reeling at 27/5, ended up setting Australia 150 to win. Although Ponting 22, Australia easily dispatched South Africa by 7 wickets.
Sydney Test controversy[ edit ]
Main articles: Sri Lankan cricket team in Australia in 2007–08 , 2007–08 Chappell–Hadlee Trophy and Indian cricket team in Australia in 2007–08
The 2007–08 started a new era for Australia, as McGrath and Warne had both retired at the end of the previous Ashes series. The pair had taken more than 1250 Test wickets between them, and the only three Test defeats that Australia had suffered under Ponting, once against India in Mumbai in 2004 and the two against England in 2005, had all occurred when one of the two were injured. Now that both had gone, critics wondered whether Australia and Ponting could maintain their success with their two main strike weapons absent. Australia had not played a Test since the Ashes, while being involved in 32 ODIs and eight Twenty20 Internationals. [176] The period started well for Australia; winning the first Test against Sri Lanka in Brisbane by an innings and 40 runs. Ponting struck 56 from 84 balls (seven fours) in Australia's total of 551. The Second Test in Hobart, saw Ponting score 31 (66 balls) and 53 not out (2 fours and a six) in front of his home crowd, as Australia wrapped up the series 2–0. Ponting scored 140 runs at 70 and took three catches. [177]

However, the series against India was much harder-fought. Australia won the First Test easily, by 337 runs, but the matches thereafter were more difficult. The Second Test was closely fought and ended in Australian victory minutes before the end of play. This saw Australia equal the world record of 16 consecutive Test wins; Ponting, was part of Steve Waugh side that set the previous record in 1999–2001. However, the cricket was overshadowed by player conduct issues.
After the match ended the stadium erupted in cheering as the Indians walked off the field, and the Australians celebrated their record-equalling win. [178] The Australian team did not shake hands with Indian Players on the field, especially Kumble who was waiting there after the fall of the final wicket. [179] Though the Australian and Indian teams shook hands before heading into the dressing rooms later, but Kumble, who was batting at the end of the match, showed his displeasure by not shaking hands with the umpires. India expressed their resentment by boycotting the post-match presentation ceremony. In the post-match press conference, Anil Kumble summed up his view of the game by stating, "Only one team is playing in the spirit of the game" – a statement that alluded to Australian captain Bill Woodfull 's leaked private admonishment of English manager Sir Pelham Warner during the 1932/33 Bodyline series . Chetan Chauhan , India's team manager said his players were "agitated and upset by... the incompetent umpires here... [and hoped] that they will not officiate again in the series". Ponting was questioned over the wrong decision, the racism row, and especially the wicket of Ganguly during which he held his finger up to indicate to Mark Benson that Ganguly has been caught. Ponting was aggressive towards the Indian journalists, lashing out at them for "questioning my [Ponting's] integrity". The Australian players faced much questioning as a result of the fallout of the incident. The Australian team maintained that they play hard but fair. In regards to the racism issue, Ponting denied he did anything wrong by singularly reporting Harbhajan Singh for being abusive. Ponting stated that he was obligated to refer any incidents of racism to officials as it is widely agreed that racism is unacceptable anywhere in the world. [180] After criticism of the Australian team in multiple media continued, a shocked Ponting promised to ensure that his side's conduct is not seen to be arrogant in future matches. [181] Peter Roebuck , a columnist in The Sydney Morning Herald , branded Ponting as "arrogant" and insisted that be stripped of the captaincy. [182]
In the early part of the Test series against India, Ponting continued to struggle against Harbhajan, falling to him three consecutive times in the first two Tests. On the third occasion, Ponting was again caught at bat pad, from the first ball that Harbhajan bowled to him, prompting the bowler to celebrate raucously. Harbhajan missed the Third Test and upon his return in the fourth Test, Ponting broke through for his first Test century against India in matches involving Harbhajan, scoring 140. However, the second half of the series was less successful for Australia as a team; India won the Third Test, ending the Australian streak, and the Fourth Test was a high-scoring draw. The Adelaide Test aside, Ponting had an otherwise unproductive season, scoring 268 runs at 38.28.
In the Commonwealth Bank series, Ponting struggled until Australia's last round robin match against India where he and another poor performing Australian batsmen, Andrew Symonds put on a 100 run partnership with Ponting making a hundred and Symonds making 50. Australia won two of their three round robin matches against the Indians, but the tables were turned in the finals, which the tourists won 2–0.
Third Australian to score 10,000 Test runs[ edit ]
Main article: Australian cricket team in the West Indies in 2008
The tour of the West Indies was the first overseas Test series for Australia in 25 months, and the first for Ponting's new look bowling attack. [183] In five previous Test series in 1999 and 2003, he averaged 98.71, with four hundreds. He also averaged 42.80 in 25 ODIs from four tours—1995, 1999, 2003 and the 2007 World Cup. [184] After eight months of consecutive cricket from the World Twenty20, Ponting was surprised about how good he was feeling, despite believing that he would be weary from the amount of cricket he had played. [185] In the only warm up match before the series—against a Jamaican XI, [186] the Australians drew controversy from various sections of the media as they chose to wear a sponsors cap over the traditional Baggy Green cap. This was because wicket–keeper Brad Haddin did not want to receive a Baggy Green as he was yet to play in a Test. The rest of the team decided they wanted to look uniform although they wore their Baggy Greens in Jamaica's second innings. [187] [188] [189] Ponting scored 17 in the first innings and 20 not out in the second, as a storm prevented an Australian victory. [190]
After winning the toss and electing to bat in the First Test in Kingston, Jamaica , Ponting recorded his 35th Test century and was eventually dismissed for 158 from 224 balls. [191] Despite forcing their way back into contention, the West Indies were defeated by 95 runs. [192] In the Second Test, Ponting became the seventh player and third Australian to score 10,000 Test runs. It took Ponting 118 Tests and 196 innings to achieve the feat, one slower than Tendulkar and Lara. He was dismissed in the following over for 65. [193] Ponting scored 38 in Australia's second innings, as the match ended in a draw. [194] Australia won the third Test, [195] and the Australian captain ended the series with 323 runs at 53.83. [196] Although Australia won the three–Test series handsomely, with a 2–0 margin, they were to face stronger opposition overseas, in the next year. Difficulties were also beginning to appear in the spin department. MacGill, who had taken over 200 wickets in his career despite playing only sporadically due to the presence of Warne, suffered a loss of form and decided to retire during the series. Brad Hogg , the regular ODI spinner had also retired prior to the series, and Beau Casson made his debut in the final Test. [197] [198]
After not batting in Australia's Twenty20 loss in Bridgetown , Ponting was rested for the List A 50-over game against the University of West Indies Vice Chancellor's XI. [199] He returned for the first three ODIs and scored just 87 runs at 29.00, notching up his 300th ODI during the 2nd match. [200] [201] Ponting scored 69 in the third match, before returning home because of a wrist injury. Under the captaincy of Michael Clarke in the final two games, Australia swept the series 5–0. [202]
2008–2011: Decline in form[ edit ]
Mixed team performances[ edit ]
Main articles: Australian cricket team in India in 2008 , Ricky Ponting with the Australian cricket team in India in 2008–09 , South African cricket team in Australia in 2008–09 , New Zealand cricket team in Australia in 2008–09 and Australian cricket team in South Africa in 2008–09
In 2008, Ponting led the Australians back to India and was under pressure following the confrontations during the Indian tour of Australia earlier in the year. He acknowledged that he was keen to rectify his poor Test batting record in India. In the First Test on a turning pitch in Bangalore, [203] [204] Ponting brought up his first Test century in India, 123 on the first day, although he eventually fell leg before wicket to Harbhajan. Australia had the hosts seven wickets down in their first innings, still more than 320 runs in arrears, but India recovered to salvage a draw after a rearguard effort. [205] [206] [207]
In the Second Test in Mohali. Australia were defeated by 320 runs and Ponting was criticised for using part-timer bowlers against the free-scoring Indian batsmen in the second innings, because of a slow over-rate, which is can be penalised by a fine, or in severe instances, a ban to the captain. This meant that he was not able to use pace spearhead Brett Lee significantly.
The Third Test in Delhi saw a flat pitch, where India scored 7/613 in its first innings in which Ponting resorted to bowling himself for two overs. Ponting amassed 87 in Australia's first innings score of 577. The match ended in a draw and Australia needed to win in the Fourth Test in Nagpur to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. [208] On the fourth afternoon of the Fourth Test, the Indian batting collapsed, and Australia had an opportunity to bowl them out and chase a target of around 250–300 after the tea break. [209] However, the Australians were a long way behind on their over rate , so in order to avoid a one match suspension, Ponting chose to bowl their part-time spinners and medium pacers such as Michael Clarke , Cameron White and Mike Hussey (who were all unsuccessful in capturing a wicket), as they took less time. In the meantime, captain MS Dhoni and Harbhajan both added half centuries. This drew strong criticism from many commentators , who suggested that their Faster bowlers , who had been responsible for the collapse, could have bowled from a shorter run-up. When the fast bowlers were reintroduced, the last four wickets fell quickly. This left Australia chasing 382 runs for victory and they lost by 172 runs to cede the series 2–0. In the first innings, Ponting became Harbhajan's 300th Test wicket and the Australian captain ended the series with 264 runs at 37.71. While below his career standards, it was substantially better than his previous Test efforts in India.
Fined in India for a slow over rate, Ponting failed to redress the matter during the subsequent home series against New Zealand , when match referee Chris Broad dealt a second successive fine for being three overs behind in the First Test: Ponting was stripped of thirty per cent of his A$12,750 match fee, twice the punishment of his team-mates in accordance with International Cricket Council rules for captains. [210] Australia were largely untroubled by New Zealand, sweeping both Tests. Ponting scored only 100 runs at 33.33.
Ponting with Brad Haddin (left) and Nathan Hauritz (right) in the Third and final Test against South Africa in Sydney, January 2009
In the first Test against South Africa in Perth, starting in December, Ponting again had to reduce his reliance on his preferred pace bowlers, and rely more on spinners due to a slow over rate. His persistent problems with the over rate prompted some commentators to criticise him for spending too much time during the match conferring with bowlers. In the first innings he scored a duck, and managed 32 in Australia's second innings. Ponting's inexperienced attack had trouble dismissing the opposition batsmen, and South Africa made 4/414, the second highest successful runchase in history to win by six wickets on the final day. [211]
Ponting experienced a form slump for much of 2008, albeit in comparison to his usually high standards. However, he again exceeded 1,000 runs in the calendar year. Ponting scored his 37th century in the first innings of the Second Test against South Africa on Boxing Day, and followed that with 99 in the second innings, seemingly a lone stand against the South African bowling attack. [212] [213] The tourists won the match by nine wickets to win the series. Australia thus lost their first home Test series since 1992–93. [214] Australia lost the series 2–1, the first time South Africa had won a Test series against Australian since 1970, and the first on Australian soil. Ponting totalled 285 runs at 47.50 for the series.
With the retirement of experienced opening batsman Matthew Hayden—who was replaced by the uncapped 20-year-old Phillip Hughes —the Australian team that toured South Africa in February, March and April 2009 was its most inexperienced since the defections to World Series Cricket . This was further compounded by the loss of Andrew Symonds to injury, who was replaced by the uncapped Marcus North . The bowling attack also required major changes, due to the injuries to Brett Lee and Stuart Clark . Subsequently, paceman Mitchell Johnson was the only bowler with more than four Tests heading into the series. Of the First Test team, Hughes, North, Ben Hilfenhaus , Peter Siddle and Andrew McDonald had only five Tests between them, with the former three making their debut. [215] Ponting's team took the series 2–1, so Australia maintained their No. 1 Test ranking. Ponting was praised for cobbling together an unexpected win, as South Africa were thought to be stronger on home soil. He scored eighties in the first two Tests, ending with 210 runs at 35.00.
Second Ashes series loss as captain[ edit ]

After losing their opening match of the 2007 World Twenty20 to Zimbabwe, Ponting's men were looking for a more positive start to the 2009 edition in England. They opened their campaign in early June against a West Indian outfit that had recently been whitewashed 2–0 in the Test series against England. However, Ponting made a second ball duck in Australia's seven wicket defeat. [216] [217] They played Sri Lanka in their next match, this time at Trent Bridge in Nottingham . Ponting hit five boundaries on his 25 before he was bowled trying the run-rate, before Sri Lanka won by six wickets. The defeat consequently eliminated Australia from the tournament. [218]
In Australia's two drawn warm-up matches ahead of the 2009 Ashes , Ponting struggled to adjust to the English conditions, somewhat, with a highest score of 71. [219] [220] [220] Nevertheless, he started the Ashes series strongly, scoring 150 in the First Test in Cardiff . In his 38th hundred and eighth in an Ashes series, the Australian number three batsman became just the fourth man to score 11,000 runs in Test cricket. [221] The match ended in a draw and Ponting drew criticism for failing to bowl fast-bowler Ben Hilfenhaus while England's last-wicket pair of Monty Panesar and Jimmy Anderson were batting to save the match. [222] Ponting could only manage two and 38, as Australia were defeated in the second Test at Lords —their first Test defeat at the venue since 1934. On 31 July, during the Third Test at Edgbaston , Ponting became the highest Australian run-scorer in the history of Test cricket, overtaking former Australian captain Allan Border 's total of 11,174 in his first-innings score of 38. The match was eventually drawn, partly due to poor weather.
... It takes three ingredients to make a great player – determination, courage and skill – and he's got all three in abundance. He's also developed into a great leader. Players really enjoy playing for him and that's sometimes a difficult trait to bring out in people. You can tell by the way the team respond to him that his leadership skills are among the finest. Combine this with his batting skill and that's a pretty intimidating package.
— Allan Border [223]
Ponting fielding during First Test in Cardiff
Australia went onto lose the series 2–1 and Ponting became only the third Australian captain to lose the Ashes twice. Despite not being a selector, Ponting was heavily criticised for Australia not playing Hauritz and his apparent reluctance to put faith in his spinners. He was questioned, particularly on Australia's recent habit of often not playing a specialist/regular spinner. Instances of these were the first three Tests in India, the omission of Krejza for the First Test against New Zealand immediately after taking 12 wickets on debut, and opting for no spinner in the first two Tests in South Africa. [224]
On 7 September 2009, Ponting announced his retirement from Twenty20 international cricket in order to prolong his career. [225] [226] He was succeeded as Australian Twenty20 captain by team vice-captain Michael Clarke .
Australia came into the Champions Trophy ranked second in ODIs; along with being the events reigning champions. [227] They opened their campaign against an undermanned West Indian outfit who were without prominent players because of an industrial dispute. [228] On a "lively pitch", Ponting top-scored with 79, after reaching his half-century in 63 balls. He hit opening bowler and future nemesis, Kemar Roach , for four boundaries in the seventh over of the match, and scored a six and two fours against the fast-bowler when he was reintroduced into the attack in the 21st over. The innings set up Australia's comfortable 50-run victory. [229] Australia next match against India was abandoned due to rain. Before the weather intervend Ponting had scored 65 from 85 deliveries, before being run out. The result meant Australia needed to defeat Pakistan in their third and final group match for a place in the semi-finals. Though Australia collapsed when Ponting was dismissed for a patient 32 in pursuit of low total they won by two wickets. [230] [231] [232]
Australia defeated England by nine wickets in their semi-final, with Ponting scoring an unbeaten 111 from 115 deliveries (12 fours and one six); his 28th ODI century. During the innings, Ponting became the third batsman to score 12,000 ODI runs and was also involved in a record 252-run partnership with Watson—Ponting's seventh double-century stand for Australia in the format; the only player to achieve this feat. [233] [234] Despite Ponting's score of only one in the final in Centurion against New Zealand, Australia won the by six wickets—their second consecutive Champions Trophy victory. [235] [236] Ponting was presented with the golden bat award for most runs in the tournament—288 at an average of 72 in four games—and also received the man-of-the-series award, before praising his young side for the title defence. [237]
Australia proceeded to tour India for seven ODIs starting in mid-October and ending in early November. In the opening match, Ponting top-scored for Australia with 74 from 85 balls, as his team narrowly escaped defeat. [66] [238] Ponting made just 12 in India's comprehensive victory in the second match, while he scored a slow 59 from 93 balls (four boundaries) in another Indian victory in the third match. [66] [239] [240] The Australian captain stuck a more fluent innings of 52, scored in 59 deliveries in the following fixture. [66] Australia amassed their biggest total of the series in the fifth match, with Ponting contributing a run-a-ball 45. A slow, low, turning wicket was presented to the teams for the sixth ODI in Guwahati . Ponting fought his way to 25 from 57 balls, before falling to Harbhajan, as Australia comfortably chased down India's total of 170 with six wickets remaining. [66] [241] [242] The final match in Mumbai was washed out after a cyclone formed over the Arabian Sea ; securing a 4–2 series victory to the injury depleted Australians. [243] "It's probably one of the best one-day series I have ever been involved in, with all the injuries and setbacks at the start of this tour", Ponting said. [244] He ending the series with 267 runs at 44.50. [75]
Troubles against the short ball[ edit ]

Ponting scored the first ever double-century (209) at his home ground Bellerive Oval (pictured) in the Third Test against Pakistan.
Leading West Indian batsmen Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul returned for the opening Test of the 2009–10 Australian cricket season starting on 26 November in Brisbane, after the industrial dispute was resolved. Ponting scored 55 in an Australian innings victory, [64] [245] before many sections of the media attacked the West Indies lack-lustre performance. [246] Ponting produced scores of 35 and 20 in the following Test in Adelaide, as the touring side responded to their critics by securing a draw. [64] [245] For the first time since 2002, Ponting slid out of the top ten Test batting rankings—dropping to 12th—as Australia faced the prospect of falling to third in the team rankings if they were not able to achieve victory in the final Test of the series. [247] Matters got worse for Ponting, as former Australian fast-bowler Rodney Hogg voiced that he should be sacked as captain and replaced with New South Wales leader Simon Katich. He said the team had become a "boys club" and was not preparing adequately for the future. [248] However, former Australian Test opening batsman Justin Langer labelled Hogg's comments as "rubbish", something that was backed by Katich.
In the first innings of the Third and final Test, Ponting was immediately greeted with short pitched bowling. After mis-timing a pull-shot from Roach on his first ball, Ponting was struck on the elbow from the following delivery. After battling through obvious discomfort, Ponting eventually retired hurt on 23 from 25 balls—the only time he had taken such action in his international career. Nevertheless, he did manage to hit two fours and a six from short deliveries in Roach's 12th over. [249] [250] Michael Clarke replaced Ponting at his number three batting position, as the Australia captain did not want to risk further damage to his elbow tendon injury ahead of the Boxing Day Test against Pakistan in Melbourne. Nevertheless, Australia collapsed and he eventually came to the wicket at number nine, with Australia at 7/125. The West Indian bowlers once again bowled short deliverers to Ponting until he turned one such delivery to short-leg and was dismissed for two. [251]

After spending time in a hyperbaric chamber to increase the speed of his recovery from the elbow injury, [252] Ponting recovered sufficiently to play in the Boxing Day Test, the opening match of a three-Test series against Pakistan. Despite still being inconvenienced by the injury, [253] he scored 57 at close to a run-a-ball, [64] before being dismissed by another short pitched delivery for 12 in Australia's second innings. [253] The home side went on to win the match comfortably, and Ponting overtook Shane Warne's record of 91 Test victories and surpassing Steve Waugh as crickets most successful Test captain. [254] Ponting scored 853 runs at 38.77 in 13 Tests in 2009, and scored only one century and seven half-centuries. [255] Nevertheless, his ODI form was more convincing, topping the run-scoring list with MS Dhoni. His 1,198 runs were scored at an average of 42.78, including two centuries and nine half-centuries in 29 matches. [256] Ponting was criticised for choosing to bat on a green pitch for the Second Test. Australia were dismissed for 127, and Ponting was once again dismissed from a short ball, this time for a first-ball duck, and many sections of the media called for him to stop playing the hook and pull shots. He fell for only 11 in the second innings, and when Australia lost their eighth wicket, they were only just over 50 ahead. However, a 123-run ninth-wicket partnership between Michael Hussey and Peter Siddle rescued the home-side, helping them win by 36 runs. After being dropped on zero, Ponting scored his fifth double-century in the Third and final Test in Hobart. His innings helped Australia complete a 3–0 series victory.
In the following five ODIs, Ponting could not continue his Hobart form, scoring 125 runs at 25 in the series, boosted by a half-century in the final match. Though, his performances improved in the five ODIs starting soon after against the West Indies. He was named man-of-the-series thanks to his 295 runs at 73.75, including two-half centuries and his 29th and first ODI century in Brisbane during the fourth match.
2010–11 Ashes defeat[ edit ]
Australia entered the 2010–11 Ashes series hoping to regain The Ashes from England on home soil as they had four years previously. The First Test in Brisbane was drawn after both sides posted large batting totals. Ponting was caught behind for 10 in the first innings and 51 not out in the second. [257] A barren run followed in the subsequent three Tests, scoring 52 runs in total as Australia lost the series. [258] During the Fourth Test Ponting was involved in an on-field argument with umpires, [259] and was fined 40% of his match fee, which accounted to around $5,400. [260] Ponting missed the Fifth Test due to a finger injury, and Michael Clarke stood in as Australia's captain. [261] Australia's heavy defeat in the series and Ponting's poor run of form caused his position in the team to be questioned. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh suggested dropping him down the batting order; [261] others, such as former Australian batsman and South African captain Kepler Wessels , called for him to relinquish the captaincy to focus on his batting. [262]
2011 World Cup and resignation as captain[ edit ]
Ponting retained the captaincy of Australia for the 2011 World Cup in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Australia had won the previous three World Cups and entered the tournament as the world's top-ranked ODI team. Australia qualified for the quarter-finals, although Ponting failed to find form, scoring 102 runs in five innings during the group stage of the tournament. [263] Australia met India in the quarter-finals and were defeated by five wickets. [264] Ponting . He made his debut in the opening match of the series, on 24 July 2013, and was crucial in setting up an Indian win. He made 63* and in partnership with his captain, Virat Kohli, who made a century, helped India win. He became the 12th Indian batsman to score a half-century on his ODI debut. He was also a part of India's squads to South Africa in 2013, New Zealand in 2014, Asia Cup 2014 and 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh .Rayudu scored a crucial 58 vs Pakistan in the Asia cup but struggled against Bangladesh in a series where he scored only 18 runs in 3 matches.
Rayudu was a part of 17 man squad for the Royal London One Day Series against England in July 2014. He played in the 3rd ODI where he picked up the wicket of England captain Alastair Cook and made a crucial 64 not out with the bat.
On 6 November 2014 Rayudu made his first one-day international century against srilanka by hitting 121* coming to bat at no 3.
On 10 july 2015 he made his second ton by hitting 124* against zimbabwe.Wicketkeeper-batsman Sanju Samson was on 13 july 2015 named as a replacement for injured Ambati Rayudu for the remainder of India’s tour of Zimbabwe.
2015 World Cup[ edit ]
Rayudu was selected in India's 15-member squad for the cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, beginning in February 2015 [8]
Indian Cricket League (2007–2009)[ edit ]
Ambati Rayudu joined ICL , a rebel group to Indian Domestic Cricket, on 16 August 2007 with six other players from Hyderabad Cricket Association. BCCI was shocked over this surprising event and had geared up to convene on 21 August 2007. After his association with the ICL, he was dropped from the state team, but he continued to play in the ICL for Hyderabad Heroes .
Indian Premier League (2010–present)[ edit ]
Rayudu was with the Mumbai Indians in IPL 2010 as a middle order batsman/part-time wicketkeeper. His performance won many positive reviews from the critics and he was touted as a big name to be watched in the next IPL season. Being classified as an uncapped player, Rayudu was not a part of the IPL 2011 auction. Immediately after the auction, Siddhartha Mallya, Team Director of Royal Challengers Bangalore and son of RCB's owner Vijay Mallya flew to Vadodara and was seen meeting Rayudu during the Ranji Trophy final between Rajasthan and Baroda. The exact nature of the talks was unknown, but it was speculated that Rayudu rejected the offer. Mumbai Indians, who gave Rayudu a second chance after coming back from the ICL, bagged him for the 2011 season of IPL . He had another impressive season that year, scoring 395 runs in 16 matches, including 4 half-centuries. He scored a six of the last ball of the last league match against Kolkata Knight Riders to win the game on 22 May 2011, when a boundary was required. James Franklin was crucial in setting up Rayudu's last ball heroics by scoring 4 boundaries in that over and a single off of the 5th ball to give Rayudu the strike. The bowler on the receiving end of this was Lakshmipathy Balaji .

Career[ edit ]
Uthappa first came to the public's attention when he made 66 for India B against India A in the Challenger Trophy in 2005. The following year, in the same tournament, Uthappa made match-winning 93-ball 100 against the same team which propelled him in the big league. Previously, he had been a member of the India Under-19 team that won the Asia Cup. Once a wicket-keeper batsman, his List A batting average of near 40 with a strike rate of approximately 90 has made him regarded as something of a limited overs cricket specialist.
He was recalled to the ODI side in January 2007 for the series against the West Indies. He did not feature in the first two games. He scored a quick 70 in the third game followed by a quickfire 28 in the fourth game.
He was selected in the 15-member squad of the Indian team for the 2007 Cricket World Cup held in the West Indies in March–April 2007. He played in all three group games, but only scored 30 runs in total as India suffered a shock defeat to Bangladesh and a loss to Sri Lanka resulting in the team not qualifying for the Super 8 stage.
In the sixth ODI of the NatWest Series 2007–2008, he scored 47 off 33 balls to take India to a thrilling victory, keeping Indian hopes alive in the 7- match series which they were trailing 2–3 before the match. Used to batting as an opener, in this match he came in at the unfamiliar position of no 7. When he came at the crease India were 5 down for 234 after 40.2 overs, still needing 83 from less than 10 overs. After Dhoni got out in the 47th over with the Indian score at 294, Uthappa kept a cool head to take India to the target with two balls to spare in a remarkable victory.
Uthappa also scored a crucial 50 against Pakistan in the 20–20 World Cup in South Africa, when India were tottering at 39/4. With this, he became the first Indian to score a 50 in a 20–20 International match. [2] India subsequently won the match in bowl out 3–0, where he bowled one of the three deliveries that hit the stumps.
After his impressive performance in the seventh season of IPL , he was selected to captain the India A team for its tour of Australia in July 2013. [3]
In November 2014, Robin was included into Indian One Day International squad for the last two matches against Sri Lanka.
Robin was included in 30 men Indian squad for 2015 Cricket World Cup . [4] Robin Uthappa was also included in team India which toured Zimbabwe in 2015
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
Uthappa played for Mumbai Indians in the 2008 Indian Premier League and had a fairly successful opening season. In his very first match he scored 48 runs from 38 balls against Royal Challengers Bangalore . In the next game, against Chennai Super Kings , he made 43 (36) including 6 fours and a six. Against Kolkata Knight Riders , he stitched an unbeaten 123-run partnership with Dwayne Bravo , where he scored a run-a-ball 37 to steer Mumbai to an easy win. Then he scored 34 off just 21 deliveries to lead Mumbai to an emphatic victory over the in-form Rajasthan Royals . However, a quickfire 23-ball 46 from Uthappa went in vain after Delhi Daredevils clinched a 5-wicket win in a nail-biting finish.
In January 2009, he was swapped with Zaheer Khan and moved to Royal Challengers Bangalore . He had a disappointing 2009 season of IPL for the Royal Challengers. His only noteworthy innings came against the Mumbai Indians in a match where he struck 66* off 42 balls to guide the RCB run-chase.
In a match against Kings XI Punjab in 2010 Indian Premier League he smashed a 21-ball 51, the second fastest fifty in Indian Premier League and was instrumental in setting up the win for the Royal Challengers. He came up with another match-winning innings, against Chennai Super Kings , as he struck an unbeaten 68 off just 38 balls. He also won the Man of the match award for this effort. Against Kolkata Knight Riders , he scored an unbeaten 50 from only 22 deliveries to take the Challengers to another comfortable win. He ended the season with 374 runs from 14 innings at an average of 31.16. He also hit 27 sixes, which was the most by any batsman in that season.
For the 2011 Indian Premier League he was bought by Pune Warriors for a huge sum of 2.1 million USD (approximately INR 9.4 crores) in the auction held at Bangalore . He was the second most expensive player in that auction behind Gautam Gambhir , who was bought for 2.4 million USD by Kolkata Knight Riders .

Even though IPL 5 was a disappknow the rest of the leadership team's opinion, you need to be committed 100 per cent." [34] As a further punishment for his misadventure, Symonds was not selected for the Australian tour to India in October 2008.
After Australia lost the test series in India two-nil, Symonds was recalled for the test series against New Zealand in November 2008. [35] He did not play any significant role in the first test, which Australia won. After the test, on 22 November, Symonds was reported to have been involved in a pub brawl with another patron who had attempted to hug him and have his photo taken with the cricketer. He was subsequently cleared by Cricket Australia to play in the second test. [36] He then played in the first two tests of the next series against South Africa but performed poorly and was omitted from the team for the third test due to injury; at the same time, many critics called for his omission on performance grounds.
In January 2009, Symonds gave an interview with sports comedians Roy & HG , in which he made remarks about the acquisition of New Zealand cricketer Brendon McCullum by the New South Wales Blues to play in the KFC Twenty20 final against Victoria, despite McCullum's not having played at all for the Blues previously. Sounding intoxicated, Symonds called McCullum a "lump of shit", and declared that having dinner at the home of team-mate Matthew Hayden was enjoyable because he could glance at Hayden's wife. The interview led to his being charged with violating the Cricket Australia code of conduct. Following a hearing with general manager Michael Brown, he was fined $4,000, instructed to work with a psychologist, and indefinitely barred from selection until he was deemed to have been successfully rehabilitated. [37]
In the meantime Symonds continued to play for Queensland, but was not selected by Australia, missing three five-match series against South Africa, New Zealand and South Africa respectively. He was finally recalled in April to play ODIs against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, [38] but was not selected for the 2009 Ashes squad, with young all-rounders Shane Watson , Andrew McDonald and Marcus North being preferred. [39]
In early June 2009, Symonds was sent home from the ICC World Twenty20 tournament in England following "an alcohol-related incident". [40] Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland called a press conference to announce Symonds' dismissal, which marked the end of his international cricket career. [3] His Cricket Australia contract was also reviewed [41] and later cancelled. [2]
In June 2009, Symonds told Channel Nine 's Sixty Minutes that he was not an alcoholic but a binge-drinker . "I go out and drink hard all in one hit — too fast, too much", he said. [42]
Rugby League[ edit ]
Symonds has been a keen supporter of the Brisbane Broncos since childhood and was considering a switch to rugby league in 2002 when his cricket career was faltering, but ultimately decided to stay in cricket. [43] On 21 June 2009 he played a game for the Wynnum Manly Seagulls against an all star team featuring some noted players including Marcus Bai and Steve Renouf . He has also trained with the Brisbane Broncos in the past. In 2011 he played in the inaugural 'Legend of Origin' match to support victims of the Queensland floods. He played for Queensland alongside such league legends as Gorden Tallis , Wendell Sailor , Mat Rogers and Mal Meninga [44]
Appearance in reality shows[ edit ]
Big Boss Season 5 (India)[ edit ]
Symonds was the first International Cricketer after Vinod Kambli to enter the Bigg Boss house. He made a wild card entry into the show. As speaking in English was strictly prohibited in the house, Pooja Misrra , one of the most controversial Indian contestants of Bigg Boss acted as a translator for Symonds. [45] [46] [47] [48] [49]
Movies (India)[ edit ]
He played himself in the 2011 Bollywood movie Patiala House , in which Akshay Kumar played the leading role. [50]

Football goalkeeper[ edit ]
Bucknor played as a goalkeeper in Jamaican parish leagues in the 1960s. In 1964 he played in goal for Jamaica in a schoolboy international versus Brazil , which Jamaica drew 1-1. [3]
Football referee[ edit ]
Bucknor was a FIFA referee in a CONCACAF and World Cup qualifier between El Salvador and the Netherlands Antilles in 1988 .
Cricket umpire[ edit ]
Bucknor's first international cricket fixture was a One Day International (ODI) between the West Indies and India at Antigua on 18 March 1989. His first Test match was at Sabina Park , Kingston, Jamaica, between 28 April and 3 May 1989, with the competing teams again being the West Indies and India. After umpiring in a few international matches, he was selected to umpire at the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia, and went on to stand in the final despite being quite inexperienced. [4] Bucknor also stood in the next four World Cup finals in 1996, 1999, 2003 and 2007, with the 2007 World Cup taking place in his native West Indies.
In 1994 the ICC introduced a policy whereby one of the umpires in each Test match would be independent of the competing nations, selected from the International Panel of Umpires. Bucknor was a member of this panel from its foundation until the ICC changed its policy on umpires again in 2002. Since then both umpires in Test matches, and one of the umpires in ODI's have been independent of the competing countries. The officials are now chosen from the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires , whom the ICC consider to be the world's best umpires. Bucknor maintained a place on the Elite Panel since its foundation until his retirement.
In May 2006, he accused TV companies of doctoring their images to make umpires look bad and key players look good. [5] He was one of five officials, responsible for the wrong decision in the 2007 World Cup final, resulting in play continuing in poor light. [6] Consequently, all five officials were suspended from the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa. [7] Dave Richardson, the general manager of cricket at the ICC, has said Bucknors umpiring accuracy was at 96% during 2005-06, [8] above the average of 94.8% for the Elite Panel. In 2007, he was short-listed for the Umpire of the Year award, which was ultimately won by Simon Taufel. [9] Things turned progressively worse in the following months, when he was removed by the ICC from officiating in the third Test between Australia and India in Perth after his several incorrect decisions contributed to India's defeat in the second Test in Sydney in January 2008 & he was replaced by Billy Bowden for the third Test match. [10] Former umpire Dickie Bird suggested that Bucknor had "gone on too long", [11] while Bucknor blamed India's financial power for his ouster. [12] [13]
The ICC confirmed on 23 February 2009 that Bucknor had decided to retire from umpiring in March 2009. His final Test match was the 3rd Test between South Africa and Australia at Cape Town on 19–23 March, and his last One Day International match was the 4th ODI between his native West Indies and England at Barbados on 29 March, bringing his 20 year career as an official to an end. [14]
Achievements as an umpire[ edit ]
Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
Bucknor has stood as an onfield umpire in five World Cup tournaments, during which he has officiated 44 matches including five finals.
Test match record[ edit ]
Bucknor holds the record for the most Test matches umpired, and was the first umpire to have officiated in over 100 Test matches (he was later joined in this distinction by Rudi Koertzen ). He has stood in 14 Ashes Test matches and officiated in Bangladesh's first ever Test match.
One day internationals[ edit ]
Bucknor has officiated in the second highest number of ODIs, with Rudi Koertzen the only umpire to have stood in more ODIs.
Awards[ edit ]
Bucknor ational against England at Old Trafford Cricket Ground , Manchester in August 2011. He scored a half-century on this match (61 of 49) against an England attack comprising Stuart Broad , Graeme Swann and Tim Bresnan . The match was the only T20I played by former Indian captain Rahul Dravid .
Rahane was part of Indian team make it to the final of 2014 World T20 . After sitting on the bench for the first 3 matches he got a chance to play against Australia where he scored 19 runs. He gave India a good start in the semi final scoring 32 runs as India went on to win the Match.He also captained India in the 2 Twenty20 International against Zimbabwe , winning the first and losing the second match.He scored 33 and 4 runs in those matches. [33]
IPL career[ edit ]
Rahane was widely regarded as not being a Twenty20 player going into 2012 Indian Premier League , but had a superb season for Rajasthan Royals . Previously he was in the Mumbai Indians squads and got limited opportunities. [9] And then, he caught the eye of Rajasthan Royals’ Shane Watson , who had watched him score an 80-ball hundred in a session in the second innings of a three-day game against Australia A in 2010. Having bought him from the Mumbai Indians, Rahul Dravid and Watson got Rahane to open the innings. “Opening the batting with Rahul bhai gave me a chance to express myself and showcase all that I had learnt over the years,” says Rahane.

3rd Test
The first Test match at Lord's saw Chris Tremlett make his England Test debut. Michael Vaughan won the toss and chose to bat first. Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook took advantage of average Indian bowling scoring 40 runs after only 5 overs putting on 76 before Sourav Ganguly made the break through dismissing Cook on 36 lbw from his fourth ball of the match. No further wickets fell in the morning session although Strauss was dropped on 43 by Dinesh Karthik at the stroke of lunch.
Michael Vaughan and Strauss scored a 142 run second wicket partnership that would prove to be crucial in the match. Strauss was dismissed on 96 edging a slider from Anil Kumble . England in a seemingly strong position of 252/2 lost two quick wickets of Michael Vaughan and Paul Collingwood . Vaughan edged an R. P. Singh delivery straight to Dhoni while Paul Collingwood went for his first Test duck [5] being deceived by a googly from Kumble and was trapped lbw reducing England to 255/4. This wicket meant Anil Kumble overtook Shane Warne 's Test record of 138 lbw wickets. [6] Ryan Sidebottom joined Kevin Pietersen as nightwatchman and survived 5 deliveries before the day ended with England on 268/4.
Day Two
Heavy rain in the morning and poor weather forecasts made any play on the second day a remote possibility but rain stopped at around 13:00 BST allowing play to resume at 13:50 BST. The restart saw the Indian attack dismiss England for 298 with the final 26 runs costing 6 wickets. Chris Tremlett and Monty Panesar both went for ducks while Sidebottom and Matt Prior went on 1.
There was controversial moment in this session when Pietersen began walking when he edged a ball to Dhoni and appeared to be out caught . He turned back however when he saw his team mates at the pavilion waving him to go back when they saw Steve Bucknor telling Simon Taufel he thought the ball had not carried. TV replays showed the ball did not carry and Pietersen was given not out by the third umpire Ian Gould . This decision did not cost India however as Pietersen did not score any runs before being caught.
Dinesh Karthik was dismissed early on lbw and India could have been 16/2 had Prior not drop Wasim Jaffer in the second over. Rahul Dravid could not make a start and was removed cutting an outswinger to Prior. Sachin Tendulkar consolidated India's innings however scoring 80 runs with Jaffer before he was dismissed on 37. India lost one further wicket of Jaffer (which was Tremlett first Test wicket) and closed the day on 145/4.
Day Three
The day began in similar vein to the previous one with India losing their remaining 6 wickets in the space of 15 overs closing their innings on 201. James Anderson got his career best bowling figures of 5/42 in this innings. [7] Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook negotiated the final two overs of the session before lunch was taken.
Play did not resume until 15:25 BST due to rain. At the restart Zaheer Khan left-handed swing troubled the opening batsmen with Strauss and Cook going out in quick succession before play stopped. After the rain interruption Vaughan and Pietersen survived the final 35 minutes of the play to end the day on 77/2 leading the game by 174 runs.
Day Four
England scored 25 runs before Vaughan was clean bowled by R. P. Singh . Collingwood and Bell 's wickets soon followed and England were 132/5. No further wickets fell in the morning session and England went into lunch at 161/5. The afternoon session started with Prior and Pietersen putting on 90 runs at a rate of 5 an over to swing the game in England's favour before Prior was eventually caught by Dhoni. Chris Tremlett completed his pair being bowled by Khan, becoming the first Englishman since 1999 to get a pair on debut. [8] Pietersen struggled to protect the tail and England were dismissed for 282 before tea setting India a target of 380 runs for victory. Singh got his bowling figures of 5/59 in this innings.
In the final session of the day, India scored runs quickly, making 137 runs at a cost of 3 wickets. India lost the key wickets of Dravid and Tendulkar both out lbw. Going into a tense final day, all results were still possible.
Day Five
India lost two early wickets of Sourav Ganguly (lbw) and Karthik (caught) meaning that any chance of an Indian victory disappeared. Weather forecasts had predicted rain and it became a race against time for England to win the match before rain arrived while India would have to hold out for a draw. VVS Laxman and Dhoni produced a stand of 86 runs before Laxman was bowled by Tremlett.
This left Dhoni with the task of rear guard which was to protect the tail from the English attack. The next 3 wickets fell within 8 overs leaving India on 263/9. With light deteriorating Vaughan and Panesar bowled the final 7 overs of the match. Sreesanth survived a strong lbw appeal from Panesar before bad light forced tea to be taken early. Rain meant that there was no evening session and the Test ended in a draw . Pietersen was awarded man of the match for his 134 century.

After the redevelopment
The venue is home to Glamorgan County Cricket Club which has played its home matches there since 24 May 1967, [3] after moving away from Cardiff Arms Park . A 125-year lease of the ground was acquired in 1995, with the previous leaseholders, Cardiff Athletic Club , moving its cricket section ( Cardiff Cricket Club ) to the Diamond Ground in Whitchurch . Beside the cricket ground is the large sports hall complex of the Sport Wales National Centre . Cardiff Corinthians F.C. have previously used the area for football. In July 2007, Glamorgan cricketer Mike Powell was granted his wish to have a rib, removed during surgery, buried at the ground. [4]
International cricket[ edit ]
Sophia Gardens has been an international cricket venue since 20 May 1999, when it played host to the 1999 Cricket World Cup match between Australia and New Zealand . From 2001 to 201ointing one for Pune Warriors India , Robin Uthappa remained their top scorer scoring 405 runs from 16 games, which included a blistering 69 against the RCB. The same happened in Season 6 of IPL, although team's performance was poor, Robin Uthappa managed to score 434 runs in 16 matches.
For the seventh season of IPL , he was drafted in by Kolkata Knight Riders. He failed to perform well in first leg of the tournament conducted in UAE . He was then promoted to the opening position with Gautam Gambhir and performed well in the India-leg of the season. He won the Orange Cap, given for scoring most runs in the season, 660, and in the process created a T20 record for having scored 40+ scores in 8 consecutive games. [7] He eventually made 11, breaking the record held by Mathew Hayden of most 40+ scores in a single season. [8]

Early life and first-class career[ edit ]
Courtney Andrew Walsh was born on 30 October 1962 in Kingston, Jamaica . He played his early cricket there with the same cricket club for which Michael Holding also played cricket—the Melbourne club. Walsh first claim to fame came in 1979 when he took 10 wickets in an innings in school cricket and three years later made his first-class cricket debut. [5] He played 427 matches of this format between 1981 and 2001, and took 1,807 wickets at the average of 21.71, including 104 five-wicket hauls and 20 ten-wicket hauls. [4] Walsh played first-class cricket for Gloucestershire County Cricket Club (Gloucestershire CCC) from 1985 to 1998. [3]
Walsh played cricket for the West Indies from 1984 to 2001, Gloucestershire County Cricket Club (Gloucestershire CCC) from 1984 to 1998, Jamaica cricket team from 1981–82 to 1999–00, Rest of the World XI in 1987 and West Indies A in 1991–92. He first played for Gloucestershire CCC in 1984 and was a mainstay of the side until 1998. [6]
International career[ edit ]
Walsh made his Test debut against Australia in Perth in 1984, taking 2 wickets for 43 runs. [7] He played six Test matches during the 1984–85 season, five against Australia in the 1984–85 series between the teams, and one Test against New Zealand in the home series. [8] He took 16 wickets in the season conceding 507 runs. [9] In the same season, Walsh also made his One Day International debut against Sri Lanka at Hobart during the World Series Cup . He took one wicket for 47 from 10 overs in the match. [9] In the next two seasons, Walsh played a match at home against England, three matches against Pakistan and three matches against New Zealand, both outside the West Indies. [8] He too 29 wickets from seven matches in these seasons, including a five-wicket haul against New Zealand. [9] In 1987, Walsh was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for his performance the previous year. [5]
In the 1987–88 season, Walsh toured India and played four Test matches against them, taking 26 wickets at an average of 16.80. [8] [9] In the first Test of the series at Feroz Shah Kotla Ground , he took six wickets for 67 runs, including five wickets for 54 runs in India's second innings. [10] In the first innings of the second Test at Wankhede Stadium , he repeated the same performance of five for 54. [11] In that season, Pakistan cricket team visited the West Indies and played three Tests there. In the 1987 Cricket World Cup Walsh backed out to ball and run out Saleem Yousuf as he was backing up as Pakistan required two off the last ball to qualify for the semi finals, Abdul Qadir eventually scored the winning runs and West Indies lost but Walsh was deservedly feted for his sportsmanship, he even received a hand-woven carpet from a local fan. Walsh underperformed in the series, taking only four wickets from three matches. He played four matches against England in 1988, and took 12 wickets at an average of 34.33. During the West Indies tour of Australia in 1988–89, Walsh played five Tests and took 17 wickets at 29.41. His best bowling in the series came the first innings of the first match, taking four wickets for 62 runs, including a hat-trick. [9] He took a 'complicated' hat trick at the Brisbane Cricket Ground , dismissing Australia's Tony Dodemaide with the last ball of the first innings and Mike Veletta and Graeme Wood with his first two deliveries in the second. [12] During that winter he also took 10 wickets in a Test match for the first time against India in Kingston.
In 1994, he was appointed captain of the West Indies for the tours of India and New Zealand after Richie Richardson was ordered to rest because of "acute fatigue syndrome". In 1995, he took 62 Test wickets at an average of 21.75 runs per wicket, a performance which he bettered in 2000 when he took 66 Test wickets at an average of 18.69, including 34 wickets in the Test series against England at an average of 12.82 runs per wicket. Coming close to the record for a West Indian bowler of 35 wickets in a Test series (set by Malcolm Marshall in 1988). In the 1990s, his partnership with Curtly Ambrose was one of the most feared bowling attacks in world cricket.
During the first part of his career, Walsh served as the "stock" bowler in an attack featuring Marshall, Joel Garner and later Ambrose, but after the retirement of Marshall and Garner took the role as opening bowler. His action lacked the elegance of those bowlers, but its economy and his natural athleticism ensured he was accurate and durable, even over very long spells and he used his height (about 198 cm, or six-foot-six) to extract occasionally vicious bounce. Even as he lost pace in the later stage of his career he continued to take wickets at an undiminished rate; teams tended to defend against him and Ambrose and attack the weaker third and fourth bowlers.
Walsh played his last ODI against New Zealand in 2000 and his last Test match against South Africa in his homeland, Jamaica, in 2001.
A graph showing Walsh's test career bowling statistics and how they have varied over time.
Walsh is one of only four bowlers to have bowled over 5000 overs in Test cricket, the other three being spinners : Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka and Shane Warne of Australia, and Anil Kumble of India. These four, in addition to Glenn McGrath are also the only bowlers to have taken 500 or more Test wickets. Among the five, Walsh is the only one who has not taken 8 or more wickets in an innings. In ODIs, Walsh was not as successful although he will be remembered for his best performance, 5 wickets for just 1 run against Sri Lanka in 1986. In first-class cricket, he took 5 wickets in an innings more than 100 times and 10 wickets in a match 20 times.
His highest score, coincidentally, was 30 in both forms of the game. By the end of his career, he had such a reputation for poor batting that the crowd would cheer every ball he faced. [2] Whether this was in appreciation of his batting or an attempt to wind up the bowling side is open to interpretation. Walsh is a much loved and respected cricketer and the West Indies have arguably yet to find a fast bowler with anything approaching his talents.
Walsh is also famous for his sportsmanlike gesture of not mankading last man Saleem Jaffar of Pakistan in a World Cup match in 1987, which cost the West Indies the match and a place in the semi-finals.
He is currently a regular feature of the Lashings World XI alongside other cricket legends including Sachin Tendulkar and fellow West Indian Richie Richardson . In May 2004, Walsh was chosen one of the Jamaica's five greatest cricketers of all time. [13]
Courtney Walsh also owns a restaurant in Jamaica called Cuddyz.
Records[ edit ]
Walsh took 5 wickets in an ODI match conceding only one run against Sri Lanka in December 1986, a match which the West Indies won at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium , Sharjah by 193 runs. This was his solitary five-wicket haul in the format. [14] In February 1998, he played his 100th Test, against England in Georgetown, Guyana . In 2000, Walsh became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket, breaking a six-year-old record of Kapil Dev's 434 wickets. He achieve2, the ground was a regular venue for One Day Internationals , hosting nine matches in 12 years, but it was not until 2006 that it hosted its first England match, the first match of the series against Pakistan on 30 August 2006. In 2012, the ground was named as one of three venues for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy , along with The Oval and Edgbaston ; it hosted five matches, including the opener between India and South Africa on 6 June 2013, and the semi-final between India and Sri Lanka on 20 June. [5] The ground also hosted two Twenty20 Internationals between England and Pakistan in September 2010, and it is due to host another against Australia in August 2015. [6]
On 11 April 2008, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that the venue would host a series of major Test matches over the next four years. It would host its first Test match on 8 July 2009 as the opening match of an Ashes series between England and Australia. [7] This made Sophia Gardens the 100th Test match venue . In July 2011, the ECB stripped the ground of its right to host the 2012 West Indies Test because of Glamorgan's late payment of the £2.5 million fee it owed for hosting the 2011 Sri Lanka Test. [8] The ground was originally set to host a Test match against New Zealand in 2013, but this was given up in exchange for the 2013 Champions Trophy. [5] The ground was chosen as the venue for the first Test of the 2015 Ashes series . [9]

The £9.4 million cost to redevelop stadium was funded by with approximately half (£4.5 million) being provided in the form of a Cardiff Council loan. [10] It is possible that the revamped stadium could host seven Test matches, nine One Day Internationals and two World Cup games up to 2028, injecting at least £50 million into the local economy. [11] [12] Construction of the redevelopment of Sophia Gardens began in April 2007, [7] and the redeveloped stadium was first opened for competitive matches on 9 May 2008, when the Glamorgan Dragons played the Gloucestershire Gladiators in a Friends Provident Trophy match in which the Gladiators won by six wickets.

On 4 March 2008, Glamorgan Cricket Club announced a 10-year sponsorship deal with SWALEC , thought to be the biggest single sponsorship by a county cricket club, giving SWALEC the naming rights to the new stadium, worth in excess of £1.5 million over 10 years. [14]
In June 2015, ahead of the First Test of the 2015 Ashes series , the stadium was renamed as simply "The SSE SWALEC" in reflection of the ownership of sponsors SWALEC by SSE plc . [15] The new logo from June 2015 was designed to reflect the shape of the stadium. [16]

Swann's six completes India's humiliation

England 591 for 6 dec (Bell 235, Pietersen 175) beat India 300 (Dravid 146*, Bresnan 3-54) & 283 (Tendulkar 91, Mishra 84, Swann 6-106) by an innings and eight runs

Graeme Swann's six wickets led England's charge to a famous whitewash on a dramatic final day at The Oval as India collapsed during the afternoon session, which included Sachin Tendulkar falling for 91. An increasingly agitated home side had been frustrated as Tendulkar and Amit Mishra added 144 for the fourth wicket, but once Swann made the breakthrough the rest of India's resistance crumbled. The innings folded in 15 overs with England winning by an innings and eight runs.
Swann's success made it the complete series for England, where everyone played a key role in either setting up, positioning or securing a victory. This was a display of attacking offspin of the highest quality, although the wide smile he wore when he savoured his fifth wicket, as Gautam Gambhir sliced to backward point, and his sixth to complete victory, hadn't been so evident during the earlier part of the day. All the frustration, though, vanished in a clatter of wickets.
By batting through the morning without further loss, India had managed their first wicketless session of the series, increasing the prospects of a draw that would have salvaged a modicum of pride. However, that was being overshadowed by the progress of Tendulkar towards the century that would have completed his 100th international hundred - the landmark that has stalked him throughout the series. It continued to prove elusive.
Smart stats
England won by a 4-0 or greater margin for only the seventh time in their Test history.
For India, it's their sixth series defeat by such a margin - their previous one was in Australia in 1991-92.
It's India's 11th innings defeat against England, and the third time they've lost at least two Tests against them in a series by an innings.
England averaged 59.76 runs per wicket, and lost 47 wickets in the series; India averaged 25.55, and lost 80.
Graeme Swann's 6 for 106 is his first five-for against India, and the 11th in his career. He also went past 150 Test wickets, and is fourth among England spinners , after Derek Underwood, Jim Laker and Tony Lock.
Sachin Tendulkar's 91 is his ninth score in the nineties in Tests , pushing him level with Michael Slater. Only Rahul Dravid and Steve Waugh, with ten, have more nineties.
Tim Bresnan, with his first ball of new spell, swung one back into Tendulkar, who was hit on the pad, and Rod Tucker raised his finger. Replays showed it was clipping leg stump. It hadn't been a classic Tendulkar innings by any means, but the fact he'd had at least three lives raised the belief that it was to be his day.
The previous evening, England had failed to appeal for a stumping when Tendulkar momentarily lifted his foot, and two further opportunities were missed on the final day. Alastair Cook dropped a relatively straightforward chance at short leg when Tendulkar had 70, and Matt Prior shelled a thick edge with him on 85. During a wonderful contest with Swann, there was also an lbw appeal from a missed sweep that, had there been the DRS and England had reviewed, would have been overturned. The look on Tendulkar's face when he was finally given suggested he too would have reviewed given the chance, but it wouldn't have mattered.
To highlight that Tendulkar's innings wasn't fluent, it was Mishra who dominated the partnership and caused England, possibly, the greater headache. His second Test fifty had come from 103 balls, and he used his feet against Swann, while playing leg-side shots off the quicks that wouldn't have looked out of place coming off Tendulkar's bat.
For all his failings with the ball, Mishra showed tremendous application with the bat that has been missing from some of his team-mates. For a while it appeared he may even beat his partner to three figures but Swann's persistence paid off when a delivery scooted past the edge. Mishra's presence, and the missed chances off Tendulkar, had certainly got England hot under the collar and Andrew Strauss was given an official warning for his players walking across the pitch.
England's on-field temper can still boil over, but it showed the hunger to win. The final two days of this match were of terrific value to them, even if the foot-sore bowlers might not agree, because Test victories shouldn't come easily. To be made to work, as they were yesterday by Rahul Dravid and today by Tendulkar and Mishra, and to come through with victory, will stand them in good stead.
England know how to sense an opening and continued to surge through line-up. Suresh Raina completed a horror match as he was given lbw to complete a pair, which used up 42 deliveries, although it was a poor decision from Simon Taufel. There was an inside edge before pad and the ball was also heading over the stumps.

XFDF 3.0 specification
XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) is the XML version of Forms Data Format, but the XFDF implements only a subset of FDF containing forms and annotations. There are not XFDF equivalents for some entries in the FDF dictionary - such as the Status, Encoding, JavaScript, Pages keys, EmbeddedFDFs, Differences and Target. In addition, XFDF does not allow the spawning, or addition, of new pages based on the given data; as can be done when using an FDF file. The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in XML Forms Data Format Specification. [65] The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard. As of November 2014, XFDF 3.0 is in the ISO/IEC standardization process under the formal name ISO/CD 19444-1 - Document management - XML forms data format - Part 1: XFDF 3.0. [69]
XFDF can be used the same way as FDF; e.g., form data is submitted to a server, modifications are made, then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form. A support for importing and exporting XFDF stand-alone files is not widely implemented in free or freeware PDF software. Import of XFDF is implemented in Adobe Reader 5 and later versions; import and export is implemented in PDF-XChange Viewer Free; embedding of XFDF data in PDF form is implemented in pdftk (pdf toolkit).
Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA)[ edit ]
Main article: XML Forms Architecture
In the PDF 1.5 format, Adobe Systems introduced a new, proprietary format for forms, namely Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) forms. The XFA 2.02 is referenced in the PDF 1.5 specification (and also in later versions) but is described separately in Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification, which has several versions. [70] XFA specification is not included in ISO 32000-1 PDF 1.7 and is only referenced as an external proprietary specification created by Adobe. XFA was not standardized as an ISO standard. In 2011 the ISO Committee (TC 171/SC 2/WG 8) urged Adobe Systems to submit the XFA Specification for standardization. [8]
Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with AcroForms. Adobe Reader contains "disabled features" for use of XFA Forms, that activate only when opening a PDF document that was created using enabling technology available only from Adobe. [71] [72] The XFA Forms are not compatible with Adobe Reader prior to version 6.
XFA forms can be created and used as PDF files or as XDP ( XML Data Package ) files. The format of an XFA resource in PDF is described by the XML Data Package Specification. [40] The XDP may be a standalone document or it may in turn be carried inside a PDF document. XDP provides a mechanism for packaging form components within a surrounding XML container. An XDP can also package a PDF file, along with XML form and template data. [70] PDF may contain XFA (in XDP format), but also XFA may contain PDF. [70] When the XFA (XML Forms Architecture) grammars used for an XFA form are moved from one application to another, they must be packaged as an XML Data Package. [73]
When the PDF and XFA are combined, the result is a form in which each page of the XFA form overlays a PDF background. This architecture is sometimes referred to as XFAF (XFA Foreground). The alternative is to express all of the form, including boilerplate, directly in XFA (without using PDF, or only using "Shell PDF" which is a container for XFA with minimal skeleton of PDF markup, or using a pre-rendered depiction of a static XFA form as PDF pages). It is sometimes called full XFA. [73]
Starting with PDF 1.5, the text contents of variable text form fields, as well as markup annotations may include formatting information (style information). These rich text strings are XML documents that conform to the rich text conventions specified for the XML Forms Architecture specification 2.02, which is itself a subset of the XHTML 1.0 specification, augmented with a restricted set of CSS2 style attributes. [40] In PDF 1.6, PDF supports the rich text elements and attributes specified in the XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification, 2.2. In PDF 1.7, PDF supports the rich text elements and attributes specified in the XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification, 2.4. [40]
Most PDF processors do not handle XFA content. When generating a shell PDF it is recommended to include in the PDF markup a simple one-page PDF image displaying a warning message (e.g. "To view the full contents of this document, you need a later version of the PDF viewer.", etc.). PDF processors that can render XFA content should either not display the supplied warning page image or replace it quickly with the dynamic form content. [35] Examples of PDF software with some support of XFA rendering include Adobe Reader for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X (but not Adobe Reader Mobile for Android or iOS) or Nuance PDF Reader.
Logical structure and accessibility[ edit ]
This section requires expansion .
(May 2008)
A "tagged" PDF (ISO 32000-1:2008 14.8) includes document structure and semantics information to enable reliable text extraction and accessibility. Technically speaking, tagged PDF is a stylized use of the format that builds on the logical structure framework introduced in PDF 1.3. Tagged PDF defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images) to be extracted and reused for other purposes. [74]
Tagged PDF is not required in situations where a PDF file is intended only for print. Since the feature is optional, and since the rules for Tagged PDF as specified in ISO 32000-1 are relatively vague, support for tagged PDF amongst consuming devices, including assistive technology (AT), is uneven. [75]
An AIIM project to develop an ISO-standardized subset of PDF specifically targeted at accessibility began in 2004, eventually becoming PDF/UA .
Security and signatures[ edit ]
(May 2008)
A PDF file may be encrypted for security, or digitally signed for authentication.
The standard security provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords, user password, which encrypts the file and prevents opening, and owner password, which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted, which can include: printing, copying text and graphics out of the document, modifying the document, or adding or modifying text notes and AcroForm fields. The user password (controls opening) encrypts the file and requires password cracking to defeat, with difficulty depending on password strength and encryption method – it is potentially very secure (assuming good password and encryption method without known attacks). The owner password (controls operations) does not encrypt the file, and instead relies on client software to respect these restrictions, and is not secure. An "owner password" can be removed by many commonly available "PDF cracking" software, including some free online services. [76] Thus, the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed; this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.
Even without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF readers ignore the permission "protections" and allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection.
Some solutions, like Adobe's LiveCycle Rights Management, are more robust means of information rights management, which can not only restrict who can open documents but also reliably enforce permissions in ways that the standard security handler does not.
Usage rights[ edit ]
Beginning with PDF 1.5, Usage rights (UR) signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a bona fide granting authority. For example, it can be used to allow a user: [40]
to save the PDF document along with modified form and/or annotation data
import form data files in FDF, XFDF and text (CSV/TSV) formats
export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats
submit form data
apply a digital signature to existing digital signature form field
create, delete, modify, copy, import, export annotations
For example, Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader, using public-key cryptography . Adobe Reader verifies that the signature uses a certificate from an Adobe- authorized certificate authority. The PDF 1.5 specification declares that other PDF viewer applications are free to use this same mechanism for their own purposes. [40]
This section requires expansion .
(August 2008)
PDF files can have document-level and page-level file attachments, which the reader can access and open or save to their local filesystem. PDF attachments can be added to existing PDF files for example using pdftk . Adobe Reader provides support for attachments, and poppler based readers like Evince or Okular also have some support for document-level attachments.
Metadata[ edit ]
PDF files can contain two types of metadata. [77] The first is the Document Information Dictionary, a set of key/value fields such as author, title, subject, creation and update dates. This is stored in the optional Info trailer of the file. A small set of fields is defined, and can be extended with additional text values if required.
Later, in PDF 1.4, support was added for the Metadata Streams, using the Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) to add XML standards-based extensible metadata as used in other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, as well as the whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema.
Future[ edit ]
ISO 32000-2: Next-generation PDF[ edit ]
Known in PDF syntax terms as "PDF-2.0", ISO 32000-2 will be the first update to the PDF specification developed entirely within the ISO Committee process (TC 171 SC 2 WG 8). Publication of ISO 32000-2 is expected in the first half of 2016. Interested parties resident in TC 171 Member or Observer countries and wishing to participate should contact their country's Member Body or the secretary of TC 171 SC 2. [78] Members of the PDF Association may review and comment on drafts via the PDF Association's Category A liaison with ISO TC 171 SC 2. [79]
See also: Page description markup language
Adobe was exploring an XML-based next-generation PDF code-named Mars. [80]
The format of graphic elements of Mars was sometimes described simply as SVG , [81] but according to the version 0.8 draft specification of November 2007 (§3 Mars SVG Support) the format was actually merely similar to SVG: it contained both additions to and subtractions from SVG, so it was in general neither viewable by nor creatable with standard SVG tools: some things looked noticeably different between SVG viewers and Mars viewers.
Adobe Systems ceased development of Mars in 2008. [82]
Scanned documents[ edit ]
PDF files created by scanning hard-copy documents containing primarily text do not have the same structure as a PDF file of the same document created directly. The scanned document internally contains a picture of the document, with no information about the text. As far as a user can see it is just another PDF file, with a name and extension indistinguishable from any other; a good scan may look exactly the same as a native PDF file, although a visually poor-quality file, often with skewed pages, gives away its nature. However, the file size will be different, and it will not be possible to search for text. For a scan of adequate quality it is possible with suitable software to regenerate the text of the document with Optical character recognition (OCR), and embed it in the file so as to make it searchable, subject to the accuracy of the OCR.
Accessibility[ edit ]
PDF files can be created specifically to be accessible for disabled people. [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] PDF file formats in use as of 2014 [update] can include tags ( XML ), text equivalents, captions, audio descriptions, etc. Tagged PDF is required in the PDF/A -1a specification. [88] [89] Some software can automatically produce tagged PDFs, but this feature is not always enabled by default. [90] [91] Leading screen readers , including JAWS , Window-Eyes , Hal, and Kurzweil 1000 and 3000 can read tagged PDFs aloud, as can later versions of the Acrobat and Acrobat Reader programs. [92] [93] [94] Moreover, tagged PDFs can be re-flowed and magnified for readers with visual impairments. Problems remain with adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents. In these cases, accessibility tags and re-flowing are unavailable, and must be created either manually or with OCR techniques. These processes are inaccessible to some disabled people.
One of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) the tags view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). The tags view is what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver a high-quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities. The content view is based on the physical order of objects within the PDF's content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support the tags view, such as the Reflow feature in Adobe's Reader.
PDF/UA , the International Standard for accessible PDF based on ISO 32000-1 was published as ISO 14289-1 in 2012, and establishes normative language for accessible PDF technology.
Viruses and exploits[ edit ]
See also: Adobe Acrobat Security
PDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in 2001. The virus, named OUTLOOK.PDFWorm or Peachy, uses Microsoft Outlook to send itself as an attachment to an Adobe PDF file. It was activated with Adobe Acrobat, but not with Acrobat Reader. [95]
From time to time, new vulnerabilities are discovered [96] in various versions of Adobe Reader, prompting the company to issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software. Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused. [97] One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.
On March 30, 2010 security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable if the user allows it to launch when asked. [98]
Usage restrictions and monitoring[ edit ]
PDFs may be encrypted so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. The PDF Reference defines both 40-bit and 128-bit encryption, both making use of a complex system of RC4 and MD5 . The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF.
PDF files may also contain embedded DRM restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing. The restrictions on copying, editing, or printing depend on the reader software to obey them, so the security they provide is limited.
The PDF Reference has technical details for an end-user overview. [99] Like HTML files, PDF files may submit information to a web server. This could be used to track the IP address of the client PC, a process known as phoning home . After update 7.0.5 to Acrobat Reader, the user is notified "... via a dialogue box that the author of the file is auditing usage of the file, and be offered the option of continuing." [100]
Through its LiveCycle Policy Server product, Adobe provides a method to set security policies on specific documents. This can include requiring a user to authenticate and limiting the period during which a document can be accessed or amount of time a document can be opened while offline. Once a PDF document is tied to a policy server and a specific policy, that policy can be changed or revoked by the owner. This controls documents that are otherwise "in the wild." Each document open and close event can also be tracked by the policy server. Policy servers can be set up privately or Adobe offers a public service through Adobe Online Services. As with other forms of DRM, adherence to these policies and restrictions may or may not be enforced by the reader software being used.
Default display settings[ edit ]
PDF documents can contain display settings, including the page display layout and zoom level. Adobe Reader uses these settings to override the user's default settings when opening the document. [101] The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings.
Content[ edit ]
A PDF file is often a combination of vector graphics , text, and bitmap graphics . The basic types of content in a PDF are:
Text stored as content streams (i.e., not text)
Vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines
Raster graphics for photographs and other types of image
Multimedia objects in the document
In later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), forms, JavaScript (initially available as plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins.
PDF 1.6 supports interactive 3D documents embedded in the PDF - 3D drawings can be embedded using U3D or PRC and various other data formats. [102] [103]
Two PDF files that look similar on a computer screen may be of very different sizes. For example, a high resolution raster image takes more space than a low resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.
For more details on this topic, see List of PDF software .
PDF viewers are generally provided free of charge, and many versions are available from a variety of sources.
There are many software options for creating PDFs, including the PDF printing capabilities built into Mac OS X and most Linux distributions, LibreOffice , Microsoft Office 2007 (if updated to SP2 ), [104] WordPerfect 9, Scribus , numerous PDF print drivers for Microsoft Windows , the pdfTeX typesetting system, the DocBook PDF tools, applications developed around Ghostscript and Adobe Acrobat itself as well as Adobe InDesign , Adobe FrameMaker , Adobe Illustrator , Adobe Photoshop . Google 's online office suite Google Docs also allows for uploading, and saving to PDF.
Raster image processors (RIPs) are used to convert PDF files into a raster format suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and prepress in a process known as rasterisation . RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine [105] from Adobe Systems and Jaws [106] and the Harlequin RIP from Global Graphics .
This section requires expansion .
(July 2010)
There is specialized software for editing PDF files, though the choices are much more limited and often more expensive than creating and editing standard editable document formats. Version 0.46 and later of Inkscape allows PDF editing through an intermediate translation step involving Poppler .
Serif PagePlus can open, edit and save existing PDF documents, as well as publishing of documents created in the package.
Enfocus PitStop Pro, a plugin for Acrobat, allows manual and automatic editing of PDF files, [107] while the free Enfocus Browser makes it possible to edit the low-level structure of a PDF. [108]

Adobe Acrobat is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as free software (under the GNU General Public License ) is PDFedit . Another GPL-licensed application native to the unix environment is Xournal . Xournal allows for annotating in different fonts and colours, as well as a rule for quickly underlining and highlighting lines of text or paragraphs. Xournal also has a shape recognition tool for squares, rectangles and circles. In Xournal annotations may be moved, copied and pasted. The freeware Foxit Reader , available for Microsoft Windows , OS X and Linux , allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's PDF-XChange Viewer allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. Apple 's Mac OS X 's integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the freeware Skim , with the latter supporting interaction with LaTeX , SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with BibDesk reference management software. Freeware Qiqqa can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs.
For mobile annotation, iAnnotate PDF (from Branchfire) and GoodReader (from Aji) allow annotation of PDFs as well as exporting summaries of the annotations.
There are also web annotation systems that support annotation in pdf and other documents formats, e.g., A.nnotate , crocodoc , WebNotes .
In cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents, ink annotation is required. Some programs that accept ink input from the mouse may not be responsive enough for handwriting input on a tablet. Existing solutions on the PC include PDF Annotator and Qiqqa .

Examples of PDF software as online services including Scribd for viewing and storing, Pdfvue for online editing, and Zamzar for PDF Conversion.
In 1993 the Jaws raster image processor from Global Graphics became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997. [109]
Agfa-Gevaert introduced and shipped Apogee, the first prepress workflow system based on PDF, in 1997.
Many commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press-ready PDF files as a print source, specifically the PDF/X-1a subset and variations of the same. [110] The submission of press-ready PDF files are a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files.
PDF was selected as the "native" metafile format for Mac OS X, replacing the PICT format of the earlier Mac OS . The imaging model of the Quartz graphics layer is based on the model common to Display PostScript and PDF, leading to the nickname Display PDF. The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the Safari web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the OS-standard printing architecture. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header. When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions 10.0 through 10.3, the image was also captured as a PDF; later versions save screen captures as a PNG file, though this behaviour can be set back to PDF if desired.
Some desktop printers also support direct PDF printing, which can interpret PDF data without external help. Currently, all PDF capable prscored 104 not out, his first century in international cricket in over a year. [265] After being knocked out of the tournament, Ponting resigned his position as captain at both Test and ODI levels, endorsed Michael Clarke as his successor, and indicated his intention to continue playing. [266]
2011–2012: Post-captaincy[ edit ]
In 2011, Ponting was inducted into Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) 'Best of the Best'. [267] He was selected in Michael Clarke 's teams for the tours of Sri Lanka and South Africa in 2011, scoring an important half-century (62) in the fourth innings of the second Test against South Africa in Johannesburg , helping Australia chase down a target of 310 to draw the series 1–1. [268]
In the 2011–12 Australian summer, a disappointing series draw with New Zealand gave rise to calls for Ponting to be removed from the team following perceived underperformances. The selectors resisted the calls, selecting Ponting for the Boxing Day Test —the first of a four-Test series against India. [269] Ponting scored two half-centuries in Australia's first Test win, [270] followed by a century (134) in Australia's first innings of the second Test in Sydney. The century was his first in Test cricket in almost two years. [271] His fourth-wicket partnership of 288 runs with Clarke, who went on to make 329 not out, set a new record for the biggest partnership by an Australian pair of batsmen against India. [272] Australia sealed the series win by defeating India in Perth, and in the fourth Test in Adelaide, Ponting and Clarke beat their own record, putting on 386 runs. The partnership was the fourth highest to that point in Australian Test cricket. Ponting's own score was 221. [273] During the innings, he became only the third player and the first Australian (after Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid , who were playing in the same match) to pass 13,000 career Test runs. [274]
2012: Test retirement[ edit ]
On Australia Day 2012 he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia for services to cricket and, through the Ponting Foundation, the community. [275] Ponting was promoted to captain in the 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia in Michael Clarke's absence due to injury. However, after only two games as captain he was dropped, having scored only 18 runs in 5 games of the 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series . At a press conference thereafter, Ponting conceded, "I don't expect to play one-day international cricket for Australia any more and I'm pretty sure the selectors don't expect to pick me either ... I will continue playing Test cricket and I'll continue playing for Tasmania as well". [276]
On 29 November 2012 Ponting announced that he would retire from Test cricket after the WACA test against South Africa. [277]
2013: Tasmania and Surrey[ edit ]
After retiring from test cricket, Ponting played out the Sheffield Shield season with eventual champions Tasmania . He was the competition's leading run scorer with 911 runs at an average of 75.91. [278] As a result of his prolific form with the bat, he was named the Sheffield Shield player of the year. [279]
He signed on to play for the English County side Surrey during June–July 2013. [280] His score of 192 on debut against Derbyshire was the highest score by a Surrey batsman on their first class debut for the county. Ponting scored an unbeaten 169 against Nottinghamshire in his final first class innings, ensuring his team held on for a draw. [281]
During the Ashes 2013 , Ponting wrote a regular column for the Daily Mail . [282]
At the formal opening of the Bellerive Oval redevelopment in January 2015, it was announced that the new Western Stand would be named the Ricky Ponting Stand in his honour. [283]



Domestic career[ edit ]
On 2 March 2008, before facing England for the test series, McCullum was involved in the State Shield Final versus the Auckland Aces , scoring 170 runs for the Otago Volts to help beat the Aces at Eden Park 's outer oval, and helped to chase down a daunting total of 7 for 310, he broke multiple State Shield batting records.
State Shield (One Day) (off 52 balls), including 14 fours and 5 sixes.
When he got to 135, he scored the highest individual runs for an Otago Volts player.
When he got to 162, he scored the highest score by any player in a domestic one-day match (Shell or State competitions) overtaking Blair Hartland 's previous record.
He went on to score 170 runs, including 19 fours and 7 sixes.
McCullum played for Glamorgan in 2006 and he scored 160 opening the batting against Leicestershire in the County Championship.
On 24 January 2009, he lined up for New South Wales in the final of Australia's KFC Twenty20 Big Bash. This was an exercise to allow him to be eligible to play for them in the Twenty20 Champions League. This sparked criticism however despite opinion States are permitted to have one overseas player in their squad. McCullum also donated his match fee from the game to Otago Junior Cricket.
On 16 January 2010 during the 2009-10 HRV Cup , vs Auckland Aces at University Oval , McCullum hit 108 not out off 67 deliveries, which included 10 fours and four sixes to lead Otago Volts to victory with three balls to spare. McCullum reached his 50 off 32 deliveries and his century off 65 deliveries.

In 2003 he played in a Test series against England and scored what was then his highest score, an innings of 96 at Lord's . His maiden Test century came several months later when he scored 143 against Bangladesh . He fell just short of his second Test hundred in a game against Sri Lanka when dismissed one short of his hundred. His second century would later come with a run a ball 111 against Zimbabwe .
He was selected in the 20-man ICC World XI squad for the ICC Super Series in July 2005.
On 20 February 2007, he scored 86 not out as New Zealand went on to be the first team to whitewash Australia in a three-match ODI series since 1997. During the innings he partnered with Craig McMillan to score 165, equalling the world record for a 6th wicket partnership. [8]
On 31 December 2007 he scored 50 from just 19 balls against Bangladesh. He finished his innings with 80 runs from only 28 balls, including 9 fours and 6 sixes with a strike rate of 285.71.
On 18 April 2008, he achieved the highest Twenty20 individual score in an innings. [9] This eclipsed the previous record mark of 141, held by Australian Cameron White . Coincidentally, McCullum faced an over from White during the match and scored 24 from it; it was White's only over in that match. [10] This record was eventually broken by Chris Gayle when he piled on 175 runs in IPL 2013. In the same match he also claimed the record for most sixes (13) in a Twenty20 innings, [11] which was later surpassed by Englishman Graham Napier (16).
He was bought by Kochi Tuskers Kerala in the 2011 IPL auctions. He returned to the Knight Riders in 2012. In the 2014 IPL auctions, McCullum was bought by Chennai Super Kings . He was given the role of opening the innings along with West Indian Dwayne Smith and the pair was considered as the most dangerous opening pair in the league's history.
Captaincy to present[ edit ]

On 5 April 2009, on day three of the third Test match during India's tour of New Zealand , he displayed an amazing level of alertness in the dismissal of Rahul Dravid . Dravid attempted a sweep shot off Daniel Vettori 's bowling, but McCullum saw what Dravid was up to before the ball had even pitched and moved swiftly to his left (Dravid's leg side). Ross Taylor at first slip did the same. The ball came nicely off Dravid's bat, but flew straight into the hands of a waiting Brendon McCullum. [12] A couple of balls earlier, McCullum tried the same thing, but he had been a little slow and Dravid's sweep was kept low. Although there has been some discussion regarding the legality of McCullum's movement before the ball had even pitched, the laws of cricket indicate he was well within his right to do so. [13]
On 6 November 2009, vs Pakistan at Abu Dhabi, McCullum scored his second ODI century (131, 129 balls, 14 fours, 3 sixes) to elevate New Zealand to 303 and win the match to level the series. [14]
On 16 February 2010, during the only Test match against Bangladesh , he scored 185, the highest score ever by a New Zealand wicket-keeper in Test cricket. He was also involved in the record highest sixth-wicket partnership for New Zealand of 339 runs with Martin Guptill , missing out on the world record by just 12 runs.
On 27 February 2010, becomes just the second player to score a T20I hundred , finishing 116 not out, one run short of Chris Gayle 's record of 117.
On 4 May 2010 McCullum became the first player to score 1000 T20 international runs. He achieved this feat playing against Zimbabwe in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 at Guyana On 28 June 2010, Brendon McCullum said he will not keep wicket for New Zealand in Test matches. He, however informed that he will still keep in 50-overs & T20 over games. [15] This meant that McCullum would have to cement his place in the test team as a batsman. He did a fine job in his first innings since handing over the Wicket-keeping duties he scored 65 runs and was engaged in a 104 run partnership with Ross Taylor he was promoted to the position of opener in tests rather than his usual number 5 position. McCullum did however have experience of opening the innings because he opens for New Zealand in limited-overs cricket. [16]
On 21 September 2012 at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka, McCullum scored 123 runs against Bangladesh at Pallekele , setting a new record for the highest Twenty20 International innings, and becoming the first player to score two Twenty20 International centuries . This record was broken by Aaron Finch on the 29th of August against England, when he scored 156. However McCullum still remains the only player to have scored two Twenty20 International centuries. [4]
Between 16 and 18 February 2014 at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, McCullum scored 302 runs in the third innings of the second test against India, becoming the first New Zealand batsman to score a triple-century . He shared a 352 run partnership with BJ Watling , a record sixth wicket stand , [17] rescuing New Zealand from a likely innings defeat. McCullum closed the innings at 680/8d, both the highest ever innings by New Zealand, and the highest ever third innings in Test cricket history. [17] [18]
On 21 November 2014, McCullum recorded his first ever wicket at test level, a caught-and-bowled of Pakistan's Sarfraz Ahmed during their second test.
On 29 November 2014, McCullum scored a century on day 2 of the third test against the same opposition, in which both teams decided to call off play on the day before as a tribute to Phillip Hughes , and hand-written P.H. under each player's squad number as a further mark of respect. He was bowled out on 202 after hitting ten sixes in his innings, by far a record for New Zealand opening batsman. [19] Two years after his debut as NZ captain, in which the team was bowled out for a paltry 45, Black Caps returned to respectability.
On 13 December 2014, McCullum was named New Zealander of the Year by the New Zealand Herald beating out stiff competition from Lane Pilkington due to his continued co-operation with ICC over the match-fixing scandal which resulted in Chris Cairns being charged for lying to court, and also for changing the perception of the Black Caps as easy-beats. [20] [21]
On the first day of the Boxing Day Test at Hagley Oval , McCullum scored 195 in the first innings against Sri Lanka, which gave him 1000 test runs in a calendar year, becoming the first New Zealander to reach this milestone (1164 at the end of the match, with Kane Williamson at 929), [22] and the fastest test century (in 74 balls), beating his own record against Pakistan in Sharjah. [23] He fell 5 runs shy of his 4th 200+ scores in a calendar year. His 33 sixes in test cricket in a single calendar year is also a world record. [23] It is also worth noting that New Zealand only played 9 test matches in 2014. [23] He also helped to push New Zealand to score 429/7 on day one, the most runs New Zealand had ever scored in a single day of play in test cricket. [23] It ended with an 8-wicket win, which made it 5 test wins out of 9 in 2014, the most wins in a calendar year. He also closed the year with a triple century and two double centuries, the third person to do so after Donald Bradman and Michael Clarke .
On 3 January 2015, McCullum returned to Basin Reserve, where he scored his triple century against India. While he got a 2-ball duck on a green pitch and three errors as a fielder, he was given a key to Wellington, a symbolic equivalent of "Honourary Citizen", joining Wellington-born Sir Peter Jackson and Sir Richard Taylor for their works on Lord of The Rings as the third person to receive such a gift for last year's heroics. [24] However, the ground witnessed a double century that test by Kumar Sangakkara , a fellow former test wicketkeeper-batsman.
On 20 February 2015, in New Zealand's 3rd Pool A match of the 2015 Cricket World Cup , McCullum scored 77 runs of 25 balls recording the fastest 50 in world cup history (51 runs off 18 balls), and the 4th fastest 50 in ODI history. He also delivered brutal innings against Australia, and South Africa in the semi-final as well. McCullum became the first New Zealand captain to lead his team to the World Cup finals, by putting the six semi-final losses in the past.
McCullum played in the 2015 Cricket World Cup Final , and was bowled for a duck in just the first over of the match by Mitchell Starc , as New Zealand went on to lose to Australia by 7 wickets.
On 21 May 2015, McCullum started in his 93rd consecutive test, and batting in his preferred spot at no. 5.
Role[ edit ]
McCullum originally played in the side as a wicketkeeper -batsman. His glovework improved during his tenure as the New Zealand wicketkeeper. His batting is good enough to earn him selection for the Black Caps alone, shown by the occasions on which he has been unable to keep but has still been selected as a batsman. [25] He opens the batting for New Zealand in ODIs with steadily improving success. He is an aggressive batsman who is particularly strong over extra cover, often lofting the ball into the stands, and also square-cutting, or square-driving the ball. He is also adept at using the scoop shot, even using it at tests, so much so that McScoop was named after him. In 2010 McCullum hung up the gloves In Test cricket due to continued body strain and became a specialist batsmen in Test cricket, opening the innings in his first match as a specialist batsmen against India in Ahmedabad. He was described as a player "especially suited to Twenty20 cricket" when he signed for a five-week stint at Glamorgan in June 2006. [26] The stint included the entire domestic 2006 Twenty20 Cup. He was signed up by the Kolkata Knight Riders of the IPL for $700,000. His contract with the IPL is for three years.
He has the ability to play the Dilscoop , which involves the batsman squatting down and scooping deliveries back over the wicketkeeper's head. Playing this shot in a Twenty20 International match on 28 February 2010 in Lancaster Park , Christchurch, against Australia, he managed to hit Shaun Tait for two sixes in an over back over Brad Haddin 's head. He can also execute reverse sweep well.
During the Twenty20 World Championship in 2009, the wicketkeeping duties was given to Peter McGlashan . He was seen practicing his medium bowling.
McCullum had to decide whether to play for New South Wales, KKR, or Otago in the 1st edition of the Champions League. Since KKR did not qualify, he had only to consider playing for either New South Wales or Otago; eventually he had decided to play for Otago alongside brother Nathan McCullum . [27]
In 2012, BJ Watling became McCullum's replacement as wicketkeeper in Tests, but due to Luke Ronchi 's struggles in ODI's, McCullum still remained as wicketkeeper in ODIs and T20s. But by late 2013, McCullum's recurring back problems meant he can no longer perform wicketkeeping duties effectively, he gave up his gloves to Ronchi in ODIs and T20s, and McCullum became a middle order batsman, or as a cover for opening the batting in tests, having batted at 1,2,5–7 in his career, while his fielding position becomes predominantly mid-off, mid-on or mid-wicket. [28] He is also a very seldomly-used part-time medium pace bowler in tests. He got his first wicket in all forms of international cricket from a caught-and-bowled against Sarfraz Ahmed of Pakistan which ended their first innings in 2014. McCullum was picked for 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup as an opening batsman due to inconsistencies from Martin Guptill and Tom Latham and the emergence of Grant Elliott as a solid option at no. 5 batsman. His role as a pinch hitter saw the team reach their first ever World Cup final. After the World Cup, he returned to his preferred spot at number 5 for test cricket.



Test career[ edit ]
Anwar carried his bat at Eden Gardens scoring 188 not out, his career best in Test cricket
Anwar was an outstanding opener in Test cricket. [16] He played 55 Test matches for Pakistan and scored 4052 at the average of 45.52. He is the seventh-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket, and scored 11 centuries and 25 half-centuries during his international career. [1] As an aggressive opening batsman, most of his centuries turned into relatively big scores. [17] [18] He scored many of his centuries away against almost every team he toured, and averaged more than 40 against three of the four nations – South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and England – which have been most difficult for Asian batsmen. He has the highest Test batting average (59.06) of any Pakistani against Australia, and once scored two consecutive centuries against them. [19] Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja commented the "[Anwar] used an eclectic approach to batting – classical betrothed to unorthodox, footwork against spin as quick as a hiccup supple yet powerful to brush the field like a Picasso." [20]
He made his Test debut against the West Indies in a match which Pakistan lost at Iqbal Stadium , Faisalabad , in 1990. He got a pair in the match. Curtly Ambrose and Ian Bishop dismissed him in the first and second innings respectively. [21] [22] In the third Test of his career, Anwar scored 169 runs in Pakistan's solitary innings against New Zealand in February 1994; Pakistan won the match by an innings and 12 runs. [23] Later in the same year during Pakistan's tour to Sri Lanka, his 94 and 136 runs in the first match at Colombo earned him a man of the match award, and ensured Pakistan's victory by 301 runs. [24] Scroring fifties—85 and 77 runs—in both the innings of the first Test against Australia at Karachi in September 1994, Anwar helped Pakistan led the three match series 1–0 . [25] In the same season against Zimbabwe , he was unsuccessful with bat in the away series; he only managed 45 runs playing in four innings of two Tests. [26] Anwar scored three consecutive fifties against Sri Lanka in the 1995 home series . [27] In the series, he played three innings scoring 154 runs with an average of 51.50. [28]
In the 1996 Pakistan's tour of England , a three-Test match series was played between the teams. [29] Pakistan won the series by 2–0, their fifth consecutive series win against England. [30] Anwar remained the second highest run scorer with 362 runs – only behind Alec Stewart 's 396 – with an average of 60.33. [31] He scored 88 and 74 runs in the first Test at Lord's , and 176 and one runs in the third match at The Oval . [29] [32] In the 1996–97 season , he played two Tests against the touring Zimbabwe and aggregated 182 runs in three innings, the second highest after Wasim Akram 's 292. [33] In the same season, Anwar replaced injured Akram as captain for the home series against New Zealand . [34] He was the second highest run-scorer once again, accumulating 157 runs in three innings, including 149 in the second Test at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium . [35] [36] In the next home series, against South Africa in 1997–98, he only scored 40 runs in four innings at the average of 8.00. [37] He aggregated 236 runs in the away series against the same team—only behind Azhar Mahmood 's 327. [38] He scored 118 runs in the second Test at Kingsmead Cricket Ground , which allowed Pakistan to win a Test match for the first time in South Africa. [39] Anwar scored 150 runs at the average of 37.50, during Pakistan's tour to Zimbabwe . [40]

4 Bowling a yorker
Origin of the term[ edit ]
The term is thought to derive from the 18th and 19th century slang term "to pull Yorkshire" on a person meaning to trick or deceive them, although there is evidence to suggest that the Middle English word "Yuerke" (meaning to trick or deceive) may have been the source.
Play[ edit ]
A batsman who has been "beaten" by a yorker is said to have been "yorked". "Beaten" in this context does not mean that the batsman is bowled or given out LBW but can include the batsmen missing the ball with the bat. A delivery which is intended to be a "yorker" but which does not "york" the batsman is known as an "attempted yorker".
A batsman in his normal stance will raise his bat (backlift) as the bowler bowls which can make the yorker difficult to play when it arrives at the batsman's feet. A batsman may only realise very late that the delivery is of yorker length and will jam their bat down to "dig out" the yorker.
Though the length of the delivery is the defining feature of the yorker, the batsman's difficulty in playing the yorker reflects his misreading the length rather than difficulty in playing that length. The sharp downward deflection, due to gravitational pull, in the tail end of the yorker's trajectory causes difficulty in judging the length, whereas a flat delivery that lands near a batsman's feet can be judged and played without much difficulty. The bowler has to pay attention to both length and trajectory to deliver a perfect yorker.
Use of the yorker[ edit ]
Yorkers are very difficult to play. Here a batsman defends against one in the nets .
A "yorker" is a difficult delivery to bowl as a mistimed delivery can either result in a full toss or half-volley which can easily be played by the batsman. Bowling yorkers is a tactic used most often by fast bowlers . A fast yorker is one of the most difficult types of delivery in cricket to play successfully, as the bat must be swung down right to the pitch to intercept the ball—if any gap remains between the bat and the pitch, the ball can squeeze through and potentially go on to hit the wicket , sending the batsman to the pavilion. The yorker might miss the bat but hit the pads in front of the wicket, resulting in the batsman getting out LBW . When the batsman blocks such a ball, it is referred to as "dug out". A bowler who achieves swing when bowling yorkers can be even more dangerous, as the ball will deviate sideways as it travels towards the batsman, making it even harder to hit.
Yorkers can also be aimed directly at the batsman's feet, forcing the batsman to shift his feet while attempting to play the ball, or risk being hit. Inswinging yorkers have a reputation for being particularly hard to defend and difficult to score runs off. Such a delivery is colloquially known as a sandshoe crusher, toe crusher, cobbler's delight or nail breaker.
Despite the effectiveness of yorkers, they are notoriously difficult to bowl correctly and will usually be attempted only a handful of times during a sequence of several overs . Yorkers are best used to surprise a batsman who has become accustomed to hitting shorter-pitched balls and not with the bat speed necessary to defend against a yorker. As such, a yorker is frequently bowled quickly to give the batsman less time to react and position his bat.
The yorker is regarded as particularly effective against weak "tail-end" batsmen, who often lack the skill to defend even a non-swinging yorker and who are sometimes less susceptible to other bowling tactics. It is also particularly effective in the later stages of an innings in one-day cricket, because it is the most difficult of all deliveries to score off even if defended successfully. Runs will often only be scored off edges or straight down the ground.

Bowling a yorker[ edit ]

[69] He scored two successive hundreds on three other occasions in his career, and was the first batsman to complete this feat in ODIs—in 1996, in 1999, and in 2000. [70] In six matches of the 1994–95 Wills Trophy, he scored 202 runs at the average of 40.40, including a century.

[74] This was the highest individual score by any batsman in the world till Sachin Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 200 against South Africa on 24 February 2010. [75] [3] He accumulated 315 runs from the five matches of the 1998 Silver Jubilee Independence Cup , including 140 runs in the third final against India at Dhaka; India won the match by three wickets.

[86] Anwar dedicated the century to his daughter, who died in 2001. [87]
Wisden Cricketer of the Year – 1997[ edit ]
An opening batsman capable of annihilating any bowling attack on his day, Anwar was an attacking batsman in ODI matches and once settled in Test matches , scored quickly and all over the field. His success came from good timing. Anwar became famous for his trademark flick. He was able to lift a ball that had pitched outside off stump for six over midwicket. Anwar's timing and ability to score quick runs made him a crowd favourite. In 1997, when he was as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year , the cricket almanack Wisden described him that he "moved his front foot and head well across, then his wrists hovered, hawk-like, over the advancing ball, extending further and further as if they were elastic if the ball was slanted ever more away from him, before the bat flowed into a square-drive to the boundary". [5]
Captaincy[ edit ]
Anwar captained Pakistan in seven Tests and 11 ODIs, but his performance as captain was average. [8]
Records and achievements[ edit ]

[48] it was also the highest Test score by a Pakistani on Indian soil which was surpassed by Younis Khan in 2005. [48] [49] [50]
Anwar (194) and Charles Coventry (194*) shared the record for highest individual score in an ODI match until it was overtaken by India's Sachin Tendulkar (200*) against South Africa on 24 February 2010. [75] [3] [89] [90]
Anwar scored two or more successive hundreds on four occasions, and made 20 hundreds in One Day Internationals as a Pakistani opening batsman. [91]
He holds the highest Test batting average (59.06) of any Pakistani against Australia in Test matches. [19]
Retirement[ edit ]
He announced his retirement from International cricket on 15 August 2003, after he was dropped from the squad for the upcoming One-Day International tournament in Sharjah. [6]



Early years[ edit ]
Ceylon, as the country was known before 1972, played its first first-class match under that name against Marylebone Cricket Club at Nomads Ground, Victoria Park, Colombo in 1926–27, losing by an innings . [4] The team's first win came against Patiala at Dhruve Pandove Stadium in 1932–33. [5]
The Ceylonese side competed against Madras in the M. J. Gopalan Trophy games from the 1950s, through the change of name to Sri Lanka, well into the 1970s. Sri Lankan cricket team's One Day International debut came in the 1975 Cricket World Cup and their first One Day International win against a Test cricket playing nation came in the 1979 Cricket World Cup against India . Sri Lanka were later awarded Test cricket status in 1981, by the International Cricket Council .
Rise to Prominence[ edit ]
1996 Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
1996 Cricket World Cup , hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan team was led by Arjuna Ranatunga , where they played their first round in Group A with Australia, West Indies, India, Zimbabwe and Kenya. Australia and The West Indies forfeited the matches against Sri Lanka held in Sri Lankan soil due to safety concerns, so Sri Lanka won both matches by a walkover. Sri Lanka won against Zimbabwe by 6 wickets, courtesy of Aravinda de Silva 's 91 runs. Sanath Jayasuriya overtook Indian bowlers in the next match, where Sri Lanka won the match by 6 wickets. The last group match was against Kenya, Sri Lanka recorded the highest team total in that time by scoring 398/5, Aravinda again played a gem of an inning with 145 runs. This score was the highest score by a Sri Lankan player in the World Cup.
In the first quarter finals, Sri Lanka played with England, where Sanath devastated the English players with his fast 82 runs just off 44 balls. Sri Lanka won the match by 5 wickets and progressed through to their first semi finals in the World Cup. Sri Lanka met India again in the semi-final, and the match was played in Kolkata, at the Eden Gardens, under the eyes of a lot of Indian fans. Sri Lanka came into bat first, but their first three wickets were taken very early. But then, Aravinda and Roshan Mahanama paced the innings with their half-centuries. Skipper Arjuna and Hashan Tillakaratne also played valuable innings. Indian pacer Javagal Srinath took 3 wickets.
Sri Lanka finished with 251/8 in 50 overs, giving Indians a good chance of winning the match. But the Sri Lankan bowling was so good, Navjot Singh Sidhu and skipper Mohammad Azharuddin got out very early. Sachin Tendulkar along with Sanjay Manjrekar slowly built the innings, but their wickets gave Sri Lanka a big chance of winning. When India was 120/8, the Indian fans got aggressive, throwing bottles and other materials into the ground, where the match could not be continued further. The umpires went onto a discussion with both teams and decided to award the match to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka went on to their first finals in World Cup history.
The finals was against Australia led by Mark Taylor at Gaddafi Stadium , Lahore . Before the match, former 1992 Cricket World Cup winning captain Imran Khan talked with Sri Lankan captain Ranatunga, stating that if they won the toss, to choose batting first. This was because the ground was more favorable to batting first and bowling under lights. In the toss however, Ranatunga won the match, but chose to field first. After a blazing start from captain Mark Taylor and young superstar and future captain Ricky Ponting , Australia fell from being 1–137 to 5–170 after which Sri Lanka's four prong spin attack took its toll. After Australia crashed to a 7–241 in its quota of 50 overs, Sri Lanka overcame a nervous start where they lost both openers before the score was 30, to win in 45 overs. Sri Lankan batting sensation Aravinda played a match-winning knock of 107, not out, and was assisted ably by fellow veterans Asanka Gurusinha (65) and captain Ranatunga (47*). De Silva was named man of the match after he had taken 3–42 in his 10 overs eairlier in the Australian innings & Sanath Jayasuriya got man of the series award.
Sri Lankan cricket's greatest moment undoubtedly came during the aforementioned 1996 World Cup , when they defeated the top-ranked Australian team under the leadership of Arjuna Ranatunga in the finals. Sri Lanka's game style over the course of the series revolutionised One Day International Cricket, and was characterised by the highly aggressive batting of their openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana in the first fifteen overs of the innings to take advantage of the fielding restrictions imposed during this period. This strategy has since become a hallmark of One Day International cricket.
1999 Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
1999 Cricket World Cup hosted by England and Netherlands, where Sri Lanka came as defending champions. Ranatunga against lead the team with 1996 World Cup winning members - Jayasuriya, Muralitharan , Mahanama, Hashan, Kalu, Vaas , Aravinda, Pramodya and Upul Chandana . They grouped in Group A with South Africa, India, Zimbabwe, England and Kenya.
Sri Lanka played their first group match with England, where they only scored 204 bowled out in 48.2 overs. the high bouncing pitches gave the subcontinent players a real headache. England won the match comfortably by 8 wickets. In the second group match, against South Africa, they played badly. By chasing 199 runs of South Africa, Sri Lanka only scored 110 runs, only Mahanama scored 36 runs. Against Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka finally won the match by 4 wickets. Zimbabwe only scored 197/9 and Sri Lanka scored 198/6. Next match was with India, where they posted 373/6 in total with Sourav Ganguly played a magnificent 183 runs in 158 balls. Sri Lanka played only 216/10, and India won by 157 runs. With this loss, Sri Lanka eliminated from the World Cup. Being the champions in last World Cup, this world cup campaign was really disappointed. Their last match was against Kenyans, where Sri Lanka won the match by 45 runs.
2003 Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
2003 Cricket World Cup was moved to the African continent, where South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the tournament. Sanath Jayasuriya lead the team. The team was grouped in Pool B with South Africa, New Zealand, West Indies, Bangladesh, Canada and Kenya. The first match was against New Zealand, where Blackcaps captain Stephen Fleming won the toss and sent Sri Lanka in to bat first. Sri Lanka’s opening batsmen- Jayasuriya and Marvan Atapattu were going strong and kept a steady run rate until the fifth over when they conceded their first wicket. Skipper Jayasuriya dominated the Blackcaps bowling attack by scoring 120 runs. The final score at the end of the innings was 272/7. The second innings didn’t start very well for New Zealand, losing their opening batsman, Nathan Astle , in the first over and captain Flemming in the second. The first real form of excitement came for New Zealand supporters when Styris and Cairns start hitting a few boundaries. Scott Styris overpassed Jayasuriya's batting by his 141 runs, but New Zealand all out for 217 in the total. Sri Lanka won by 47 runs and Jayasuriya was named man of the match.
Next match was against Bangladesh, where Chaminda Vaas became the only bowler to claim a hat tricks in the first three balls of any form of international cricket when he took the first three wickets off the opening three balls of the match. With this feat, Vaas became the third of only four players to have achieved two hat tricks. Bangladesh poorly scored 124/10. Sri Lankan opening batsmen reached the target without a wicket falling. At the very next match against Canada, Sri Lanka again involved for a World record, where Canada total of 36 was the lowest total in World Cup history and second lowest in all ODIs. Sri Lanka comfortably won the match by 9 wickets.
All these World Record matches next became a desperate sad for all the Sri Lankans. They lost the match to underdog Kenyans for the first time. The match was at Kenyan soil , Kenya batted first and scored Kennedy Otieno scored 60 runs. Murali took 4 wickets and Vaas with 3 wickets. Sri Lanka came to bat, only Aravinda scored 41 runs. All the others scored less than 30. Sri Lanka all out for just 157 runs in 45 overs. This was the first time that, Sri Lanka lost a match to affiliate nation. Against West Indies, Sri Lanka back in the game, where they chased 222 runs and won the match by 4 wickets. Last group match was against South Africa, Sri Lanka batted first and scored 268/9. South Africa was at 229/6 when rain came. According to Duckworth–Lewis method , match was tied. Finally Sri Lanka reached top of the Pool B, and selected for the quarter finals.
In the quarter finals, they lost to Australia and India, only won over Zimbabwe. This result gave them fourth place in standings, where Kenya recorded first semi-final occasion in the history. Sri Lanka's semi-final was against Australia. On a difficult, slow pitch at Port Elizabeth, Australia struggled their way to 212 (7 wickets, 50 overs) against tight Sri Lankan bowling, thanks mainly to a great innings from Andrew Symonds (91* from 118 balls, 7 fours, 1 six), demonstrating again captain Ricky Ponting's faith in him. Vaas, continuing his excellent tournament, took three wickets. Australia's pace attack then ripped through the Sri Lankan top order, with Brett Lee (3/35 in 8 overs) taking three early wickets and Glenn McGrath (1/20 in 7 overs) taking one. By the time rain arrived in the 39th over, continued tight bowling had squeezed Sri Lanka to 123 (7 wickets, 38.1 overs), well behind the target given by the Duckworth–Lewis method. This is the match in which Adam Gilchrist famously "walked" despite being given not out.
2007 Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
West Indies islands hosted the 9th Cricket World Cup , where Sri Lanka was lead by Mahela Jayawardena . The 12 teams were grouped into four groups, where Sri Lanka in group B. India, Bangladesh and Bermuda played with Sri Lanka in group matches. Bermuda's World Cup debut became the second-heaviest defeat at the World Cup, 40 runs worse than Scotland's defeat the day before. After Sri Lanka won the toss and batted, they scored 321/6 in 50 overs while skipper Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva all collected half-centuries. Kevin Hurdle took two wickets for Bermuda, but his second over lasted 14 balls due to no-balls and wides. Bermuda fell to 20 for four after Lasith Malinga had taken three wickets in three overs, ending with bowling figures of three for 10. With the seven first men down, Lionel Cann paired up with Delyone Borden for a 25-run partnership, the largest of the innings. Farveez Maharoof removed both before Murali had Dwayne Leverock lbw to end the innings for 78, Bermuda's lowest total ever in One-day Internationals. Sri Lanka won the match by 243 runs.
Next match for Sri Lanka was against Bangladesh, who won the match against India and was in good performance before coming to this match. But Bangladesh' chances of reaching the Super Eights by means of net run rate diminished after a 198-run defeat to Sri Lanka, the third-heaviest of their history and the largest since their 200-run defeat to India in 2003. Indeed, it was only due to the rain during Bangladesh' innings and the consequently readjusted target that the margin of victory was smaller; Bangladesh were bowled out for 112, with all the Sri Lankan bowlers except Jayasuriya taking wickets, but Jayasuriya had already contributed with seven sixes in his 24th One-day International century as Sri Lanka totalled 318 for four. Spinners Mohammad Rafique and Abdur Razzak were the only ones to keep the economy rate below five an over, while for Sri Lanka only Russel Arnold cost more than five an over. Four Sri Lankan batsmen outscored Bangladesh' top-scoring batsman, Mohammad Ashraful , who made 45 not out from number seven.
Last group match was against the neighbors-India, who was at brink of eliminating from the tournament. So the match was highly valuable to Indians than Lankans. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, went through to the second stage unbeaten, after newcomers to the team Upul Tharanga and Chamara Silva both struck half-centuries and Murali took three wickets, including wicket-keeper MS Dhoni for a duck.
Indian pacer Zaheer Khan started off with a wide, but also had Jayasuriya caught behind in his opening spell, striking at the end of the seventh over, and also had Tharanga in trouble with in-cutters. Tharanga, however, batted through nearly two thirds of the match for his 64, and none of the bowlers managed to keep the run rate below four as Sri Lanka made it to 254 for six, due to poor cricket from India. For Sri Lanka, Vaas struck twice within eleven overs, taking a return catch off Robin Uthappa and having Ganguly caught for a 23-ball seven. Tendulkar followed in the next over, bowled by Dilhara Fernando for his second duck of the tournament, but Virender Sehwag and skipper Rahul Dravid made it through the next ten overs, before the "turning point" arrived when Murali had Sehwag caught at first slip in his third over; the next six overs yielded only 14 runs and two more wickets, after Dhoni went lbw to Murali, and India needed 141 runs off 22 overs. Despite double-digit scores from Ajit Agarkar , Harbhajan Singh and Munaf Patel , they were bowled out for 185. India eliminated and Sri Lanka through to Super 8s.
Super 8s has gone pretty well for Sri Lankans, with their performances, only lost to South Africa and Australia. In the first Super 8 match for Sri Lanka vs South Africa, Malinga became the first bowler to take four wickets with four consecutive deliveries in international cricket. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat, and lost their first five wickets for 98, with Charl Langeveldt taking two in his first spell. Tillakaratne Dilshan and Russel Arnold built a sixth-wicket stand of 97 in nearly 20 overs, but Dilshan was caught off Makhaya Ntini 's bowling, and then Langeveldt took 3 in 5 balls as Sri Lanka were bowled out in the final over for 209. In reply, Vaas had AB de Villiers bowled in the first over, but Jacques Kallis added 95 with Graeme Smith and 65 with Herschelle Gibbs , leading South Africa to within four runs of victory with his 86. Then Lasith Malinga struck and show begun. His four-in-four had Shaun Pollock , Andrew Hall , Kallis and Ntini. Though South Africa managed a run off Vaas in the intermediate over. South Africa now needed three runs to win with one wicket in hand, and eleven deliveries went by before Robin Peterson got an outside edge to a Malinga ball, which went out of reach of slip and went fine for four. South Africa won the match by only 1 wicket, in a very tied game. With this feat, Lasith Malinga became the only bowler to get four consecutive wickets in four balls in any form of the game.
Next match was against the hosts-West Indies. The start of the match was delayed due to bad weather, but a full 50-over match was played, which resulted in West Indies' third defeat in four days. Jayasuriya and Jayawardene added 183 for the third wicket, before Dilshan came in and took 39 off 22 deliveries as the final eleven overs yielded 84 runs. In reply, West Indies needed 170 off 94 when Ramnaresh Sarwan was stumped off Jayasuriya; they only got 56 of those, and were bowled out for 190, with four batsmen out in single figures. Sri Lanka won the match by huge 113 runs.
Against England, the match was again became a nail biter. Sri Lanka batted first and made 235, bowled out off the last ball with a run out. England lost their openers for 0 and 10, but Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen made a stand of 90 for the third wicket, and skipper Paul Collingwood joined Pietersen to add a further 25 before Pietersen was caught and bowled by Murali. England then lost two more wickets for seven runs to Dilhara Fernando, and required 103 off 16.3 overs with four wickets in hand. However, Ravi Bopara scored a half-century in his fourth One-Day International innings, as he and Paul Nixon took England within three runs of victory. However, Fernando returned for the last over, and bowled Bopara off the last ball giving Sri Lanka victory. Sri Lanka won two of last three matches -won against New Zealand and Ireland, lost to Australia, secured their place to semi-finals.
In the semi, Sri Lanka met New Zealand again, where Sri Lanka scored 289/7 courtesy of century by skipper Jayawardena. New Zealand only scored 208 runs and eliminated from the World Cup. Sri Lanka selected for their second final in World Cups, against same opponent as in 1996-Australians. Aussie skipper Ricky Ponting won the toss and elected to bat. However, the start of play was delayed due to rain, and the match was reduced to 38 overs per side. Gilchrist played an incredible innings of 149 – the highest for any batsman in a World Cup final – to give Australia an imposing total going in at the break., but the innings was in controversy due to Gilchrist usage of squash ball inside the left glove.
While Sri Lankan batsmen Sangakkara and Jayasuriya were adding 116 for the second wicket, the contest was alive, but after the pair got out, Sri Lanka's chances slowly diminished. Further rain forced the reduction of Sri Lanka's innings to just 36 overs, with the target revised to 269. At the end of the 33rd over, with Sri Lanka still trailing the adjusted D/L target by 37 runs, the umpires suspended the game due to bad light. While Australia's players began to celebrate their victory (since the minimum 20 overs had been reached), the umpires incorrectly announced that because the match was suspended due to light and not rain, the final three overs would have to be bowled the following day. With Sri Lanka needing 61 runs from 18 deliveries, Jayawardene agreed there was no need to return the following day, and instructed his team to resume batting, with Ponting agreeing to play only spinners. The umpires later apologised for their error: the match should have ended then with Australia winning by 37 runs. The last three overs were played in almost complete darkness, during which Sri Lanka added just nine runs, giving Australia a 53-run victory by the D-L method, as Sri Lanka had batted two overs fewer than they had.

Canada bowled well in the early overs, but did not get a wicket, as openers Tharanga and Dilshan reached 50 runs. When the first wicket did fall, it was a run-out when the batsmen had a mix-up with the score at 63, and Tharanga was dismissed. Dilshan got to his half-century, but fell trying to go for a big hit. The Canadians restricted Sri Lanka to 88/2 with over 19 overs bowled; but the two experienced Sri Lankan batsmen, captain Sangakkara and Jayawardene came together and got a partnership of 50.

Jayawardene reached his century but fell immediately afterwards. More wickets fell and the game got hot-tempered, with a confrontation between Angelo Mathews and Harvir Baidwan and Sri Lanka finished with 332/7.
The Canadian chase went nowhere, with Thisara Perera and Nuwan Kulasekara getting three wickets quickly. Captain Ashish Bagai tried to lead a recovery, but once Perera took his wicket to reduce Canada to 53/5, all doubts about the result finished. Big-hitter Rizwan Cheema took 37, including two huge sixes off spinner Murali, but the latter ultimately got his wicket as Canada fell to 122 all out. Sri Lanka won the match by 210 runs.
Next match was with Pakistani team, which gave Lankans their first World Cup defeat in home soil. Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi won the toss and decided to bat first against Sri Lanka, one of the pre-tournament favorites.

Misbah stayed not out till the end for a well made 83, kept Pakistan to 277/7 at the end.
Sri Lanka started off with a very good reply, with their openers Tharanga and Dilshan accelerating steadily after a slow start to add 76 in just over 14 overs until Hafeez had Tharanga caught at point. This was the turning point of the match, as three more wickets, including that of Dilshan fell soon after to leave Sri Lanka tottering at 96/4. Sangakkara rode his luck with Kamran missing two stumpings off him, and staged a recovery with Chamara Silva, but his luck eventually ran out as the required run rate went up, with Afridi having him caught at long on one short of his fifty. Jayawadena was bowled by pacer Shoaib Akhtar with a magnificent in swing. Silva struggled to time the ball early in his innings, being 16 off 49 balls at one point, but he then accelerated rapidly to reach his half-century, but Afridi returned to remove dangerous looking Angelo Mathews. Silva eventually fell for 57 when Kamran did get a stumping right, and despite Kulasekara's cameo, Sri Lanka ended up 11 short.
In the next match against Kenyans, Malinga took a hat-trick, the second in his career. He became the first bowler to take two World Cup hat-tricks, and the fourth bowler to take two career ODI hat-tricks. Sri Lanka comfortably chased the target of 146b by giving one wicket only.

In reply, Zimbabwe made a good start, but were dismissed for 188 runs with 11 overs spare.

Skipper Sangakkara scored 111 runs and Lankans managed to get 265/9. Blackcaps were struggled from the very first ball, where they were all out for 153.
In the quarter finals, Sri Lankan counterpart was England. England total of 229 was easily reached by Dilshan and Tharanga. Both made centuries as Sri Lanka chased down a target by ten wickets.

This was the last match Murali played on Sri Lankan soil. Sri Lanka won the match by 5 wickets and reached their first consecutive World Cup final.
Sri Lanka started the innings slowly, constrained by good bowling from Zaheer and committed fielding from Yuvraj Singh , Suresh Raina , and Virat Kohli inside the 30-yard circle. Zaheer began with three consecutive maidens and the wicket of Tharanga, conceding only six runs in his five-over spell. Dilshan was bowled by Harbhajan when a delivery carried on to the stumps after deflecting off his gloves. Sangakkara came in after Tharanga's dismissal, and was building a solid foundation with Dilshan before the latter was dismissed. Jayawardene came to the crease when Sri Lanka were 60/2 in the 17th over. Sangakkara and Mahela went about the task of consolidating the innings, but eventually Sangakkara was caught behind by Dhoni at 48. New batsman Thilan Samaraweera was adjudged not out by the umpire when a ball hit his thigh pad off the bowling of Yuvraj Singh. The Indians decided to review the decision and he was ultimately given out. Chamara Kapugedera , who was playing his first World Cup match, was caught off a deceptive slower ball by Zaheer Khan. Jayawardene, meanwhile, continued with his quality batting, ultimately scoring 103 not out from 88 balls in a high-class batting display. Helped by the hard-hitting of Kulasekara and Thisara, Sri Lanka scored 91 runs in the last 10 overs, including 63 in the batting powerplay (45–50 overs) to take the score to 274/6.
India had a shaky start, with Sehwag and Tendulkar both early by Malinga, leaving them struggling at 31 for two. Kohli and Gautam Gambhir started the recovery with some fluent stroke play and quick running between wickets, taking India to 114 before Kohli was caught-and-bowled by Dilshan for 35. When he was on 30, Gambhir mistimed a shot off the bowling of Suraj Randiv , sending the ball high up in the air, but Kulasekara could not hold on to a difficult chance at long off. Kohli and Gambhir put together an 83-run partnership before Kohli's dismissal. Dhoni came in after Kohli to bat at number five. Gambhir and Dhoni added 109 for the fourth wicket with Gambhir scoring 97. Gambhir tried to finish his century with a boundary, but was bowled by Thisara.

This is the first World Twenty20 tournament held in an Asian country, the last three having been held in South Africa, England and the West Indies.

The Sri Lankan third consecutive World T20 semi-final was against Pakistanis. Sri Lanka scored 139/4, where Mahela paced the innings with his 42 runs. While chasing, skipper Mohammad Hafeez scored 40 runs, all the other players were undone by Rangana Herath.

They then restricted Sri Lanka to 39/1 after eight overs, produced two run outs and held each Sri Lankan batsman to no more than 33 (posted by captain Mahela Jayawardene). Kulasekara mustered a brief fightback (26 runs from 16 balls) but holed out to leave the tail end exposed, and Sri Lanka was soon all out 36 runs short. Samuels earned Man of the Match honors for being the top-scoring batsman on either side while also taking 1-15 in his four overs of bowling. For the first time, a host nation (Sri Lanka) competed in the final of the ICC World Twenty20. Ajantha Mendis was the highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets.
2014 ICC World Twenty20[ edit ]
As the runner-up of previous World T20 competition, Sri Lanka went Bangladesh under the captaincy of Dinesh Chandimal to this edition of World T20 . In the group stage at Super 10 stage, they played with South Africa, New Zealand, England, and Netherlands. In the first match, Sri Lanka played with South Africa. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat first. They had a good understanding about Bangladeshi pitches, due to Bangladesh bilateral tournament and 2014 Asia Cup , which was held prior to the World T20 at the same site. Sri Lankan opener Kusal Perera reminded all sorts of aggressive shots by legendary Sanath Jayasuriya. Kusal's master stroke was a photocopy of Jayasuriya and he devastated Dale Steyn , Morné Morkel , and Lonwabo Tsotsobe . He scored 61 runs off 40 balls giving Sri Lanka a total of 165/7. South Africans was not down as yet, where they progressively built the innings. With the wickets in crucial intervals, they ended up in the losing side with 5 runs short. Kusal was the Man-of-the-Match.
The next match was against talented Netherlands, who show their powerful strokes against Ireland in this tournament. But all those stroke play was undone by magnificent bowling by Mathews, Kulasekara, and Malinga. Dutch were all out for 39 runs, which is the lowest by any team in a T20I match . Sri Lanka chased this easy target by 5 overs, which also earns Biggest victory in terms of balls remaining in all T20I.
In the very next match against England, beat Sri Lanka by 6 wickets with courtesy of unbeaten 116 by Alex Hales . Sri Lanka batted first and scored 189/4. Mahela scored 89 runs. England always maintained the required run rate very well, which gave them a fast hitting in last few overs. England scored 190/4 in 19.2 and won the match.
The last group match was a thrilling match for the both teams, where Sri Lanka came as the favorites to win the match. Skipper Chandimal was out of play due to some injuries, so Lasith Malinga captained the match. By batting first, Sri Lanka scored only 119 all out, Mahela scored 25 runs as the best batsman. Blackcaps came to the crease as the favorites to win the match, because 120 is not a huge task at all to them as smashers - Brendon McCullum , Martin Guptill , Ross Taylor , and Corey Anderson . During the match, Anderson was injured and so New Zealand played with only 10 players in batting. New Zealand started pretty well with Guptill and Kane Williamson . At this time, Malinga decided to go with Rangana Herath , who turned the match in nowhere. Herath ball Guptill and he lunges forward to push to mid-on. Sets off for a single straight away but his partner is not at all interested. The bowler is wise to the mistake, rushes across to his right and cuts the ball in its path and sends in a rocket throw and Sangakkara whips the bails off. After this run-out, it wall all Herath. he stumped skipper McCullum, then caught Ross Taylor to lbw. Next, Herath bowled James Neesham in first ball he faced. He then captured Luke Ronchi for lbw, and New Zealand were never in the game. Finally New Zealand all out for just 60 runs, which is the lowest score by a test playing nation in Twenty20 Internationals. Herath finished with 5 wickets for 3 runs, earned him Man-of-the-match. With this win, Sri Lanka moved their fourth consecutive World T20 semi-finals.
The semi-finals was against defending World T20 champions- West Indies. Malinga again lead the team. But this time, Lankans were all over West Indies, where Sri Lanka scored 160/6. In chasing, West Indies was 80/4 when rain came into play. Rain and hail ended the match after 13.5 overs in the West Indies' innings. Their par score was 107 runs according to the Duckworth–Lewis method. So, Sri Lanka won by 27 runs in D/L method. At the presentation, West Indies skipper Darren Sammy stated that, "rain and god gave Sanga and Mehela" a big farewell party. This World Cup belongs to them. So, good luck to both of them". The final was not easy at all, with their opposition being a difficult one - India. The match was lead by Malinga for third time, where he gave permanent T20I captaincy.
Sri Lanka and India had played each other over sixty times in the last seven years, with India winning the majority of the matches. During the tournament India was the only unbeaten team heading into the final, whereas Sri Lanka had lost a group match to England. Despite this, statistically there had been little between the two teams during the tournament. India, sent into bat by Sri Lanka after they won the toss, posted 130 runs in their 20 overs. Virat Kohli top scored with 77, but Yuvraj Singh's 11 runs off 21 balls slowed the innings momentum in the final overs. Sri Lanka reached 134 runs in 17.5 overs with the loss of 4 wickets. Kumar Sangakkara, playing his last Twenty20 international match, guided Sri Lanka home with an unbeaten 52 runs. Sangakkara was named Player of the Match, while Kohli was named Player of the Tournament. After all losses in major World Cups in 4 times, Sri Lanka finally ended with Champions. With this match, Mahela and Sanga retired from twenty20 internationals. The words of Sammy became true at last.

Sri Lankan innings began with Thirimanne being dropped on 3. His opening partner Dilshan was out for 44 immediately after their partnership had reached 100 runs. Sangakkara joined Thirimanne and the left-hand duo punished the England bowlers with each of the batsmen making hundreds. Thirimanne struck a six off the third ball of the 48th over to complete an emphatic 9-wicket victory. Thirimanne remained unbeaten on a 143-ball 139, while Sangakkara won the Man of the Match for his unbeaten 117 off just 86 balls. This was Sangakkara second consecutive century.
The match against Australians was a real thriller. Australia batted first where they posted a huge 376/9, with the help of brutal 51 ball century of Glenn Maxwell . Sri Lanka chasing was not good at first, where Thirimanne was got out early. but then Dilshan joined Sangakkara to a 196 run partnership. Dilshan hit six fours off an over, bowled by Mitchell Johnson , which was the first time this has happened in World Cup history. After dismissal of Dilshan, the middle-order failed to gain partnerships with Sangakkara, who batting really well. Sangakkara scored his third consecutive century. With Sanga's wicket, Sri Lanka lost wickets quickly and scored 312/9 in 50 overs. Australia won the match by 64 runs. In the last group stage match, Sri Lanka easily defeated Scotland by 148 runs.

Sanga scored 45 runs and all the others were struggled by South African impressive bowling attack- Dale Steyn , Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir . South Africa won the match very easily, only one wicket fell. With this match, Sanga and Jayawardena ended their ODI career. This match gave Lankans, their first defeat without making for the semi-finals after 1999 World Cup.
Whitewashing[ edit ]

Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji Jadeja was an Indian who played for the English cricket team
The British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721. [4] In 1848, the Parsi community in Bombay formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians. After slow beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877. [5] By 1912, the Parsis, Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans every year. [5] In the early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for the England cricket team . Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and KS Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy – two major first-class tournaments in India. In 1911, an Indian team went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team. [6]
India was invited into The Imperial Cricket Council in 1926, and made their debut as a Test playing nation in England in 1932 , led by CK Nayudu , who was considered as the best Indian batsman at the time. [7] The one-off Test match between the two sides was played at Lord's in London . The team was not strong in their batting at this point and went on to lose by 158 runs. [8] In 1933, the first Test series in India was played between India and England with matches in Bombay, Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Madras (now Chennai). England won the series 2-0. [9] The Indian team continued to improve throughout the 1930s and '40s but did not achieve an international victory during this period. In the early 1940s, India didn't play any Test cricket due to the Second World War . The team's first series as an independent country was in late 1947 against Sir Donald Bradman 's Invincibles (a name given to the Australia national cricket team of that time). It was also the first Test series India played which was not against England. Australia won the five-match series 4–0, with Bradman tormenting the Indian bowling in his final Australian summer. [10] India subsequently played their first Test series at home not against England against the West Indies in 1948. West Indies won the 5-Test series 1-0. [11]
India recorded their first Test victory, in their 24th match, against England at Madras (now Chennai) in 1952. [12] Later in the same year, they won their first Test series, which was against Pakistan . [13] They continued their improvement throughout the early 1950s with a series win against New Zealand in 1956. However, they did not win again in the remainder of the decade and lost badly to strong Australian and English sides. The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home. They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961–62, and also won a home series against New Zealand . They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia, and another series against England. In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967–68.

The key to India's bowling in the 1970s were the Indian spin quartet – Bishen Bedi , E.A.S. Prasanna , BS Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan . This period also saw the emergence of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath . Indian pitches have had tendency to support spin and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups. These players were responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of Ajit Wadekar . Gavaskar scored 774 runs in the West Indian series while Dilip Sardesai 's 112 played a big part in their one Test win.

The advent of One Day International cricket in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world. However, India was not considerably strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defence-based approaches to batting. India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup. Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975, India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.
In contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and were particularly strong at home where their combination of stylish batsman and beguiling spinners were seen at their best. India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976 when they chased 403 to win thanks to 112 from Viswanath. This West Indian defeat is considered to be a watershed in the history of their cricket because it led to captain Clive Lloyd dispensing with spin altogether and relying entirely on a four-man pace attack. In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without an individual scoring a century. There were six fifties, the highest being 70 by Mohinder Amarnath . The innings was the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures.
During the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy Mohammed Azharuddin , Dilip Vengsarkar and all-rounder Ravi Shastri . India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and two-time defending champions West Indies in the final, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the Asia Cup and in 1985, won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the Indian subcontinent . India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the subcontinent for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India's best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers. Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark. Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets. The period was also marked by an unstable leadership, with Gavaskar and Kapil exchanging the captaincy several times.
With 619 wickets, Anil Kumble is the world's third highest wicket taker in Tests and India's highest Test and ODI wicket taker . [14]
The addition of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, Javagal Srinath , India's fastest bowler since Amar Singh made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the subcontinent while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the 1996 Cricket World Cup semifinal, the team underwent a year of change as Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid , later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's . Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998. With the captaincy burden removed, Tendulkar was the world's leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs, as India enjoyed a home Test series win over Australia, the best ranked team in the world. After failing to reach the semifinals at the 1999 Cricket World Cup , Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3–0 on a tour of Australia and then 2–0 at home to South Africa. Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again. Ganguly was appointed the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman Ajay Jadeja were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as "the Indian cricket's worst hour". However, the new core – Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly – swore not to let this happen to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times. And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era. [15]
Since 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements with the appointment of John Wright as India's first ever foreign coach . India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001. The series was famous for the Kolkata Test match, in which India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. Australian captain Steve Waugh labelled India as the "Final Frontier" as a result of his side's inability to win a Test series in India. [16] Victory in 2001 against the Australians marked the beginning of a dream run for India under their captain Ganguly, winning Test matches in Zimbabwe , Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. The England series is also known for India's highest ODI run-chase of 325 runs at Lord's which came in the Natwest ODI Series final against England. In the same year, India were joint-winners of the ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka, and then went to the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa where they reached the final only to be beaten by Australia . The 2003–04 season also saw India play out a Test series in Australia where they drew 1–1 with the world champions, and then win a Test and ODI series in Pakistan.

At the end of the 2004 season, India suffered from lack of form and fitness from its older players. A defeat in a following home Test series against Australia was followed by an ODI home series defeat against Pakistan followed by a Test series levelled 1–1. Greg Chad the feat in his 114th match, which are 17 matches less than Kapil Dev. [15] Walsh became the first bowler to reach 500 wickets in the history of Test cricket. He achieved the feat against South Africa in 2001, getting Jacques Kallis leg before wicket in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad . [16] Throughout his Test career, Walsh produced one of the greatest opening partnership with Curtly Ambrose as a bowler, and shared 421 wickets from 49 matches with the latter. [2] Walsh's 519 wickets in Test cricket was a record at that time, which was surpassed by Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan in 2004. [17]
Walsh's feats with the bat are rather less flattering, as indicated by an average of seven in both Test cricket and ODIs. He also holds the record for the most Test ducks (43), but also for the most "not outs" – 61 times. [2]
Walsh played 132 Tests and 205 ODI matches, and took 519 and 227 wickets respectively. [2] He took 22 five wicket hauls in Tests—of which five fifers came in the first 63 appearances and 17 in the later 69 appearances—and one in ODIs. [3] [18]
Retirement[ edit ]
During his Test career, spanned over seventeen years, Walsh bowled 5004.1 overs, captured 519 wickets at an average of 24.45 runs and at a strike rate of 57.55 in 132 Test matches. Cricket critics considered him that he was "one of the most admired cricketers of recent times and will long be remembered as one of the game's most revered players." [19] He played last time in Test cricket against South Africa in April 2001, a match West Indies won by 130 runs at Sabina Park , Kingston, Jamaica . He took six wickets for 103 runs in the match. [20] In ODIs, he took 227 wickets from 205 matches at an average of 30.47. [2] His last ODI came in January 2000, against New Zealand at Jade Stadium , Christchurch in which he took one wicket for 70 runs. [21]
Former West Indian captain Clive Lloyd attributed Walsh: "I don't think you'll find another Courtney Walsh around and if I was a young fast bowlers, I'd want to emulate him." [22] Former West Indian all-rounder Garry Sobers said about him that the "young crop of fast bowlers can take from him his dedication to West Indies and his ability to be always there, trying and giving 100 per cent in difficult conditions." [22]
Awards and honors[ edit ]
Walsh was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1987, and the cricket almanack Wisden noted his "three distinct speeds, all delivered with the same action", and his "sparing use of the bouncer, his shorter deliveries generally threatening the batsman's rib-cage, a tactic which, allied to change of pace, produced many catches in the short-leg area off splice or glove." [5] Walsh was selected as one of the Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year in 1988. [23] He was named one Jamaica's greatest cricketers of all time in 2004. [24]

History[ edit ]
Eden Park has been a sports ground since 1900. [4] The park began as a cricket ground in 1903, and was due to the vision of one Harry Ryan, a cricket enthusiast who approached landowner John Walters to lease part of his land as a sports field. In the book Eden Park: A History, the authors write, "Certainly the rough paddock strewn with stones, studded with outcrops of rock and streaked with cowpats, falling away to a boggy trough that filled in a downpour and remained flooded throughout the winter, looked better suited to frog-hunting or duck-shooting than cricket, let alone rugby. Ryan knew or at least imagined better." [7] That bit of land was in fact located just up the road from Cabbage Tree Swamp, now Gribblehirst Park.
Interestingly, those who saw Ryan's vision as madness most likely felt vindicated when, in 1907, massive downpours of rain saw the ground submerged in water for a week. The same thing happened again later in the year. Drainage problems were a scourge even as late as 1975 [8] when severe rain before the one-off test between the All Blacks and Scotland saw the event close to being called off with the drainage system unable to cope with the flooding.
In 1913 the park was leased to the Auckland Rugby Union so it became both a summer and winter sporting venue, and in 1921 hosted the first international event, a NZ v South Africa Test. The Western part of the ground was just open space until 1950 when a temporary stand was erected for the British Empire Games. In 1956 a permanent stand was built, but subsequently moved to North Harbour Stadium. [9]
The name ‘Eden Park’ settled into general usage around 1912, soon after it had been taken over by the Auckland Cricket Association (which was founded in 1883). Still the home of Auckland Cricket, Eden Park has hosted many international Tests , One Day International and Twenty/20 cricket matches.
Eden Park in 2005 prior to redevelopment
Rugby arrived in 1913 when, after negotiations with the Auckland Cricket Association, Auckland Rugby was granted a 21-year lease for games during the winter season. The first rugby test was held on 27 August 1921, when the Springboks beat the All Blacks 5–9 before a crowd of 40,000. The Auckland Rugby Football Union officially made Eden Park its home in 1925.
In 1926 a Trust was set up to manage Eden Park primarily for the benefit of Auckland Cricket and Auckland Rugby. The Trust still manages the Park.
Eden Park has hosted events over the years from the 1950 Empire Games, the Queen Mother’s visit in 1966, the infamous flour bombing test at the NZ v South Africa rugby game, to the Dalai Lama visit in 2002. And of course in more recent history, it has been the subject of the hotly debated dilemma leading up to the 2011 Rugby World Cup - should the event be hosted at historical Eden Park or a nice new waterfront stadium. [9]
In 2013 the New Zealand Warriors announced they would be playing three home games at Eden Park in the 2014 NRL season. [10]
In 2015, it hosted four matches during the 2015 Cricket World Cup , which was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand including the first semi final between New Zealand and South Africa . [6]

2015 The stadium hosted four matches during the 2015 Cricket World Cup , which was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand . The matches played here were two pool B games, the pool A clash between co-hosts New Zealand v Australia and the first semi final between New Zealand and South Africa . [6]
Capacity[ edit ]
The $256 million redevelopment completed in October 2010 provided a permanent capacity of 50,000 with a further 10,000 temporary seats for the 2011 Rugby World Cup games. [13] This is the largest of any New Zealand sports arena. There are no standing areas. Temporary seating in front of the North Stand and the West Stand (usually only used for international rugby matches) is required for the capacity to be reached. Due to sight-screens and the larger area required for cricket matches, cricket capacity is smaller.
Prior to redevelopment, Eden Park had a crowd capacity of 42,000 for cricket , and 47,500 for rugby. [14]

The redeveloppell took over from John Wright as the coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and his methods proved to be controversial during the beginning of his tenure. The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly, resulting in Rahul Dravid being made captain. This triggered a revival in the team's fortunes, following the emergence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina , and the coming of age of players like Irfan Pathan and Yuvraj Singh . A thumping home series victory over Sri Lanka in 2005 and a drawn series with South Africa put India at second place in the ICC ODI rankings. Dravid, Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were selected to play for the ICC World XI in the 2005 " SuperTest " against Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second. [17] Towards the middle of 2006, however, a 4–1 series loss in the West Indies gave rise to a slump in India's ODI form, while they achieved a 1–0 victory in the Test series that followed, giving them their first Test series victory in the Caribbean since 1971. India's ODI form slumped further with a disappointing performance in the 2006 Champions Trophy and a drubbing in the ODI series in South Africa. This was followed yet again by an initial good performance in the Tests, giving India its first Test match win in South Africa, although they went on to lose the series 2–1. This Test series was marked by Ganguly's comeback to the Indian team. [18]
In December 2006, India played and won its first ever Twenty20 international in South Africa, becoming the most recent Test team to play Twenty20 cricket. The beginning of 2007 had seen a revival in the Indian team's ODI fortunes before the 2007 Cricket World Cup . Series victories against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, marked by the comeback of Ganguly, and strong form by Tendulkar, and the emergence of young players like Robin Uthappa saw many pundits to tip India as a real contender to win the 2007 Cricket World Cup . However, defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw India fail to reach the second round. After winning the Test series against England in August 2007, Dravid stepped down as the captain of the team following which Dhoni was made the captain of the Twenty20 and ODI team. In September 2007, India won the first-ever Twenty20 World Cup held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by 5 runs in the final. In 2007–08, they toured Australia where India lost the controversial Test series 2–1, but managed to win the CB series the following month with a whitewash final of Australia. [19]
In April 2009, India secured their first Test series win in New Zealand in 41 years. After beating Sri Lanka 2–0 in December 2009, India became the No. 1 Test team in the world. They retained the ranking by drawing series against South Africa and Sri Lanka. In October 2010, India whitewashed Australia 2–0 in the home Test series, giving them back-to-back series wins against them. Later that year, India managed to draw the Test series in South Africa at 1–1. [20]

For more details on this topic, see History of the England cricket team to 1939 and History of the England cricket team from 1945 .
The first England team to tour Southern Australia
The first recorded incidence of a team with a claim to represent England comes from 9 July 1739 when an "All-England" team, which consisted of 11 gentlemen from any part of England exclusive of Kent , played against "the Unconquerable County" of Kent and lost by a margin of "very few notches". [8] Such matches were repeated on numerous occasions for the best part of a century.
In 1846 William Clarke formed the All-England Eleven . This team would eventually compete against a United All-England Eleven with annual matches occurring between 1847 to 1856. These matches were arguably the most important contest of the English season, if judged by the quality of the players.
Early tours[ edit ]
The first overseas tour occurred in September 1859 with England touring North America. This team had six players from the All-England Eleven, six from the United All-England Eleven and was captained by George Parr .
With the outbreak of the American Civil War , attention turned elsewhere. English tourists visited Australia in 1861-62 with this first tour organised as a commercial venture by Messrs Spiers and Pond, restaurateurs of Melbourne . Most matches played during tours prior to 1877 were "against odds", with the opposing team fielding more than 11 players to make for a more even contest. [9] This first Australian tour were mostly against odds of at least 18/11.
The tour was so successful that George Parr led a second tour in 1863–64 . James Lillywhite led a subsequent England team which sailed on the P&O steamship Poonah on 21 September 1876. They would play a combined Australian XI, for once on even terms of 11 a side. The match, starting on 15 March 1877 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground came to be regarded as the inaugural Test match. The combined Australian XI won this Test match by 45 runs with Charles Bannerman of Australia scoring the first Test century. At the time, the match was promoted as James Lillywhite's XI v Combined Victoria and New South Wales. [9] The teams played a return match on the same ground at Easter, 1877, when Lillywhite's team avenged their loss with a victory by four wickets. The first Test match on English soil occurred in 1880 with England victorious; this was the first time England fielded a fully representative side with W.G. Grace included in the team. [10]
The Ashes[ edit ]
England lost their first home series 1–0 in 1882 with The Sporting Times printing an obituary on English cricket:
“
In Affectionate Remembrance of ENGLISH CRICKET, which died at the Oval on 29th AUGUST 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances R.I.P. N.B. – The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia. [11]
”
As a result of this loss the tour of 1882–83 was dubbed by England captain Ivo Bligh as "the quest to regain the ashes". England with a mixture of amateurs and professionals won the series 2–1. [12] Bligh was presented with an urn that contained some ashes, which have variously been said to be of a bail , ball or even a woman's veil and so The Ashes was born. A fourth match was then played which Australia won by 4 wickets but the match was not considered part of the Ashes series. [12] [13] England would dominate many of these early contests with England winning the Ashes series 10 times between 1884 and 1898. [14] During this period England also played their first Test match against South Africa in 1889 at Port Elizabeth . [15]
The 1899 Ashes series was the first tour where the MCC and the counties appointed a selection committee. There were three active players: Lord Hawke , W. G. Grace and Herbert Bainbridge who was the captain of Warwickshire. Prior to this, England teams for home Tests had been chosen by the club on whose ground the match was to be played.
The start of the 20th century saw mixed results for England as they lost four of the eight Ashes series between 1900 and 1914. [16] During this period England would lose their first series against South Africa in the 1905–06 season 4–1 as their batting faltered. [17] The 1912 season saw England take part in a unique experiment. A nine Test triangular tournament involving England, South Africa and Australia was set up. The series was hampered by a very wet summer and player disputes however and the tournament was considered a failure with the Daily Telegraph stating: [18]
“
Nine Tests provide a surfeit of cricket, and contests between Australia and South Africa are not a great attraction to the British public.
”
With Australia sending a weakened team and the South African bowlers being ineffective England dominated the tournament winning four of their six matches. The Australia v South Africa match, at Lord's, was notable for a visit by King George V , the first time a reigning monarch had watched Test cricket. [19] England would go on one more tour against South Africa before the outbreak of World War I.
Inter-war period[ edit ]
England's first match after the war was in the 1920–21 season against Australia. Still feeling the effects of the war England went down to a series of crushing defeats, and suffered their first whitewash losing the series 5–0. Six Australians scored hundreds while Mailey spun out 36 English batsmen. Things were no better in the next few Ashes series losing the 1921 Ashes series 3–0 and the 1924–5 Ashes 4–1. England's fortunes were to change in 1926 as they regained the Ashes and were a formidable team during this period dispatching Australia 4–1 in the 1928–29 Ashes tour.
On the same year the West Indies became the fourth nation to be granted Test status and played their first game against England. England won each of these three Tests by an innings, and a view was expressed in the press that their elevation had proved a mistake although Learie Constantine did the double on the tour. In the 1929–30 season England went on two concurrent tours with one team going to New Zealand (who were granted Test status earlier that year) and the other to the West Indies. Despite sending two separate teams England won both tours beating New Zealand 1–0 and the West Indies 2–1.
Bill Woodfull evades a Bodyline ball. Note the number of leg-side fielders.
The 1930 Ashes series saw a young Don Bradman dominate the tour, scoring 974 runs in his seven Test innings. He scored 254 at Lord's, 334 at Headingley and 232 at the Oval. Australia regained the Ashes winning the series 3–1. As a result of Bradman's prolific run-scoring the England captain Douglas Jardine chose to develop the already existing leg theory into fast leg theory, or bodyline, as a tactic to stop Bradman. Fast leg theory involved bowling fast balls directly at the batsman's body. The batsman would need to defend himself, and if he touched the ball with the bat, he risked being caught by one of a large number of fielders placed on the leg side.
English cricket team at the Test match held at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground . England won the match by a record margin of 675 runs.
Using his fast leg theory England won the next Ashes series 4–1. But complaints about the Bodyline tactic caused crowd disruption on the tour, and threats of diplomatic action from the Australian Cricket Board , which during the tour sent the following cable to the MCC in London:
“
Bodyline bowling assumed such proportions as to menace best interests of game, making protection of body by batsmen the main consideration. Causing intensely bitter feeling between players as well as injury. In our opinion is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once likely to upset friendly relations existing between Australia and England.
”
Later, Jardine was removed from the captaincy and the laws of cricket changed so that no more than one fast ball aimed at the body was permitted per over, and having more than two fielders behind square leg were banned.
England's following tour of India in the 1933–34 season was the first Test match to be staged in the subcontinent. The series was also notable for Morris Nichols and Nobby Clark bowling so many bouncers that the Indian batsman wore solar topees instead of caps to protect themselves.
Australia won the 1934 Ashes series 2–1 and would keep the urn for the following 19 years. Many of the wickets of the time were friendly to batsmen resulting in a large proportion of matches ending in high scoring draws and many batting records being set.
The 1938–39 tour of South Africa saw another experiment with the deciding Test being a timeless Test that was played to a finish. England lead 1–0 going into the final timeless match at Durban. Despite the final Test being 'timeless', the game ended in a draw after 10 days as England had to catch the train to catch the boat home. A record 1,981 runs were scored, and the concept of timeless Tests was abandoned. England would go in one final tour of the West Indies in 1939 before World War II , although a team for an MCC tour of India was selected more in hope than expectation of the matches being played.
Post-war period[ edit ]
After World War II, England fell under difficult times suffering a heavy defeat 3–0 to Australia. This was followed by a 4–0 loss to Bradman's 'invincibles' and a stunning 2–0 loss to the West Indies. These loses were tempered by victories against India and South Africa.
Their fortunes would change in the 1953 Ashes tour as they won the series 1–0. England would not lose a series between their 1950–51 and 1958–59 tours of Australia and secured famous victory in 1954–55 thanks to Typhoon Tyson whose 6–85 at Sydney and 7–27 at Melbourne are remembered as the fastest bowling ever seen in Australia. The 1956 series was remembered for the bowling of Jim Laker who took 46 wickets at 9.62 which included bowling figures of 19/90 at Old Trafford . After drawing to South Africa, England defeated the West Indies and New Zealand comfortably. The England team would then leave for Australia in the 1958–59 season with a team that had been hailed as the strongest ever to leave on an Ashes tour but lost the series 4–0 as Richie Benaud 's revitalised Australians were too strong.
The early and middle 1960s were poor periods for English cricket. Despite England's strength on paper, Australia held the Ashes and the West Indies dominated England in the early part of the decade. However, from 1968 to 1971 they played 27 consecutive Test matches without defeat, winning 9 and drawing 18 (including the abandoned Test at Melbourne in 1970–71). The sequence began when they drew with Australia at Lords in the Second Test of the 1968 Ashes series and ended in 1971 when India won the Third Test at the Oval by 4 wickets. They played 13 Tests with only one defeat immediately beforehand and so played a total of 40 consecutive Tests with only one defeat, dating from their innings victory over the West Indies at The Oval in 1966. During this period they beat New Zealand, India, the West Indies, Pakistan and, under Ray Illingworth 's determined leadership, regained The Ashes from Australia in 1970–71.
1971 to 2000[ edit ]
The 1970s, for the England team, can be largely split into three parts. The early 70s saw Ray Illingworth 's side dominate world cricket winning the Ashes away in 1971 and then retaining them at home in 1972. The same side beat Pakistan at home in 1971 and played by far the better cricket against India that season. However, England were largely helped by the rain to sneak the Pakistan series 1–0 but the same rain saved India twice and one England collapse saw them lose to India. This was, however, one of (if not the) strongest England team ever with Boycott, Edrich, D'Oliveira, Amiss, Illingworth, Knott, Snow, Underwood amongst its core.
The mid-1970s were more turbulent. Illingworth and several others had refused to tour India in 1972–73 which led to a clamour for Illingworth's job by the end of that summer – England had just been thrashed 2–0 by a flamboyant West Indies side – with several England players well over 35. Mike Denness was the surprising choice but only lasted 18 months; his results against poor opposition were good but England were badly exposed as ageing and lacking in good fast bowling against the 1974–75 Australians, losing that series 4–1 to lose the Ashes.
Denness was replaced in 1975 by Tony Greig . While he managed to avoid losing to Australia, his side were largely thrashed the following year by the young and very much upcoming West Indies for whom Greig's infamous "grovel" remark acted as motivation. Greig's finest hour was probably the 1976–77 win over India in India. When Greig was discovered as being instrumental in World Series Cricket, he was sacked, and replaced by Mike Brearley .
Brearley's side showed again the hyperbole that is often spoken when one side dominates in cricket. While his side of 1977–80 contained some young players who went on to become England greats, most notably future captains Ian Botham , David Gower and Graham Gooch , their opponents were often very much weakened by the absence of their World Series players, especially in 1978, when England beat New Zealand 3–0 and Pakistan 2–0 before thrashing what was probably Australia's 3rd XI 5–1 in 1978–79.
The England team, with Brearley's exit in 1980, was never truly settled throughout the 1980s, which will probably be remembered as a low point for the team. While some of the great players like Botham, Gooch and Gower had fine careers, the team seldom succeeded in beating good opposition throughout the decade and did not score a home Test victory (except against minnows Sri Lanka) between September 1985 and July 1990. In this time, undoubted highlights were the Ashes victories of 1981 "Botham's Ashes", 1985 and 1986–87. The 1985 and 1986–87 victories, while sweet for the team, exposed more Australia's weakness than England's strength.
If the 1980s were a low point for English Test cricket then the 1990s were only a slight improvement. The arrival of Graham Gooch as captain in 1990 forced a move toward more professionalism and especially fitness, though it took some time for old habits to die. Even in 2011, one or two successful county players have been shown up as physically unfit for international cricket. Creditable performances against India and New Zealand in 1990 were followed by a hard fought draw against the 1991 West Indies but landmark losses against Australia in 1990–91 and especially Pakistan in 1992 showed England up badly in terms of bowling. So bad was England's bowling in 1993 that Rodney Marsh described England's pace attack at one point as "pie throwers". Having lost three of the first four Tests played in England in 1993 Graham Gooch resigned to be replaced by Mike Atherton .
More selectorial problems abounded during Atherton's reign as new chairman of selectors / coach Ray Illingworth (then into his 60s) assumed almost sole responsibility for the team off the field. The youth policy which had seen England emerge from the West Indies tour of 1993–94 with some credit (though losing to a seasoned WIndies team) was abandoned and players such as Gatting and Gooch were persisted with when well into their 30s and 40s. England duly continued to do well at home against weaker opponents such as India, New Zealand and a West Indies side beginning to fade but struggled badly against improving sides like Pakistan and South Africa. Atherton had offered his resignation after losing the 1997 Ashes series 3–2 having been 1–0 up after 2 matches – eventually to resign one series later in early 1998. England, looking for talent, went through a whole raft of new players during this period, such as Ronnie Irani , Adam Hollioake , Craig White , Graeme Hick , Mark Ramprakash . At this time, there were two main problems:
The lack of a genuine all-rounder to bat at 6, Ian Botham having left a huge gap in the batting order when he had retired from Tests in 1992.
Alec Stewart , a sound wicket-keeper and an excellent player of quick bowling, could not open and keep wicket, hence his batting down the order, where he was often exposed to spin which he didn't play as well.
Alec Stewart took the reins as captain in 1998 but another losing Ashes series and early World Cup exit cost him Test and ODI captaincy in 1999. This should not detract from the 1998 home Test series where England showed great fortitude to beat a powerful South African side 2–1.
Another reason for their poor performances were the demands of County Cricket teams on their players, meaning that England could rarely field a full strength team on their tours. This would eventually lead to the ECB taking over the MCC as the governing body of England and the implementation of central contracts. 1992 also saw Scotland sever ties with the England and Wales team, and begin to compete independently as the Scotland national cricket team .
By 1999, with coach David Lloyd resigning after the World Cup exit and new captain Nasser Hussain just appointed, England hit rock bottom (literally ranked as lowest-rated Test nation) after losing in shambolic fashion to New Zealand 2–1. Hussain was booed on the Oval balcony as the crowd jeered "We've got the worst team in the world" to the tune of " He's Got the Whole World in His Hands ".
2000 to 2010[ edit ]
One year later, with central contracts now installed reducing players workloads and the arrival of Zimbabwean coach Duncan Fletcher , England had thrashed the fallen West Indies 3–1 . England's results in Asia improved markedly that winter with series wins against both Pakistan and Sri Lanka though one-day success still eluded them.
England's fortunes improved under the new management – not without the occasional "blip" particularly against Australia but home Test wins became commonplace. Hussain's side had a far harder edge to it, even managing to avoid the anticipated "Greenwash" in the 2001 Ashes series against the all-powerful Australian team. The nucleus of a side of fighters was slowly coming together as players such as Hussain himself, Graham Thorpe , Darren Gough and Ashley Giles began to be regularly selected. By 2003 though, having endured another Ashes drubbing as well as another first-round exit from the World Cup , Hussain felt he could not continue and resigned after one Test against South Africa , though carried on as a batsman until 2004.
Michael Vaughan took over and, while keeping the emphasis as Hussain on fitness and control, encouraged players to express themselves. This especially brought the best out of Andrew Flintoff who, in a career blighted by serious injury managed a real purple patch of 18 months from 2004 to 2005 in which England won five consecutive test series prior to facing Australia in the 2005 Ashes series , taking the team to second place in the ICC Test Championship table. During this period England defeated the West Indies home and away , New Zealand , and Bangladesh at home, and South Africa in South Africa.
In June 2005, England played its first ever T20 international match , defeating Australia by 100 runs .
Later that year, England defeated Australia 2–1 in a thrilling series to regain the Ashes for the first time in 16 years having lost them in 1989. Following the 2005 Ashes win, the team suffered from a spate of serious injuries to key players such as Vaughan, Flintoff, Giles and Simon Jones . As a result, the team underwent an enforced period of transition. A 2–0 defeat in Pakistan was followed by two drawn away series with India and Sri Lanka .
In the home Test series victory against Pakistan in July and August 2006, several promising new players emerged. Most notable were the left-arm orthodox spin bowler Monty Panesar , the first Sikh to play Test cricket for England; and left-handed opening batsman Alastair Cook . Meanwhile, England's injury problems allowed previously marginal Test players such as Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell to consolidate their places in the team.
The 2006–07 Ashes series was keenly anticipated and was expected to provide a level of competition comparable to the 2005 series. In the event, England, captained by Flintoff who was deputising for the injured Vaughan, lost all five Tests to concede the first Ashes whitewash in 86 years.
England's form in ODIs had been consistently poor. They only narrowly avoided the ignominy of having to play in the qualifying rounds of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy . Despite this, in the ODI triangular in Australia, England recorded its first ODI tournament win overseas since 1997. But, in the 2007 Cricket World Cup , England lost to most of the Test playing nations they faced, beating only the West Indies and Bangladesh , although they also avoided defeat by any of the non-Test playing nations. Even so, the unimpressive nature of most of their victories in the tournament, combined with heavy defeats by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, left many commentators criticising the manner in which the England team approached the one-day game. Coach Duncan Fletcher resigned after eight years in the job as a result and was succeeded by former Sussex pment project included a three-tier South stand replacing the old South and West stands, with a capacity of 24,000, and a three-tier East replacing the Terraces. The number of covered seats increased from 23,000 to 38,000. The redeveloped Eden Park has an internal concourse that allows people to circulate around the grounds inside the stadium, and world-class facilities, including food and beverage outlets, toilets and corporate areas, were incorporated. The open plan approach to the design and establishment of a community centre and green space, and the removal of the perimeter fence , mean that the stadium has become more publicly accessible and a part of the neighbourhood.
There were public concerns about the height of the new structure and its shading effect on many nearby houses. Auckland City Council received 470 submissions on the resource consent application, over 300 of which were in favour of the redevelopment. On 26 January 2007, Eden Park received resource consent with 91 conditions imposed. The consent permitted the building of new stands in place of the terraces and south stand, but did not include consent for the NZ$385 million 'full option', which would have included covered seating. [15]
Possible alternative stadium for the Rugby World Cup[ edit ]
In September 2006 it was announced that instead of Eden Park, the Government and Auckland City Council were assessing the possibility of a new stadium on Auckland's waterfront to host the 2011 Rugby World Cup . [16] This assessment was part of the Government's formal due diligence process on the decision to redevelop Eden Park. The Government had said it would assist with the funding if a new stadium was built. The Government announced in a report in November 2006 that it would favour a new stadium on the Auckland waterfront, which would have meant that the Eden Park redevelopment would not have gone ahead, and that options for its use or redevelopment would have to be developed. After the Auckland City Council and the Auckland Regional Council differed in their support for the new stadium, the Government changed to supporting the redevelopment of Eden Park, subject to suitable resolution of the design, funding and governance issues. [17]
Rugby union[ edit ]
Eden Park is the home ground for the Auckland ITM Cup Team and the Auckland Blues , the region's Super Rugby franchise. The ground regularly hosts All Blacks tests. Auckland Rugby first used the ground in the 1913 season and the first international fixture was against South Africa in 1921.
The final game of the 1981 Springbok Tour was played at Eden Park. A low-flying Cessna 172 piloted by Marx Jones and Grant Cole dropped flour bombs on the field as part of widespread protests against the tour and apartheid.
Eden Park was used in the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup and the 2011 Rugby World Cup , the first ground to host two Rugby World Cup finals. [5]

Eden Park is the home ground for the Auckland cricket team . The ground regularly hosts international fixtures, including Tests , ODIs and Twenty20s .
It first hosted a test in 1930. The ground was also the host to New Zealand 's first Test victory, against West Indies in 1955-56 season. Infact, it has also been the scene of a dark day in New Zealand's cricket history when on 28 March 1955, the hosts collapsed to their lowest Test score(26 all out) against England . It is scheduled to host test cricket in March 2017. [2]
The ground hosted four matches during the 1992 Cricket World Cup including the semi-final between New Zealand and Pakistan . It also hosted four matches during the 2015 Cricket World Cup , which was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand . The matches played here were two pool B games, the pool A clash between co-hosts New Zealand and Australia and the first semi final between New Zealand and South Africa . [6]

World Cup matches[ edit ]



Domestic career[ edit ]
Awana made his first-class debut for Delhi against Himachal Pradesh in 2007. He played five games that season and picked up 12 wickets. He impressed in the next season, picking up 28 wickets from 7 matches at an average of 24. He also got two five-wicket hauls and a ten-for that season. He was dropped from the team during the 2010/11 Ranji Trophy as he failed to get enough wickets. However, he had a highly impressive first-class season in 2011/12. He had 35 scalps to his name from just 7 matches at an average of 25, picking three five-fors. His good bowling was rewarded as he was selected to play for North Zone in the 2011/12 Deodhar Trophy . He continued his brilliant bowling in the one-day format too, as he got figures of 6/49 against Central Zone in the only match he played that tournament before joining the Kings XI Punjab squad for IPL 2012 .
International career[ edit ]
He was picked in the national squad for the fourth Test against England and made his Twenty20 International debut against the touring English side in December 2012. [4]

Domestic career[ edit ]
Saha made it through the ranks of the youth system, playing for the Under-19s and the Under-22s team before stepping up to first-class cricket . Saha made his one-day debut in the Ranji Trophy competition of 2006/07, against Assam . While he did not get the chance to perform with the bat during this game, he scored a duck in his debut innings in the following match. As he was nearing the end of his brief run in the Ranji Trophy, he played three one-day games for the East Zone in the Deodhar Trophy .
Saha made his first-class debut in the 2007-08 Ranji Trophy, against Hyderabad he scored 111 not out , becoming the 15th Bengal player to score a hundred on Ranji debut. Saha also made the East Zone team in the Duleep Trophy in the 2007-08 season.
Saha’s incredible century for Bengal on his Ranji debut shot him to fame and was significantly important in landing a contract with IPL for the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2008. Saha played a major part of the tournament – thanks to the 4 foreigners rule and in the process displayed his batting talents besides his athleticism behind the stumps.
Saha was named in the India A squad which played three limited overs match against the Israel Invitational XI, players made the side on the basis of his performances in the Indian Premier League . India A won the series 3-0, Saha scored an unbeaten 85 in the third match in which India chased 235.
Test career[ edit ]
On 28 January 2010, Saha was included in the Indian Test squad as a reserve wicket-keeper in place of Dinesh Karthik for the upcoming home Test match series against South Africa . Although the squad was named for the first Test only, Saha's surprise inclusion raised a number of eyebrows.
As Saha was a reserve gloveman, he was not expected to play, but V. V. S. Laxman failed to recover from injury and Rohit Sharma , the only reserve specialist batsman in the squad, injured himself playing football in the warm-up on the first morning. As another batsman could not be flown in on time, Saha was given his Test debut against South Africa on 6 February 2010 at Nagpur in unintended circumstances and had to play as a specialist batsman.
He scored a duck in the first innings but he scored a watchful 36 in the second innings. In both innings, fast bowler Dale Steyn took his wicket. India lost the Test and Saha was dropped from the squad for the second Test which India subsequently won to level the two-match series.
Saha played in the fourth match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy in January 2012 in place of MS Dhoni ,who was banned for slow over rate, where he made an important 35 in the first which help Virat Kohli to get his maiden Test Century.
He also tour South Africa in December 2013, New Zealand in February 2014 and England in July 2014 as part of the test squad but did not get a game.
On 9 December 2014, He selected to play his first test match since January 2012 against Australia at the same ground where he played his last match because MS Dhoni was out with a he aim is both to get more pace and to deliver it later so as to deceive the batsman in flight. It is usually recommended to deliver the ball with some inswing but an away-swinging yorker aimed at the pads can be just as effective. Because yorkers are quite difficult to bowl they require substantial practice to achieve consistent success.

Kirsten made his Test debut against Australia in Melbourne in 1993. He retired from international cricket in 2004 after crafting a match-winning 76 in his final innings, against New Zealand . Against the same country he had made history by becoming the first-ever Protea to play in 100 Test matches.
Over the years, he gained a reputation as being a sturdy batsman in both Test cricket and One Day cricket. He could up the tempo of an innings if he needed to, but more often than not he simply waited for the bad ball, much like Steve Waugh and Justin Langer . He was also a reliable fielder. Kirsten held the South African records for most runs and centuries in a Test career, before both were surpassed by Jacques Kallis . He was the first Test batsman to make hundreds against each of the other 9 Test nations. He scored 275 runs against England as a result of batting for over 14 and a half hours as South Africa followed on at Kingsmead in Durban, it still stands as the second-longest innings (in terms of duration) in Test history. [2] The high score was later surpassed by Graeme Smith when he made 277 against England in 2003. He still holds the record for highest innings by a South African in a One Day International; 188 not-out made against the United Arab Emirates during the 1996 World Cup , which is the tenth [3] highest innings of all time in One Day International cricket, and the highest score in World Cup cricket history . This record stood until it was surpassed by Chris Gayle who scored 215 against Zimbabwe in 2015. Later, that record was surpassed by Martin Guptill who scored 237* against the West Indies in the quarter finals of that very World Cup.
Coaching career[ edit ]
India (2008–2011)[ edit ]
After retirement, Kirsten organized his own cricket academy. [4] In November 2007, it emerged that Kirsten was a candidate for the vacant post of coach of the India team. [5] The BCCI offered him a two-year contract for the post, and despite voicing reservations [6] about concerns he had about having the full support of India players, he confirmed he would be taking the job on 4 December. [7]
He officially started as coach on 1 March 2008. However, he travelled to Australia with India beforehand during the test series. His first full series in charge was against his home country, South Africa in March–April 2008 which was drawn 1–1. Also, he coached India to the finals of the Kitply Cup and 2008 Asia Cup (India lost both the finals). During his tenure as Coach of India, Indian cricket team won a home series against Australia beating them 2–0. Apart from clinching the Border-Gavaskar trophy , he also coached India to its first bilateral series win in Sri Lanka against Sri Lanka and India's first Test and One-Day International series victories against New Zealand in New Zealand after 40 years. India also won the Compaq Cup, defeating Sri Lanka in the finals on 14 September 2009 by 46 runs. A highly accomplished batsman himself, he has brought in a considerable amount of improvement in the batting performances, which is largely associated with his ability to instill better confidence among younger players.
Gary Kirsten has been praised by all players for improving/enhancing their playing techniques, motivating them and discussing tactics that can be deployed on the field. The results could be clearly seen within months. He is considered the key force behind the clearly visible performance improvement in all players. In 2010, Prior to the start of India's tour of South Africa, Indian captain M.S. Dhoni described him as "The best thing to happen to Indian cricket."
World Cup 2011[ edit ]
After the tour of South Africa, which India drew 1–1 in the Test series lost 3–2 in ODIs, Kirsten announced he would not renew his contract with BCCI because of family commitments. Kirsten often stated that he wanted to spend time with his two growing sons, Joshua and James, and wife and said three years away from home was long enough. Immediately after the announcement Kirsten was linked with joining South Africa as their coach as the South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl also announced his contract would end after the World Cup as well. [8] Kirsten ended his tenure as coach after India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets and 10 balls to spare on 2nd April 2011 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India. During the celebration, he was carried around the ground by Suresh Raina , Yusuf Pathan and Virat Kohli to show their respect.
Gary Kirsten cleared the air of any rumours about a renewal in contract by adopting a modest approach on his further availability as coach to the Indian team by stating that he wanted to say goodbye to India to spend time with his family.
South Africa (2011–2013)[ edit ]
On 5 June 2011 Kirsten was appointed the full-time coach of the South Africa national cricket team for a term period of two years. His first decision was to name AB De Villiers as the new captain for the limited overs game, replacing Graeme Smith who remains as the Test side captain. Kirsten began his term as coach on 1 August and his first assignment was a home series against Australia. He took over from Corrie van Zyl , who was an interim coach for 14 months after Mickey Arthur resigned following the home series against England in 2009–10. Under Kirsten, in August 2012, the South African team reached number 1 in the ICC Test rankings, by defeating England 2–0.
He did not renew his contract with Cricket South Africa (CSA) and has step down as the coach of the national team in August 2013 citing family commitments. He has been signed as the head coach of the Delhi based IPL team Delhi Daredevils for a three-year contract beginning from the IPL's \Eleventh edition. [1]
Business interests[ edit ]
In 2007, Kirsten joined Paddy Upton and Dale Williams to form a company called Performance Zone. [9] The focus of the company is to work with individuals and teams in business and sport, bringing out their clients' best performance. When Kirsten was appointed Indian coach and Upton Indian Mental conditioning coach on a two-year contract, they decided to continue the business. Its first project, post Kirsten taking on the Indian coach role, is the creation of garykirsten.com. [10]

England v India, 3rd Test, Edgbaston, 4th day August 13, 2011
England dethrone India to become No.1
ESPNcricinfo staff

May-June 2011 - Beat Sri Lanka 1-0
July-August 2011 - Lead India 3-0
England have claimed the No. 1 spot for the first time under the current rankings system which has been in place since 2003, thanks to an unassailable 3-0 lead in the ongoing Test series against India at home. England, who were No. 3 at the start of the series, had to win the series by a margin of two Tests to become No. 1, and their three straight wins - all of them by big margins - have dethroned India, who reigned since December 2009.
The climb to the top received a boost in 2009 when England reclaimed the Ashes at home after suffering a series defeat to West Indies in the Caribbean. They drew a series in South Africa after that, beat Pakistan comprehensively at home and retained the Ashes with a 3-1 win in Australia in 2010-11. Prior to beating India, they won 1-0 against Sri Lanka at home. Since May 2009 , they've won 19 out of the 30 Tests they've played with just four defeats and without conceding a series.
The ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat led the praises for Andrew Strauss's team. "On behalf of the ICC, I would like to congratulate Andrew Strauss, Andy Flower and the whole team for becoming the number-one ranked Test team in the world," Lorgat said in a release that was issued seconds after England's innings win at Edgbaston. "I know they were determined to be number-one and through careful planning and a series of clinical performances, they have deservedly achieved their goal. They were clearly the most consistent side in the world over the past few years."
The rankings table will be updated after the Oval Test which will end on August 22. If England win the Test, India will drop to third place - to 117 points from 119 currently, with South Africa moving to second. A win or a draw for India will keep them at No. 2. At the end of the series, England will be presented with a mace for reaching the top spot.

Domestic and first-class career
Ishant plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and has taken 68 wickets in 14  first-class games, [9] [10] including a five-wicket haul against Baroda on the opening day of a match Delhi drew after failing to bowl Baroda out on the fourth day. [11]
Ishant toured England with the India Under-19s in 2006 and Pakistan in 2006–07. He played three youth tests and six youth One Day Internationals for India. On the basis of his strong performance in Australia in 2008, Ishant Sharma was bought for a winning bid of $950,000 by Kolkata Knight Riders in the player auction for the Indian Premier League . This was the highest amount paid for any bowler in tournament.
International career
Ishant Sharma in 2008
In May 2007, Sharma was selected in the test team for the Bangladesh tour and played as a replacement for the fast bowler Munaf Patel . Over there he played for his national side in the second test where he bowled three overs including one maiden and conceded only five runs without taking a wicket. [12] Later on, he was called for the tour of England in July–August 2007.
Sharma got a call back in the team in the 3rd Test during Pakistan's tour of India in December 2007 due to injury of India's frontline pacers Zaheer Khan , RP Singh , and Sreesanth . [13] Sharma picked up 5 wickets during the third test in Bangalore . [14] This performance earned him a place in India's squad for the tour of Australia.
Sharma was left out in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne during the Border–Gavaskar Trophy as India retained their main fast bowlers, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh. However, in January 2008 Sharma was called to represent India once again to replace the injured Zaheer Khan in the second test at the SCG . Sharma started the first day of the match strongly and was involved in a controversial decision from Steve Bucknor when Andrew Symonds nicked the ball to keeper MS Dhoni off his bowling but was given not out. He bowled reasonably in the match, however without much luck.
Although he had little success, the management retained him for the third Test match at Perth. On the fourth day of the match he bowled an exceptional spell to Australian captain Ricky Ponting that resulted in his wicket and helped India claim victory. [15] He used the pace and bounce of the WACA wicket to trouble the batsmen. In the following test played in Adelaide he picked up two wickets and impressed everyone with his bowling. He finished the tour of Australia with figures of 6/358, an average of 59.66 and a strike rate of 101.0. [16]
On 10 February 2008, Sharma bagged four important wickets in the 4th ODI of CB Series against Australia. He ended the match with figures of 4/38 and named Man of the Match. [17] He scalped two important wickets on 18 February 2008 versus Australia in the 7th ODI of CB series. [18]
During the 2008 Test series against Australia in India , Ishant was the leading wicket-taker, with 16, and was named man-of-the-series as India won 2–0. He thereby became the first Indian paceman to win such an award in a Test series on Indian soil after Kapil Dev who won the award in 1983. He was noted for achieving reverse swing on balls sometimes as young as eight overs, and along with senior opening bowler Zaheer Khan, troubled the touring Australians. [19] He took Australian captain Ricky Ponting's wicket three times during the series, and six times in as many Tests, making the Indian press label Ponting as Ishant's bunny. [20]
However, in 2009, Ishant's form slumped, and he was dropped for the second Test against Sri Lanka, replaced by Sreesanth .
On 5 October 2010, Ishant helped VVS Laxman pull off a highly unlikely win over Australia by one wicket in the first Test in Mohali after India had fallen to 8/124 in pursuit of 205. Ishant provided Laxman with support during an 81-run partnership in which he contributed 31 valuable runs.
Sharma bowling in the nets in 2008
In the 2011 IPL auction, Sharma was bought by the Deccan Chargers ; he hoped that his performance in the competition would give him a chance to impress selectors and push for selection in India's ODI team. [21] From 12 matches, Sharma took 11 wickets at an average of 28.54. [22] A month after the IPL, which was held in April and May, India toured the West Indies for five ODIs and three Tests . Several senior players were rested from the ODI side and others absent through injury; this mostly affected the batsmen but Zaheer Khan missed the ODI series. [23] India won the first three ODIs, and Sharma was called into the team for the fourth, hisom 20 overs. [15]
Pakistan started off well with openers Kamran Akmal and Shahzaib Hasan adding 48 run for the 1st wicket, before Kamran Akmal was stumped by Kumar Sangakkara by the first delivery of Sanath Jayasuriya . [12] Pakistan reached the target in 18.4 overs, with Shahid Afridi , who hit the winning runs, earning Man of the Match [16] while Tillakaratne Dilshan was declared Man of the Series for his 317 runs at an average of 63.40. Pakistan's win, often cheered on by crowds of fans from England's Pakistani communities, marked its first world title since Imran Khan 's "cornered tigers" had won the 1992 World Cup.

2015[ edit ]
In the 2015 Indian Premier League , Ashish Reddy was retained by the Sunrisers Hyderabad and took Darren Sammy's wicket in the match against RCB. He was also part of a thrilling match against Delhi Daredevils in which he had hit Angelo Mathews for a six scoring 15 runs from 8 balls, where his team finally lost by a mere 4 runs. Ashish hit crucial 22 runs in 8 balls against Kings XI Punjab in which SRH won the match.



Domestic career[ edit ]
Williamson attended Tauranga Boys' College from 2004–2008 where he was Head Boy in his final year and was coached by Josh Syms. Syms described Williamson as having "a thirst to be phenomenal – but not at anyone else's expense." [2]
After a difficult winter tour with the Emerging Players' Squad, Williamson bounced back in fine style for Northern Districts averaging almost five hundred in the domestic one-day tournament, culminating in scoring 69 off 71 balls the final victory over Auckland Aces .
After a promising start to his international career, Williamson was signed up by the Gloucestershire County Cricket Club . [3]
International career[ edit ]
On 24 March 2010 Williamson was named in the New Zealand Test squad for the second Test against Australia, [4] but ultimately he did not play in the match. [5]
Williamson made his One-Day International debut against India on 10 August 2010. He was dismissed for a 9th ball duck . In his second match, he was bowled by Angelo Mathews for a second ball duck. He scored his maiden ODI century against Bangladesh on 14 October 2010 in Dhaka and hence became the youngest centurion in New Zealand cricket history. Due to his performance on the Bangladesh tour where New Zealand suffered a 4–0 whitewash, Williamson was selected in the New Zealand Test squad for the tour of India that followed. [6]
Williamson made his Test cricket debut against India at Ahmedabad on 4 November 2010. In his first innings he scored 131 runs off 299 balls and became the eighth New Zealand player to score a century on Test debut .
Williamson scored test match score of 161 against West Indies in June 2014. It was his second test century of the series and helped secure a rare away test series victory for his side. Williamson finished as the leading overall run scorer in the series with 413 runs, and was only denied a double century by rain which forced skipper Brendon McCullum to declare in the interest of a result in the match. He was also reported for chucking in April 2014, [7] [8] but was cleared in December 2014. [9] [10] His illegal bowling action started after he left high school in order to get a faster release and turn on the ball. His new action essentially reverts him to his action in high school, with a more side-on approach and less wrist and elbow deviation. [11] He was also named as captain ahead of the ODI and Twenty20 series against Pakistan as Brendon McCullum was rested. [12]
Williamson is currently third on the list (behind Corey Anderson and Jesse Ryder) for the highest ever strike-rated century by a New Zealander in a One-Day International . He achieved during his 100* off 69 balls against Zimbabwe at Bulawayo , [13] but a fine innings of 99* by Malcolm Waller ensured that he ended up on the losing side. [14] On September 19, 2014 he scored his first T20 hundred scoring 101* in 49 balls to guide Northern Districts for a comfortable win against Cape Cobras in Champions League Twenty20 2014. [15] He has also established one of the most potent no.3-no.4 top-order partnership with Ross Taylor , with himself being the most prolific no.3 batsman for the national side since former captain Stephen Fleming . Also, Fleming (in 2006) and Williamson (in 2015) became the most recent no.3 batsmen to score double centuries. [16] However, they were also involved in 12 run outs across all forms of international cricket as of 26 January 2015 when they are both on the crease. [17] As a fielder, his position is predominantly at gully, [18] but can move to point with spin bowlers, or cover point with fast bowlers.
In 2015, he started with 69 and 242 not out against Sri Lanka, with two catches in the field in a man-of-the-match performance. [19] On 3 February 2015, he helped New Zealand score the 99th ODI century in the team's history against Pakistan; Ross Taylor scored the 100th in the same match. He also scored over 700 runs before the 2015 Cricket World Cup in just the first two months of the calendar year. On 17 June 2015 he became the fifth-fastest batsmen and fastest New Zealander to score 3,000 runs, getting them in just 78 innings. On November 15, 2015, Williamson and Taylor became the first pair of away batsmen to each score second-innings-centuries at WACA Ground .
Williamson's childhood hero was Sachin Tendulkar . [20] During the New Zealand vs Pakistan 2014 ODI series he donated his entire match fee for all 5 ODIs to the victims of the 2014 Peshawar school massacre . [21] [22]

In September, 2005 Henriques was named in Australia's U-19 squad to tour India for a One Day series against the Indian U-19 cricket team . Whilst Australia lost the series, in difficult conditions, Henriques was a stand out. He scored 132 runs at an average of 44.00 and claimed 8 wickets at 18.25. [4]
Henriques was named captain of the Australian U-19 team for the 2006 U-19 Cricket World Cshown under "Related Changes". Pages you are watching are bolded on the list (this can be helpful for finding which pages in a given category you have on your watchlist).

[19] Making the announcement Mr Rann said that "Adelaide Oval is an icon of this city and this State. Rather than building yet another stadium at massive cost, the South Australian government will contribute significantly to this upgrade". [20] Mr Rann also gave an undertaking that the historic Oval's key heritage features-including the century old scoreboard, Northern mound 'outer', open 'cathedral end' and Moreton Bay Fig trees would be retained in the redevelopment.

2012 - The two grandstands, named the Chappell Stands, after the South Australian cricketing brot first ODI since August 2010. [24] [25] He managed one wicket from two matches in the series while conceding 109 runs. [26] The first Test resulted in a win for India and Sharma took three wickets in each innings. [27] He claimed his 100th Test wicket in the second Test, becoming the fifth youngest to reach the landmark; the fixture was also the first time he took ten wickets in a match for India. [28] [29] The second and third Tests ended in draws and India won the series 1–0; [30] Sharma was the leading wicket-taker on either side with 22 dismissals at an average of 16.86. [31]
After the tour of West Indies, India suffer a run of eight consecutive defeats in away Tests. In July and August the team played four Tests in England . England inflicted a 4–0 whitewash on India, [32] and in the process replaced India as No. 1 ranked Test team. [33] Playing in all four matches, Sharma managed 11 wickets at an average pushing 60. [34] During the series Sharma suffered an anckle injury and missed the ODI leg, but was sufficiently reovered to face the West Indies in November when India hosted them for three Tests. [35] While India won 2–0, Sharma managed five wickets from three matches at a cost of in excess of 65 runs each. [36] Sharma played in all four Tests of India's tour of Australia in 2011–12 . India lost the series 4–0, while Sharma took five wickets at the cost of 451 runs. [37]
In March 2012, Sharma underwent surgery on his ankle which had been troubling him for over a year. The operation meant that he missed the 2012 IPL. [38]
In 2013 Ind vs Aus ODI series, he gave away 30 runs in an over, equalling the most expensive over by an Indian bowler. (Yuvraj Singh had conceded 30 runs against England in an ODI match in 2007) [39]
After some bad performances against Australia in 2013 ODI series, he came back strongly against South Africa taking 4/40 in the third ODI on 11 December 2013 at SuperSport Park , which was his 2nd best performance in ODIs. [40]
In the 2014 tour of England , Sharma secured his career best figures of 7/74 at the Lord's , with an aggressive spell in England's second innings, bowling India to a 95-run win. [41] During the first test of the series, Sharma suffered the slight ignominy of becoming Alastair Cook 's sole Test wicket when caught down the leg side. [42] India finished the series losing 3–1. He finished the 2015 three-match Test series in Sri Lanka with 13 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul in the third Test at SSC . At the end of the match, he was handed a one match ban by the International Cricket Council (ICC), following an altercation with Dhammika Prasad in the course of the match. [43] The series also saw him pick his 200th wicket in Tests. [44] India won the series 2–1.
Bowling style
A right arm fast-medium bowler, the speed of Sharma's bowling has diminished since he emerged on the international scene, [45] although in 2008 he bowled a delivery at over 152 kilometres per hour (94 mph). [46] Such occurrences were not the norm as his pace dropped to around 130 km/h (81 mph), but under Eric Simons (who was India's bowling coach from 2010 to 2012) Sharma was regularly bowling in excess of 140 km/h (87 mph) when India toured Australia in 2011/12. [47] [48] According to India's former bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad he is amongst the most dedicated bowler in India's set up. [49]
Simons noted height was a factor in the length Sharma bowled, saying "For Ishant to hit the stumps, he has to pitch it fuller, and that means the batsman has more chance of keeping it out". [48] Former West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh identified two problems with Sharma's bowling action : his head drops when the ball is delivered and the position of his wrist varies. The first takes some of the speed out of the delivery, while the second reduces the chance of the ball seaming and swinging . The former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar suggested that the lack of movement in Sharma's bowling discouraged him from pitching the ball up so instead he tends to bowl short . The slower pace of his bowling when he pitches the ball up may explain why the yorker is not an effective delivery for him. Manjrekar went further, saying that "for all his talent and commitment he just does not take enough wickets"; when the remark was made in January 2012, Sharma had a bowling average of nearly 37 from 43 Tests. [50]

Cricket[ edit ]
In 1854 the Garrison Club defeated the Royal Victoria Club in the first recorded cricket match to be played at what was then the Garrison Ground. Although major games were played at the Domain , the Garrison Ground was used for practice by the NSW cricket team in 1860 and by the Victorian team in 1861 the before inter-colonial matches in those years.
Cricket was first played in Australia in Sydney's Hyde Park in 1803. However, up until the appointment of trustees to look after the SCG in the late 1870s, several different grounds had been used for major matches. The Domain was first used for inter-colonial games and then the Albert Ground in Redfern but in time both became unavailable, the Domain because of its poor condition and because it could not be fenced in and the Albert Ground because it closed in the late 1870s.
After the closure of the Albert Ground the New South Wales Cricket Association began using the Association Ground. The first major game played there was the final of the Civil Service Challenge Cup on 25 October 1877, between the New South Wales Government Printing Office and the Audit Office. The first first-class match was the inter-colonial game between New South Wales and Victoria played on 22, 23 and 25 February 1878 where New South Wales won by 1 wicket. [16]
Main article: Sydney Riot of 1879
During the 1878–79 season Lord Harris ' England team toured Australia. The feature of the tourists game against New South Wales at the SCG in 1879 was a riot sparked apparently when the crowd disagreed with an umpiring decision by George Coulthard that went against the locals. Lord Harris believed the invasion of the ground by about 2000 spectators was actually started by bookmakers in the stand. One of the umpires for the match was Edmund Barton , later to become Australia's first Prime Minister.
By the time the first test was played at the SCG between 17 February and 21 February 1882 the ground was in fine condition. The NSWCA had appointed Ned Gregory as curator and given him a cottage next to the ground for him and his family. Australia won that game by overhauling England's scores of 133 and 232 with scores of 197 and 5 for 169.
The ground high score in Test cricket was held for more than a century by Englishman Reg "Tip" Foster , who scored 287 in an Australia-England match in 1903. In the 100th test to be played at the SCG in January 2012, Michael Clarke was joined first by Ricky Ponting in a partnership of 288 and then by Michael Hussey in a partnership of 334 and built a score of 329 not out against India. [17]
Don Bradman made his first visit to the ground in the 1920–21 season to watch the Fifth Test of the Australia and England series. In that game Charlie Macartney scored 170 to help seal a win for Australia.
Bradman scored the highest ever first-class innings of 452 at the SCG for New South Wales against Queensland in 1928–29. This record was surpassed by Hanif Mohammad who scored 499 run out. It was further bettered by the West Indian Brian Lara who scored 501 in 1994.
The 1928–29 season was a big one for cricket. On 15 December, the largest ever crowd to attend a cricket match at the SCG, 58,446, saw Australia and England play. With changes to the ground seating the record is unlikely to be beaten.
In the last test of the 1970–71 English tour, England fast bowler John Snow struck Australian spinner and tailender Terry Jenner on the head with a bouncer . The Sydney crowd let Snow and the English know they were not happy with his behaviour and when Snow took up his fielding position on the fence a spectator spoke to him and grabbed him by the shirt. Cans were thrown onto the field and England captain Ray Illingworth took his team from the ground.

The first women's club cricket match was held at the SCG in 1886 when the Fernleas played the Siroccos. Although cricket was not seen as an appropriate game for women, women's cricket associations were formed in Victoria in 1905 and other states in the 1920s and 1930s.
Night cricket came to the SCG in 1978 with the first World Series Cricket match to be played at the SCG on 28 November that year. A crowd of 50,000 packed the ground.
The SCG was the scene of Shane Warne 's first (1992) and final tests (2007).
The SCG was the scene of tragedy on 25 November 2014, when a bouncer from Sean Abbott struck Phillip Hughes 's neck, knocking him unconscious. Hughes later died as a result of a subarachnoid haemorrhage on 27 November, having never regained consciousness. [18]
Rugby league football[ edit ]
The SCG has hosted over 1,100 top-level premiership rugby league games – more than any other ground. Between 1913 and 1987, the NSWRFL Premiership Final was always played at the SCG, unless circumstances dictated otherwise. Due to the ground's historical significance to rugby league, it is often used for special heritage matches for National Rugby League club and representative matches.
Rugby league football was first played at the SCG on 22 June 1911 between Australia and New Zealand . [19] The ground was first used by the New South Wales Rugby Football League in 1913. At this time the Trust only gave players access to dressing sheds in the Sheridan Stand and did not allow use of the rooms in the Member's Stand. This rule was relaxed in 1918. The 1915 NSWRFL season 's first round match between defending premiers Eastern Suburbs and Glebe was played in front of a record crowd of 13,000. [20]
The 1920 Great Britain Lions tour saw the British rugby league team tour Australia for the first time since World War I and huge crowds attended their games. The first match of the tour was at the SCG against Metropolis in front of nearly 68,000 spectators. Australia won the first Test in Brisbane and in the second Test at the SCG on 3 July. The Australians sealed the series, scoring five tries to win 21–8 and secure the Ashes series for the first time at home.
The attendance record for a rugby league match in Australia was broken in 1932 when 70,204 people saw Australia play England in the first test of the 1932 Ashes series at the Cricket Ground. [21] It was also in this game that the Australians first wore the green jersey with a double gold ‘V', which they have been wearing ever since. The English side boasted one of the great rugby league back lines consisting of captain Jim Sullivan (fullback), Alf Ellaby and Stan Smith (wings), and Artie Atkinson and Stan Brogden in the centres. The gates of the SCG had to be closed to prevent another 15,000 people from entering. Australia lost the game 8–6. The second game was the famous ‘Battle of Brisbane' Test, which Australia won. In the third Test back at the SCG Australia lead 11–3 until late in the game. Incredibly, England scored three quick tries to snatch the game (18–13) and the series. The attendance of the first test stood as the highest recorded crowd for an international rugby league match until 73,631 fans attended the 1992 World Cup Final between Australia and Great Britain at the famous Wembley Stadium in London, England.
Unrecognizable after playing on a muddy SCG, footballers of the British and Australian national rugby league sides leave the field after the first Test on 12 June 1950.
The next tour by England was in 1946, knows as The "Indomitables" tour. The first test played on 17 June was an 8 – 8 draw, the opening try of the series was scored by the legendary Frank Whitcombe for the tourists, in front of a crowd of 64,527. England went on to win The Ashes. In 1950 Australia had not won a series against the team Lions for 30 years but this time there was a big change. Britain had won the first Test and Australia the second, which made the third SCG Test the decider. Unfortunately, the tour coincided with a record amount of rain and by the time the teams arrived the SCG was a mud heap. Forty tonnes of soil were brought in and spread over the surface to try and dry it out. Tied 2–2 at half time, Australia scored the only try of the match late in the second half when winger Ron Roberts crossed in the corner to seal the win. At the end of the game the crowd of over 47,000 jumped the fence and invaded the field and congregated in front of the Members Stand cheering and calling for Aussie captain Clive Churchill .
The 1963 rugby league Grand Final was won by the St. George Dragons 8–3 in front of 69,860 fans in atrocious conditions. It was the Dragons eighth consecutive premiership and their third consecutive Grand Final win against the Western Suburbs Magpies . The match's only try, scored by Dragons winger Johnny King , was clouded in controversy after he appeared to be tackled when a defender knocked him flat on the ground, only to get up and carry the ball to the try line under howls of protest from Wests players who believe that the referee had called King to play the ball. That try became the centre of furore when rumors spread that match referee Darcy Lawler had bet on St. George to win (Wests captain Arthur Summons later claimed one of his players announced to his team mates before the game that any who had bet on the Magpies to win had better lay off their bets as referee Lawler had backed St. George). After the match, photographer John O'Gready took the iconic rugby league photograph, "The Gladiators", depicting Arthur Summons supporting St. George captain Norm Provan . The photo of Summons and Provan was later used as the basis for the Winfield Cup trophy, and continues to be used to this day with the National Rugby League 's Telstra Premiership Trophy.
On 18 September 1965, the largest ever official crowd at the SCG, 78,056, saw St George defeat the South Sydney Rabbitohs 12–8 in the NSWRFL Grand Final . Gates were ordered to be closed two hours before the game began and children were allowed to sit inside the fence. Contemporary accounts indicate that many more – perhaps thousands – gained other means of access and sat on grandstand roofs or went into the Sydney Showground (Moore Park) and viewed the match from the stairways and roof of the main pavilion. Estimates from people there that day put the crowd as high as 90,000. This would stand as the largest rugby league crowd in Australia until Game 2 of the 1994 State of Origin series when 87,161 attended the game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Due to the overcrowding of the ground during the Grand Final, the New South Wales Police Force imposed a 70,000 capacity limit on the Cricket Ground for safety reasons.
The SCG hosted the 1968 Rugby League World Cup Final , won 20–2 by the Johnny Raper led Australians over France in front of 54,290. The Australian team that day, coached by Harry Bath , boasted legends of the Australian game in Raper (Lock), Eric Simms (Fullback), Graeme Langlands and Johnny Greaves (centres), Bob Fulton (Five-eight), Billy Smith (halfback), Arthur Beetson (prop) and Dick Thornett and Ron Coote (second-row).
One of the most courageous efforts at the SCG was John Sattler 's performance in the 1970 grand final between South Sydney and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles . In the first ten minutes of the game, South's captain Sattler had his jaw broken by a punch from Manly forward John Bucknall in an off-the-ball incident. Sattler went down but pulled himself up on team mate Michael Cleary , asking the winger to help him so that the other players would not know he was hurt. In an act of supreme courage Sattler played on, refusing treatment at half time and pleas from team mates not to take the field again, to lead Souths to a famous 23–12 win. It was not until well after the game that he went to hospital. The Australian side to tour Britain was selected that night and, but for his injury, Sattler would have been picked as captain.
The Cricket Ground hosted what many consider to be the toughest Grand Final of all in 1973 when defending premiers Manly-Warringah faced the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks , who were playing in their first ever Grand Final after joining the competition in 1967 . The Sharks were Captain-coached by Great Britain halfback Tommy Bishop and had a forward pack led by his tough St Helens and GB team mate Cliff Watson and 1973 Rothmans Medallist Ken Maddison , along with goal kicking 18-year-old whiz-kid centre Steve Rogers . Manly were coached by Ron Willey and captained by tough hooker Freddy Jones , and could boast internationals Ken Irvine , Ray Branighan , Bob Fulton, John O'Neill , British lock Malcolm Reilly , as well as tough tackling second-row forward Terry Randall and 19-year-old fullkack Graham Eadie . From the opening kick off the game descended into a series of high or late tackles and several all-in brawls, though surprisingly referee Keith Page didn't send any player off, despite threatening to do so and repeatedly handing out cautions, including twice to all 26 players on the field. In the opening minute of the game, Mal Reilly was felled in back play by a Cronulla forward well after he kicked the ball and, after writhing on the ground in agony with a badly bruised hip, left the field for a pain killing injection. When he returned he created mayhem with strong-arm tactics, although he was clearly out of sorts football wise and was replaced after just 25 minutes by John Bucknell. In the end, the difference between the two teams was Manly's international centre Bob Fulton who scored two tries in leading Manly to a 10–7 win. The game was described by Sunday Telegraph writer Ian Heads as "A Grand Final as tough and dirty as any bar-room brawl". [22]
In 1975, in one of the most memorable grand finals ever, the Arthur Beetson captained, Jack Gibson coached Eastern Suburbs Roosters , defeated St. George 38–0 to win the premiership. That Roosters team is considered one of the best sides ever assembled and the eight tries to nil scoreline remained a record winning margin in a grand final until the 2008 NRL Grand Final played between Manly Warringah and the Melbourne Storm , Manly winning by the tune of 40–0. However, the game was famous for reasons other than the scoreline. St George's Captain-coach Graeme Langlands played with a misdirected pain killing injection that made his right leg go numb and prevented him from playing anywhere near his best. Easts were without two of their stars, rookie fullback Russell Fairfax and centre Mark Harris , and coach Jack Gibson gambled on an unknown player to help fill the void – John Rheinberger – who played in his first only first grade game in the Grand Final. Leading by only 5–0 at half-time, the Roosters scored an avalanche of tries after the interval to humiliate the Dragons. Earlier in the same season, the Roosters recorded the longest winning streak of any first grade rugby league football club – 19 matches. It was the Eastern Suburbs Roosters' eleventh premiership victory and their second in succession.
In 1981 , another memorable and emotional rugby league grand final was played at the SCG. Since joining the Sydney Premiership in 1947 , the Parramatta Eels had not won a grand final. In 1976 and 1977 it had suffered consecutive losses, first to Manly-Warringah (who also joined the league in 1947) and then St George in the first replayed grand final. In 1981, the Eels 'dream team' (another team coached by Jack Gibson), comprising internationals Ray Price , Mick Cronin , Ron Hilditch and Bob "The Bear" O'Reilly , as well as budding stars Peter Sterling , Brett Kenny , Steve Ella , Eric Grothe and John Muggleton , outscored the Tommy Raudonikis captained Newtown four tries to three to win 20–11 and secure their first premiership. Playing second-row for Newtown that day was future dual Grand Final winning, and NSW State of Origin coach Phil Gould . Financial pressures at the Newtown club would result in the Jets competing in the New South Wales Rugby League first grade competition for only two seasons following their 1981 grand final appearance.
The 1986 NSWRL Grand Final at the SCG between the John Monie coached Parramatta and defending premiers Canterbury-Bankstown , coached by Warren Ryan , and played in front of one of the smallest Grand Final crowds in years (45,843), would go down as the lowest scoring and only try-less Grand Final in NSWRL history. Parramatta won their 4th premiership in six years with a tough 4–2 win thanks to two Mick Cronin goals to send captain Ray Price, and Cronin, into rugby league retirement on the winning note they deserved after stellar careers for Parramatta, NSW and Australia. Cronin retired from the game having scored 1,971 points in the Sydney premiership (75 tries, 865 goals and 2 field goals, all for Parramatta), at the time the record number of points scored in a career.
The last ever rugby league Grand Final played at the Cricket Ground was the 1987 decider between the Bob Fulton coached Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and the Canberra Raiders , who had joined the premiership in 1982 . In front of 50,201 fans on an unseasonably warm day in Sydney, the Sea Eagles ran out 18–8 winners, scoring two tries to one with dual rugby international Michael O'Connor scoring 14 of Manly's points with a try and a perfect 5/5 goal kicking. Manly Five-eighth Cliff Lyons won the Clive Churchill Medal as the man of the match.
The ground lost the Grand Final and numerous games to the Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) in 1988 . Even so, the ground continues to host occasional National Rugby League matches. [23] [24] and the 2008 Centenary ANZAC Test between Australia and New Zealand, in what was the first test held at the famous old ground since the Wally Lewis captained Australians had defeated the Kiwis 29–12 on 19 July 1986. The 2008 Kangaroos, kitted out in replica 1908 jumpers depicting the colours of NSW and Qld, ran out 28-12 winners in front of 34,571 fans, the largest Test crowd in Sydney since the first Ashes test of the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour when 40,141 attended Game 1 at the SFS.
Tennis[ edit ]
In 1885 the first inter-colonial tennis match was held at the SCG when Victoria played New South Wales although forms of the game were no doubt played in Australia from its colonial beginnings. All colonies of Australia were well established when the final versions of the rules of the game were codified by the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1875 and by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 1877 when it held its first tournament at Wimbledon .
Tennis was regularly played at the SCG in the early days. The Sydney tournament which was to become the New South Wales Open, was first played at the SCG in 1885 before moving to the NSW Lawn Tennis Club's courts at Double Bay, then to White City and later to the Olympic Tennis Centre at Homebush Bay .
Motor Racing[ edit ]
In 1898, Sydney cycle firm, Gavin Gibson Ltd, imported seven motorised tricycles produced by Count Jules-Albert de Dion and powered by one cylinder petrol engines designed by his partner Georges Bouton . On the evening of 1 January 1901, these seven machines raced around the concrete cycle track which ringed the inside of the SCG in those days to compete in Australia's first ever motor race.
Empire Games[ edit ]
The SCG was the main stadium for the 1938 British Empire Games which were tied into the State's sesqi-centenary celebrations. Perhaps because of this the Federal Government provided no money and only £10,000 came from the State Government to cover the organising committee's administrative costs. The budget was therefore, very tight and using the existing SCG was one way of making ends meet. Cyclist Edgar "Dunc" Gray led the teams onto the ground and athletes ran on a makeshift grass track.
Rugby Union[ edit ]
Club rugby was first played at the then Civil and Military Ground as early as 1870, and the first inter-colonial game was played there in 1882. NSW beat Queensland 28–4. From June 1911 the NSW Rugby League had exclusive use of the SCG, as well as the Sydney Sports Ground and the Sydney Showground , preventing rugby union games from being played there. Over the years the SCG hosted 71 rugby union tests before Sydney international matches were moved first to Waratah Rugby Park ( Concord Oval ), then the Sydney Football Stadium and later Stadium Australia . The largest ever crowd to watch a rugby union match at the SCG was 49,327 who saw NSW played New Zealand on 13 July 1907.
Of those 71 tests none could have been more dramatic than the game against the South African Springboks on 7 August 1971. Marred by anti- apartheid protests, field invasions and objects being thrown onto the ground and halted several times to removed golf balls and protestors it was won by South Africa who went through the tour undefeated.
The SCG has been both a happy and unhappy hunting ground for Australian rugby union. One of the worst incidents to occur there was the sad demise of Ken Catchpole's international career. Robbed of a glorious retirement, his career ended in a disgraceful scandal. Australia was playing the New Zealand All Blacks and while Catchpole was trapped on the bottom of a ruck New Zealander second rower, Colin Meads, tried to drag him out by one leg, splitting him like a wishbone. Australia, although well beaten on this occasion, was well served by international-standard halfbacks and 20-year-old John Hipwell ran on for his first test as Catchpole was carried off. It was a sad end to an illustrious career.
Dramatic though that game was, no test could have been as important in the development of Australian Rugby Union than the game against the touring Welsh team in 1978.
The 1978 Welsh had arrived in Australia as (the then) Five Nations Champions, Triple Crown winners, the best rugby union team in the world but they were a sad and sorry bunch by the time they got to Sydney for the last game of the tour, the second test. The team was decimated by injuries and in two earlier tour games had suffered a last minute loss to Sydney and a humiliating defeat midweek to the Australian Capital Territory .
Rumours abounded that the Welsh were ready for a big 'get square' with Australian prop Steve Finnane, the so-called 'enforcer' of the Australian team. Finnane and other senior members of the team had vowed to avenge the defeat of the Australians by the Welsh on their last tour of the UK several years before. The SCG crowd didn't have long to wait because after the very first scrum Welsh prop Graham Price came out holding his bloodied jaw, the victim of a Finnane punch. Price had bored in on Finnane, his opposite number in the front row and Finnane reacted.
After Price left the field and the game continued for a short while until the Welsh, using a pre-determined code word, sparked an all-in-brawl. Wales lost the test and the two-test series.
In 1979 there was a one-off game against the All Blacks at the SCG. The kicking of a young five-eighth named Tony Melrose closed out the New Zealanders and Australia won a try-less game 12–6, to take back the Bledisloe Cup for the first time since 1949. The following year the Australians showed it was no fluke by beating New Zealand two tests to one in Australia to successfully defend the trophy for the first time.
Australian rules football[ edit ]

The first Australian rules football match to be played at the SCG was Inter-Colonial football match played between Victoria and New South Wales on 6 August 1881.
Essendon and Melbourne played a premiership match at Moore Park in 1904 in front of the Governor General and Governor of NSW. Melbourne won and both teams had to return home by boat down the coast; two other matches (Fitzroy v Collingwood and Geelong v Carlton, which had been postponed) were also played there in 1903.
In the subsequent decades, the ground was rarely used for Australian Rules, except for the occasional exhibition match or interstate football carnival.
Richmond played Collingwood there in 1952, and eight VFL matches were played there in 1979–1981, but Australian rules football was not to make a regular comeback to the SCG until 1982, when South Melbourne relocated to Sydney and made the SCG its home ground.

Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji Jadeja was an Indian who played for the English cricket team
The British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721. [4] In 1848, the Parsi community in Bombay formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians. After slow beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877. [5] By 1912, the Parsis, Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans every year. [5] In the early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for the England cricket team . Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and KS Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy – two major first-class tournaments in India. In 1911, an Indian team went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team. [6]
India was invited into The Imperial Cricket Council in 1926, and made their debut as a Test playing nation in England in 1932 , led by CK Nayudu , who was considered as the best Indian batsman at the time. [7] The one-off Test match between the two sides was played at Lord's in London . The team was not strong in their batting at this point and went on to lose by 158 runs. [8] In 1933, the first Test series in India was played between India and England with matches in Bombay, Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Madras (now Chennai). England won the series 2-0. [9] The Indian team continued to improve throughout the 1930s and '40s but did not achieve an international victory during this period. In the early 1940s, India didn't play any Test cricket due to the Second World War . The team's first series as an independent country was in late 1947 against Sir Donald Bradman 's Invincibles (a name given to the Australia national cricket team of that time). It was also the first Test series India played which was not against England. Australia won the five-match series 4–0, with Bradman tormenting the Indian bowling in his final Australian summer. [10] India subsequently played their first Test series at home not against England against the West Indies in 1948. West Indies won the 5-Test series 1-0. [11]
India recorded their first Test victory, in their 24th match, against England at Madras (now Chennai) in 1952. [12] Later in the same year, they won their first Test series, which was against Pakistan . [13] They continued their improvement throughout the early 1950s with a series win against New Zealand in 1956. However, they did not win again in the remainder of the decade and lost badly to strong Australian and English sides. The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home. They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961–62, and also won a home series against New Zealand . They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia, and another series against England. In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967–68.

The key to India's bowling in the 1970s were the Indian spin quartet – Bishen Bedi , E.A.S. Prasanna , BS Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan . This period also saw the emergence of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath . Indian pitches have had tendency to support spin and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups. These players were responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of Ajit Wadekar . Gavaskar scored 774 runs in the West Indian series while Dilip Sardesai 's 112 played a big part in their one Test win.

The advent of One Day International cricket in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world. However, India was not considerably strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defence-based approaches to batting. India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup. Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975, India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.
In contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and were particularly strong at home where their combination of stylish batsman and beguiling spinners were seen at their best. India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976 when they chased 403 to win thanks to 112 from Viswanath. This West Indian defeat is considered to be a watershed in the history of their cricket because it led to captain Clive Lloyd dispensing with spin altogether and relying entirely on a four-man pace attack. In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without an individual scoring a century. There were six fifties, the highest being 70 by Mohinder Amarnath . The innings was the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures.
During the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy Mohammed Azharuddin , Dilip Vengsarkar and all-rounder Ravi Shastri . India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and two-time defending champions West Indies in the final, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the Asia Cup and in 1985, won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the Indian subcontinent . India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the subcontinent for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India's best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers. Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark. Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets. The period was also marked by an unstable leadership, with Gavaskar and Kapil exchanging the captaincy several times.
With 619 wickets, Anil Kumble is the world's third highest wicket taker in Tests and India's highest Test and ODI wicket taker . [14]
The addition of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, Javagal Srinath , India's fastest bowler since Amar Singh made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the subcontinent while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the 1996 Cricket World Cup semifinal, the team underwent a year of change as Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid , later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's . Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998. With the captaincy burden removed, Tendulkar was the world's leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs, as India enjoyed a home Test series win over Australia, the best ranked team in the world. After failing to reach the semifinals at the 1999 Cricket World Cup , Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3–0 on a tour of Australia and then 2–0 at home to South Africa. Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again. Ganguly was appointed the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman Ajay Jadeja were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as "the Indian cricket's worst hour". However, the new core – Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly – swore not to let this happen to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times. And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era. [15]
Since 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements with the appointment of John Wright as India's first ever foreign coach . India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001. The series was famous for the Kolkata Test match, in which India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. Australian captain Steve Waugh labelled India as the "Final Frontier" as a result of his side's inability to win a Test series in India. [16] Victory in 2001 against the Australians marked the beginning of a dream run for India under their captain Ganguly, winning Test matches in Zimbabwe , Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. The England series is also known for India's highest ODI run-chase of 325 runs at Lord's which came in the Natwest ODI Series final against England. In the same year, India were joint-winners of the ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka, and then went to the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa where they reached the final only to be beaten by Australia . The 2003–04 season also saw India play out a Test series in Australia where they drew 1–1 with the world champions, and then win a Test and ODI series in Pakistan.

At the end of the 2004 season, India suffered from lack of form and fitness from its older players. A defeat in a following home Test series against Australia was followed by an ODI home series defeat against Pakistan followed by a Test series levelled 1–1. Greg Chappell took over from John Wright as the coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and his methods proved to be controversial during the beginning of his tenure. The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly, resulting in Rahul Dravid being made captain. This triggered a revival in the team's fortunes, following the emergence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina , and the coming of age of players like Irfan Pathan and Yuvraj Singh . A thumping home series victory over Sri Lanka in 2005 and a drawn series with South Africa put India at second place in the ICC ODI rankings. Dravid, Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were selected to play for the ICC World XI in the 2005 " SuperTest " against Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second. [17] Towards the middle of 2006, however, a 4–1 series loss in the West Indies gave rise to a slump in India's ODI form, while they achieved a 1–0 victory in the Test series that followed, giving them their first Test series victory in the Caribbean since 1971. India's ODI form slumped further with a disappointing performance in the 2006 Champions Trophy and a drubbing in the ODI series in South Africa. This was followed yet again by an initial good performance in the Tests, giving India its first Test match win in South Africa, although they went on to loshers Ian Chappell , Greg Chappell and Trevor Chappell along with the The Sir Donald Bradman were demolished.

Oval layout[ edit ]
The oval dimensions were originally 190m x 125m, [27] both unusually long and unusually narrow for an Australian cricket/football ground. The arrangement was highly favourable for batsmen who played square of the wicket, and heavily penalised bowlers who delivered the ball short or wide so that the batsman could play cut , hook or pull shots. Before the far ends in front of and behind the wicket were roped off, making the playing area shorter, it was not uncommon for batsmen to hit an all-run four or even occasionally a five. [28]
Historically, the Adelaide Oval's integral pitch was generally very good for batting, and offering little assistance to bowlers until the last day of a match. Since the redevelopment in 2013, a drop-in pitch has been used at the venue. [29]
The playing area is surrounded by a white picket fence and advertising billboards.
The Hill was created in 1898 with earth from the banks of the River Torrens .
The scoreboard was first used in 1911 and still shows its original Edwardian architecture.
The scoreboard is listed on the City of Adelaide Heritage Register, helping to maintain the charm of the ground.
With the 2011-2014 redevelopment completed, the oval dimensions changed to 183m x 134m, making it more suitable for Australian Rules Football, for which the playing field dimensions will be 167m x 124m.

Western stand redevelopment[ edit ]
In August 2008 the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) announced that it had approved plans to redevelop the ground, involving expanding its capacity to 40,000. Development plans showed a reconfiguration of the playing surface and a remodelled western stand. The redevelopment would make the ground a viable option for hosting Australian Football League games as well as international soccer and rugby. The state and federal Governments each pledged $25m to the project, leaving the SACA to raise at least $45m. The SACA planned for the new stand to be ready in time for the 2010–11 Ashes series. [30] The Western grandstands were torn down in June 2009 [31] and a single Western stand was developed in its place ahead of the 2010-11 Ashes series . [32] The new Western stand incorporates 14,000 individual seats and features improved shading conditions and amenities for SACA members. [33]
2010 state election proposals[ edit ]
In the lead up to the 2010 South Australian state election , the opposition Liberal Party announced that, if elected, it would build with a new stadium with a roof, located at Riverside West at the site of the state government's new hospital location. [34] [35] The incumbent Labor Party subsequently announced it would fund a $450 million upgrade and redevelopment of the whole of Adelaide Oval, rather than just the Western Grand Stand. [36] Labor narrowly won re-election at the 2010 state election , resulting in its Adelaide Oval upgrade policy going ahead though eventually for a steeper $535 million, of which this deal included the State Government clearing the SACA's (South Australian Cricket Association) $85 million debt..
SACA and SANFL joint redevelopment[ edit ]
The Adelaide Oval Stadium Management Authority (AOSMA), a joint venture of SACA and the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), was registered as a company on 23 December 2009 following the re-announcement of the plan. [37] The AOSMA has eight directors, four associated with SACA ( Ian McLachlan -Chair, John Harnden, Creagh O’Connor & John Bannon ) and four with SANFL (Leigh Whicker-CEO, Rod Payze, Philip Gallagher & Jamie Coppins). [38]
However, in early-mid-2010, prior to the election, it became clear that $450m would be inadequate. Following the 2010 state election , SA Premier Mike Rann capped the State Government's commitment, saying: "It's $450 million – and not a penny more", and set a deadline for the parties to agree. [39] In May, Treasurer Kevin Foley announced that "the Government's final offer to the SANFL and SACA for the redevelopment" was $535 million, and the deadline was extended to August 2010. [40] Simultaneously, the SACA and the SANFL were in the process of negotiating an agreement that would enable Australian Rules Football (AFL) to use Adelaide Oval during the AFL season as their home ground. [41] [42] [43] [44] In August 2010, SANFL and SACA representatives signed letters of intent committing to the project, including the capped $535 million offer from the state government. [45]
The redevelopment included a $40 million pedestrian bridge across the River Torrens to link the Adelaide railway station precinct with the Adelaide Oval precinct, which was partially completed for the Ashes cricket series in December 2013 and fully completed ahead of the 2014 AFL season . [46] [47]
In early 2011, the AFL, SANFL, SACA, the SA Government and the Australian Government reached an agreement to upgrade Adelaide Oval. The SACA and the SANFL proposed, if SACA members vote yes on the upgrade in early May, that the whole Stadium will undergo redevelopment, except for the Northern Mound, the Moreton Bay Fig trees and the scoreboard, which will stay as it is because of it being under heritage listing. A two-thirds majority of SACA members were required to vote in favour of the proposed upgrade for it to ahead, with a successful vote resulting in the SANFL and AFL having control over the stadium for 7 months of the year and SACA having control for 5 months of the year.
SACA members had the choice of voting online on 28 April 2011 or attending in person an Extraordinary Meeting at the Adelaide Showgrounds on 2 May 2011. At 6pm, 28 April 2011, It was announced that 60% of SACA members that voted online voted yes, 15% short of the Majority vote needed for the upgrade to go ahead. At 10.15pm, on 2 May 2011, at the Adelaide Showgrounds, the final result was announced. 80.37% of total votes cast were in favour of Adelaide Oval being redeveloped, resulting in the upgrade and stadium reconfiguration being approved. [48] The upgrade commenced in April 2012, and was finished in time for the 2014 AFL season. [1]
All stands of the Oval were redeveloped and upgraded except for the already rebuilt Western grandstand (SACA and SANFL members only stand), the Northern Mound, the Historic Scoreboard and the Moreton Bay fig trees. The Northern Mound, the Moreton Bay fig trees and the Scoreboard are all heritage listed and will likely never be demolished unless damaged beyond repair. [49]

Domestic career[ edit ]
On 2 January 2006, Henriques made his List A debut for New South Wales against Victoria. He bowled 8 overs for 46 runs in a narrow New South Wales victory. His appearance, at only 18 years of age, made him the youngest ever List A debutant for New South Wales. Six days later, Henriques made his Twenty20 debut, but did not bat or bowl in that match.
He made his first-class debut against South Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 17 October 2006. Only a week after this match, Henriques took 5/17 against Queensland with fast bowling. In doing so, he became the youngest New South Wales cricketer to take 5 wickets in a first-class innings since Doug Walters . However, due to injury, this was the last first-class game Henriques played for over a year. After regaining fitness and impressive performances for his club, St George, in Sydney Grade Cricket , he earned a place in the squad once again.
He was signed by the Kolkata Knight Riders franchise for $300,000 to play in the Indian Premier League during the 2009 season . [7] In 2010, he was traded to the Delhi Daredevils in exchange for Manoj Tiwary .
In 2012 he played part of the English season for Glamorgan.
In September 2012 he scored his first first-class century, 161 not out off 229 balls against Tasmania at Bankstown.
Since then, he has produced some very consistent performances with both bat and ball, a highlight recently in the Matador One Day Cup where he scored 131 against Victoria which was his first List A century. He is the captain of NSW. He is injured but will return towards the end of November.
In June 2015, whilst playing for Surrey in a NatWest t20 Blast game against Sussex Sharks at Arundel Castle , Henriques collided with teammate Rory Burns whilst attempting to take a catch. Both players were knocked unconscious from the collision and Henriques suffered a broken jaw. Ambulances and medical staff treated the players on-field before taking them both to hospital. The game was abandoned due to the injures. [8]
International career[ edit ]
Henriques made his full international debut in a Twenty20 International against New Zealand in Sydney on 15 February 2009, but he was run out for only 1 run. In October, Henriques was called up, after injuries to Brett Lee and James Hopes , during Australia's tour of India. [9] James Hopes had injured his hamstring. Ironically, soon after Henriques played in Hopes' place, he too injured his hamstring. [10] He used to play for Mumbai Indians in the IPL 4, but was ruled out of the squad because of adductor muscle injury. He was released from his contract with the Mumbai Indians team for IPL and was later picked up by Royal Challengers Bangalore in the player auction 2013 for the IPL-6. In 2013, Henriques was selected in Australia's Test cricket team during the tour of India making his test debut and then scored his maiden half- century with 68 runs in the 1st innings of the 1st test backing it up with 81 not out in the 2nd innings.
Personal life[ edit ]
Moisés Henriques field at Endeavour High School in Sydney .
The son of former Portuguese professional footballer, Álvaro, Henriques was born in Funchal , Portugal before moving to Australia with his family at the age of one. [11] He graduated from Endeavour Sports High in 2004, yet while attending high school he represented New South Wales and Australia at Under 17 and Under 19 level. [12] In 2004 he was the recipient of the first Rexona Australian Youth Cricket Scholarship, an initiative backed by Ricky Ponting . [13]
Playing style[ edit ]
A genuine all-rounder, Henriques states that he "couldn't choose" between batting and bowling as his preferred art. [14] Despite this, some have commented that his bowling is slightly better than his batting. [15] As a right-handed batsman, Henriques bats in the middle to lower order, and as a right-arm medium-fast bowler he generally opens the attack. His style has been compared to Australian Shane Watson , but Henriques looks to South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis as a source of inspiration. [14]

Personal life
Sreesanth was born on February 6, 1983 to Santhakumaran Nair and Savithri Devi. He has one elder brother and two elder sisters. [4] His brother Dipu Santhan owns a music company in Kochi and his eldest sister Nivedita is a television actress in Kerala. Sreesanth's elder sister Divya got married to Madhu Balakrishnan , a famous South Indian playback singer.
On 12 December 2013, Sreesanth married his girlfriend Bhuvneshwari Kumari of Jaipur's Shekhawat family at Guruvayur Sri Krishna temple in Kerala . Bhuvneshwari Kumari aka Nain Shekhawat is the daughter of Hirendra Singh Shekhawat and Muktha Singh. [5]
Early years
Sreesanth initially was a leg-spinner in his childhood, modelling his action on India's leading Test wicket-taker Anil Kumble , who was to become his Test captain. However, his habit of bowling yorkers led him to convert to fast bowling, after being encouraged by his elder brother. [6] Following in the footsteps of fellow Kerala fast bowler Tinu Yohannan , who earned selection to the National Cricket Academy in 2000, Sreesanth was selected for the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai . He then made his first-class debut against Goa in the 2002–03 domestic season, claiming 22 wickets in seven matches in the Ranji Trophy [7] and winning selection for South Zone in the Duleep Trophy squad in the same season. [8]
He was selected for India-A side in a tour match against the visiting New Zealand side at Rajkot . He claimed one wicket in twelve overs after being restricted with a hamstring injury. He also missed five Ranji Trophy games in that season, although he still travelled with the side for away games. This led to rumours that an astrologer convinced him to take a break from competition to preserve his longevity in the sport, which Sreesanth categorically denied, maintaining that he was training only to regain his fitness. [6]
In November 2004, Sreesanth entered the record books when he took a hat-trick against Himachal Pradesh in a Ranji trophy game.[ citation needed ] He was selected to represent India B in the Challenger Trophy in October 2005, a domestic limited-overs tournament. [9] He performed impressively in that tournament, earning the Man of the Series award and being the leading wicket taker (7) with the third best bowling average. [10] This led to his selection to Indian team for the home ODI series against Sri Lanka . [11]
ODI career
Sreesanth was given the new ball [12] in the first ODI against Sri Lanka in Nagpur . After being punished early by Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya , Sreesanth returned to claim his first two ODI wickets at the end of the match. [13] He was left out of the team and was later recalled for the fourth, fifth and sixth ODIs as coach Greg Chappell tinkered with the line-up. He was retained in the squad [14] but did not play in the 5 match series against South Africa , but played all five matches in the tour to Pakistan, recording a haul of 4/58 in the fifth ODI against Pakistani cricket team in Karachi . A good home series against the England in April 2006, in which he claimed 10 wickets at an average of 16.3, including a career best 6/55 in the final match at Indore (in which he was awarded the man of the match award [1] ), [15] led to him subsequently being awarded a BCCI contract, in the C-grade in May. [16]
His disappointing economy rate led him to be left out of the ICC Champions Trophy squad of 14, with the beneficiary being R. P. Singh . He made an unexpected come back to the blue squad due to the injury to Ajit Agarkar later in the tournament. He was also out of the Indian ODI team for the England tour.
In the 2011 Cricket World Cup , Sreesanth was selected due to injury to Praveen Kumar . He was expensive in the first game going wicketless at 53 runs in 5 overs. He was selected in the final where he gave away 52 runs in 8 wicketless overs.
Test career
Sreesanth bowling in the nets.
Sreesanth was selected for his first Test squad in the home series against England in March 2006, in place of Zaheer Khan . He claimed 4/95 in his debut appearance in the 1st Test in Nagpur , where he opened the bowling with Irfan Pathan . [17] He was ruled out of the second Test in Mohali due to illness, but recovered and captured five wickets as well a 29* with the bat in the Third Test in Mumbai . With the axing of Pathan, Sreesanth became India's leading pace bowler on the tour of the West Indies . He missed the second Test due to an injury but managed to claim his best match figures of 5/72 in the 4th Test in Kingston, Jamaica . [18]
Sreesanth playing for India against Somerset in 2011.
Sreesanth's most significant performance to date in Test cricket was his role in the first Test of India's 2006 tour to South Africa at Johannesburg . After losing the limited-overs series 4–0, Sreesanth produced took 5–40 in a display of pace and swing to help dismiss South Africa. This performance helped to bowl South Africans out for just 84, leading to first Indian win on South African soil, for which he was named man of the match. Again, Sreesanth's emotional antics, which have led him to be regarded by some commentators as eccentric, were frequently noted. He was fined after breaching the International Cricket Council 's advertising logo policy, and also for "conduct contrary to the spirit of the game" after sending off Hashim Amla after dismissing him. [19] He was also involved in a highly publicised confrontation while batting against paceman André Nel . Nel delivered a series of fast balls at Sreesanth's upper body and after Sreesanth ungainly evaded one delivery, taunted him by gesturing to his chest, indicating that he felt Sreesanth was lacking in courage. On the next ball, Sreesanth gave him the charge and hit the ball straight over the bowler's head into the stands for a six. He then whirled his bat in enthusiasm and danced down the wicket, making fun of Nel and performing a dance. [20] Later, Sreesanth said that he would not repeat anything of the sort, since he could be suspended for violating the code of conduct. [21] Even though he went unpunished for the Nel incident, he was fined 30% of the match fee for running towards Hashim Amla after picking up his wicket, and wearing a branded garment under the jersey.
Sreesanth courted controversy once again during the fourth day of the second test of India's 2007 tour to England at Trent Bridge . He was fined half of his match fee for deliberately shoulder barging England captain Michael Vaughan whilst walking back to his mark. He also bowled a beamer at batsman Kevin Pietersen , which the latter had to take drastic action to avoid. Sreesanth however did immediately apologise afterwards. After the match he said that the ball had slipped from his hand. Soon afterwards, he bowled a no-ball where he overstepped the crease by roughly 2 feet (0.61 m), leading to speculation it was deliberate; the delivery was a bouncer to Paul Collingwood . Former England captain Michael Atherton called for Sreesanth to be banned for the Pietersen beamer, saying that Sreesanth could not control his on-pitch emotions. [2] [3]
After leaving out of the Indian team for about a year and half, Sreesanth was called back to play the home Test series against Sri Lanka in November 2009. Sreesanth played the second Test in Kanpur and picked up five wickets in the first innings, which helped India win the match by an innings and 144 runs. [22] Sreesath was awarded the Man of the Match for taking six wickets in the match. [23] After the match, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni praised him as one of the best bowlers of reverse swing . [24]
World Twenty20 Championship, 2007
In September 2007, Sreesanth joined the Indian team in South Africa for the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup following his omission for the one-day series in England. Although his performance in the tournament lacked consistency, Sreesanth managed breakthroughs at critical junctures that were vital to his team's success. During the semifinal match against Australia which India won, Sreesanth got the vital wickets of the Australian openers Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden . The latter proved to be decisive in turning the match round in India's favour. In the final against Pakistan, Sreesanth proved expensive with the ball, but became the centre of Indian celebrations as he held on to the catch in the last over that ended Pakistan's innings and made India World Twenty20 champions.
Warwickshire
In August 2009, Sreesanth signed a deal to play for Warwickshire for the remainder of the English season.
Indian Premier League
Sreesanth is currently associated with the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League . In the inaugural edition of the IPL in 2008, Sreesanth became the second leading wicket taker in the tournament after Sohail Tanveer, claiming 18 wickets. Sreesanth appeared only in the second half of the 2009 edition of the IPL. He could not play the initial matches of the season owing to a stress fracture. He left Kings XI Punjab after the 2010 Indian Premier League and signed for Kochi for the 2011 competition .He signed for Rajasthan royals for the 2012 competition . But he didn't play in 2012 due to injuries. With his spot-fixing controversy coming into light during the 2013 IPL competition , Rajasthan Royals terminated his contract. [25]
Altercation with Harbhajan Singh
On 25 April 2008, following the victory of his Kings XI Punjab 's victory in the Indian Premier League over the Mumbai Indians at Mohali , Sreesanth was slapped under his eye by Harbhajan Singh , the captain of Mumbai. The incident came to light as Sreesanth was caught by TV cameras sobbing inconsolably on the field before the presentation ceremony. Sreesanth later downplayed the incident saying he had no complaints against Harbhajan who was "like an elder brother" to him. Harbhajan's team had lost their third consecutive match when he apparently reacted violently to Sreesanth's approaching him and saying "hard luck". The IPL banned Harbhajan from the remainder of the tournament and prohibited him from collecting his salary after finding him guilty. The BCCI launched a separate investigation into the incident and decided to ban Harbhajan for five ODIs, deeming him to have broken the code of conduct in his national contract. [26] [27] [28] [29] In Australia earlier that year, Sreesanth stated that he would maintain an aggressive attitude on the cricket field, "Sreesanth's way is to be aggressive. Sreesanth will always remain Sreesanth." [30]
Spot fixing allegation and arrest

On 16 May 2013, the Delhi police arrested Sreesanth and two of his Rajasthan Royals teammates, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan from Mumbai, on charges of spot-fixing during IPL 6 . [31] [32] Jiju Janardhan, another key figure accused of spot-fixing, is reported to be Sreesanth's cousin and an under-22 Gujarat player. [33] On 17 May 2013, Sreesanth confessed to spot-fixing, according to police. [34] However, Sreesanth has always maintained that he is innocent and that he was forced to sign confession statements.
Police reported that Sreesanth was drunk at the time of his arrest and thought he was being arrested for being drunk. When the Delhi police team intercepted him, he was reportedly accompanied with a woman in a SUV outside a five-star hotel in Carter Road Promenade , Mumbai. [1] [35] [ clarification needed ]
Sreesanth, and the two other players accused of spot fixing had their Rajasthan Royals contracts suspended while their inquiries were pending. [36] On 13 September 2013, Sreesanth and Ankeet Chavan were banned for life by BCCI 's disciplinary committee. [37]
In July 2015, hecoach Peter Moores .
Afterwards, England's Test record was indifferent and the team slumped to fifth in the ICC rankings. There was a convincing 3–0 Test series win over West Indies in 2007 but it was followed in the second half of the summer by a 1–0 loss to India , although England did defeat India 4–3 in the ODI series .
In 2007–08, England toured Sri Lanka and New Zealand , losing the first series 1–0 and winning the second 2–1. They followed up at home in May 2008 with a 2–0 home series win against New Zealand , these results easing the pressure on Moores, who was not at ease with his team, particularly star batsman Kevin Pietersen , who succeeded Vaughan as captain in June 2008, after England had been well beaten by South Africa at home .
The poor relationship between Moores and Pietersen came to a head in India on the 2008–09 tour . England lost the series 1–0 and both men resigned their positions, although Pietersen remained a member of the England team. Moores was replaced as coach by Zimbabwean Andy Flower . Against this background, England toured the West Indies under the captaincy of Andrew Strauss and, in a disappointing performance, lost the Test series 1–0.
The second Twenty20 World Cup was held in England in 2009 but England suffered an opening day defeat to the Netherlands. They recovered to defeat both eventual champions Pakistan and reigning champions India but were then knocked out by West Indies.
This was followed by the 2009 Ashes series which featured the first Test match played in Wales, at Sophia Gardens , Cardiff. England drew that match thanks to a last wicket stand by bowlers James Anderson and Monty Panesar . A victory for each team followed before the series was decided at The Oval . Thanks to fine bowling by Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann and a debut century by Jonathan Trott , England regained the Ashes.
Since 2010[ edit ]
After a drawn Test series in South Africa , England won their first ever ICC tournament, the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 . The following winter, they thrashed Australia 3–1 to retain the Ashes; it was their first series win in Australia for 24 years, and included three innings victories and 766 runs by opener Alastair Cook .
England struggled to match their Test form in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup . Despite beating South Africa and tying with eventual winners India, England suffered shock losses to Ireland and Bangladesh before losing in the quarter-finals to Sri Lanka. [20] However the team's excellent form in the Test match arena continued and they became the world's top ranked Test team after comfortably whitewashing India 4–0 , their sixth consecutive series victory and eighth in the past nine series. However, this status only lasted a year – having lost 3–0 to Pakistan over the winter, England were beaten 2–0 by South Africa , who replaced them at the top of the rankings. It was their first home series loss since 2008, against the same opposition.
This loss saw the resignation of Strauss as captain (and his retirement from cricket). His replacement, Alastair Cook, who was already in charge of the ODI side, led England to a 2–1 victory in India – their first in the country since 1984–85. In doing so, Cook became the first ever captain to score centuries in his first five Tests as captain and became England's leading century-maker with 23 hundreds.
After finishing as runners-up in the ICC Champions Trophy , England faced Australia in back-to-back Ashes series. A 3–0 home win secured England the urn for the fourth time in five series. However, in the return series , they found themselves utterly demolished in a 5–0 defeat, their second Ashes whitewash in under a decade. Their misery was compounded by batsman Jonathan Trott leaving the tour early due to a stress-related illness and the mid-series retirement of spinner Graeme Swann . Following the tour, head coach Andy Flower resigned his post whilst batsman Kevin Pietersen was dropped indefinitely from the England team. [21] Flower was replaced by his predecessor, Peter Moores, but he was sacked for a second time after a string of disappointing results including failing to advance from the group stage at the 2015 World Cup .

Main article: History of the West Indian cricket team
Learie Constantine , who played Test cricket in the 1920s and 1930s, was one of the first great West Indian players.
The West Indies have won four major tournament titles: the World Cup twice, the Champions Trophy once, and most recently the World Twenty20 once. The last was under the captaincy of Darren Sammy in October 2012.
The history of the West Indies cricket team began in the 1890s, when the first representative sides were selected to play visiting English sides. The WICB joined the sport's international ruling body, the Imperial Cricket Conference , in 1926, [4] and played their first official international match, granted Test status, in 1928, [5] thus becoming the fourth Test nation.
The last series the West Indies played before the outbreak of the Second World War was against England in 1939. There followed a hiatus that lasted until January 1948 when the MCC toured the West Indies. [6] Of the West Indies players in that first match after the war only Gerry Gomez , George Headley , Jeffrey Stollmeyer , and Foffie Williams had previously played Test cricket. [7] In 1948, leg spinner Wilfred Ferguson became the first West Indian bowler to take ten wickets in a Test, finishing with 11/229 in a match against England; [8] later that same year Hines Johnson became the first West Indies fast bowler to achieve the feat, managing 10/96 against the same opponents. [9] Although blessed with some great players in their early days as a Test nation, and beating England for the first time at Lord's on 29 June 1950, their successes remained sporadic until the 1960s when the side changed from a white-dominated to a black-dominated side. By the 1970s, the West Indies had a side recognised as unofficial world champions, a reputation they retained throughout the 1980s. [10] During these glory years, the West Indies were noted for their four-man fast bowling attack, backed up by some of the best batsmen in the world. In 1976, fast bowler Michael Holding took 14/149 in a Test against England, setting a record which still stands for best bowling figures in a Test by a West Indies bowler. [11] [12]
The 1980s saw the team set a then-record streak of 11 consecutive Test victories in 1984 and inflict two 5–0 " blackwashes " against the old enemy of England . Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, however, West Indian cricket declined, largely owing to the failure of the West Indian Cricket Board to move the game from an amateur pastime to a professional sport, coupled with the general economic decline in West Indian countries, and the team is struggling to regain its past glory.
In their early days in the 1930s, the side represented the British colonies that would later form the West Indies Federation plus British Guiana .
Flag and anthem[ edit ]
Former flag of the West Indies cricket team used until 1999. This flag became public domain . The current version is similar to this but the new one is copyrighted .
Most cricketing nations use their own national flags for cricketing purposes. However, as the West Indies represent a number of independent states and dependencies, there is no natural choice of flag. The WICB has, therefore, developed an insignia showing a palm tree and cricket stumps on a small sunny island (see the top of this article). This insignia, on a maroon background, makes up the West Indian flag. The background sometimes has a white stripe above a green stripe, which is separated by a maroon stripe, passing horizontally through the middle of the background. [13] Prior to 1999, the WICB(C) had used a similar insignia featuring a palm tree and an island, but there were no stumps and, instead of the sun, there was the constellation Orion .

Hindi : मुनाफ मूसा पटेल , Urdu : مناف موسی پٹیل‎ ) (born 12 July 1983, Ikhar, Gujarat , India) is a former Indian cricketer who has also played for the West Zone in the Duleep Trophy and Gujarat , Mumbai cricket team and Maharashtra cricket team .
Patel first gained prominence in 2003 at the age of 20 before he had even played first class cricket for Gujarat, when he was invited to the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai by the Indian chairman of selectors Kiran More . There he attracted the attention of visiting Australian captain Steve Waugh , and the director Dennis Lillee , a former Australian fast bowler, with his raw pace. With the backing of Sachin Tendulkar , he was signed by Mumbai in a transfer deal, in late 2003, without ever representing his native Gujarat.
In 2004, he struggled with injuries, and was criticised by India A coach Sandeep Patil , who believed that he had a mental problem dealing with his injuries. He was also sent to Australian Institute of Sport for bio-mechanical analysis on his bowling action, to improve its efficiency. In August 2005, he transferred to Maharashtra, and after taking 10 wickets against England in a tour match for the Board President's XI, he was rewarded with his selection in the Indian Test Squad for the 2nd Test against England in Mohali , when he made his Test debut. Patel recorded the figures of 7/97 on debut, including 4/25 in the second innings and demonstrated an ability to swing the ball in both directions.
In the 2005–2006 Test Series against West Indies , Munaf proved he was arguably the fastest bowler in India, bowling regularly at speeds of over 85 miles per hour (137 km/h) and has produced balls at a pace over the 90 miles per hour (140 km/h) mark.[ citation needed ] However, more impressive than his ability to bowl at a very quick pace has been his control, a skill lacking in recent Indian fast bowlers. In the West Indies, however, Munaf suffered the ignominy of being hit for 6 fours in an over by Ramnaresh Sarwan . Patel fell short of the record of conceding the most runs off an over by 4 runs.
In the second match of the DLF Cup in Malaysia, Munaf came up with figures of 3/54 against Australia, picking up the wickets of Phil Jacques , Michael Clarke and Stuart Clark . In the final game of the same tournament, he dismissed Australian captain Ricky Ponting for just 4, on the way to 1/32 off 9 overs.
In the first match of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy against England, Munaf Patel again produced figures of 3/18 – winning the match for India and gaining the man of the match award.
He was part of the Indian 2007 World Cup squad which failed to progress from the group stage and played during India's One-day International series against Bangladesh shortly after the tournament before playing two games in England in August 2007. He took four wickets before being ruled out of the remainder of the series through injury. He was subsequently left out of the squad to play Pakistan in November although was recalled to the Test squad following injuries to R. P. Singh and S. Sreesanth . [1]
He was selected for the 2009 tour to Sri Lanka and played in the opening match. He bowled five wicketless overs for 32 runs. He then picked up a groin injury before the second match and was replaced in the squad by Lakshmipathy Balaji . [2]
He was brought back into the ODI squad for India's last preparatory series before the 2011 World Cup , with the series taking place in South Africa. After India were beaten in the first match, they made only 190 when M S Dhoni chose to bat first in the second match. However, Patel put in a Man of the Match performance to return personal best figures of 4/29 off nine overs, taking the final wicket of Wayne Parnell to lead India to a 1-run victory,[ citation needed ] India's first against South Africa in South Africa since 2003. He was eventually named in India's World Cup squad. In India's first World Cup match against Bangladesh, Patel took four wickets, albeit with India defending a comfortable 370 from their innings. In the match against England, Patel's catch off his own bowling to dismiss Kevin Pietersen broke up an opening partnership in a match which England and India would eventually tie.[ citation needed ] He played an important role in the India Pakistan semi-final match at Mohali where he performed well and also played in the finals of the World Cup.
He was a part of Mumbai Indians till IPL 6 after playing three seasons with Rajasthan Royals. However in 2014 IPL Auctions,he was unsold by having a low base price of 10 Lakhs only

Physics of swing bowling[ edit ]
The Philadelphians' Bart King helped to perfect swing bowling in the early 20th century[ citation needed ]
The essence of swing bowling is to get the cricket ball to deviate sideways as it moves through the air towards or away from the batsman . In order to do this, the bowler makes use of five factors:
The raised seam of the cricket ball
The wear and tear on the ball
The polishing liquid used on the ball
The speed of the delivery
The bowler's action
The asymmetry of the ball is encouraged by the constant polishing of one side of the ball by members of the fielding team, while allowing the opposite side to deteriorate through wear and tear. With time, this produces a marked difference in the aerodynamic properties of the two sides.
Both turbulent and laminar airflow contribute to swing. Air in laminar flow separates from the surface of the ball earlier than air in turbulent flow, so that the separation point moves toward the front of the ball on the laminar side. On the turbulent flow side it remains towards the back, inducing a greater lift force on the turbulent airflow side of the ball. The calculated net lift force is not enough to account for the amount of swing observed. Additional force is provided by the pressure-gradient force .
To induce the pressure-gradient force the bowler must create regions of high and low static pressure on opposing sides of the ball. The ball is then "sucked" from the region of high static pressure towards the region of low static pressure. The Magnus effect utilises the same force but by manipulating spin across the direction of motion. A layer of fluid, in this case air, will have a greater velocity when moving over another layer of fluid than it would have had if it had been moving over a solid, in this case the surface of the ball. The greater the velocity of the fluid, the lower its static pressure.
When the ball is new the seam is used to create a layer of turbulent air on one side of the ball, by angling it to one side and spinning the ball along the seam. This changes the separation points of the air with the ball; this turbulent air creates a greater coverage of air, providing lift. The next layer of air will have a greater velocity over the side with the turbulent air due to the greater air coverage and as there is a difference in air velocity, the static pressure of both sides of the ball are different and the ball is both 'lifted' and 'sucked' towards the turbulent airflow side of the ball.
When the ball is older and there is an asymmetry in roughness the seam no longer causes the pressure difference, and can actually reduce the swing of the ball. Air turbulence is no longer used to create separation point differences and therefore the lift and pressure differences. On the rough side of the ball there are scratches and pits in the ball's surface. These irregularities act in the same manner as the dimples of a golf ball: they trap the air, creating a layer of trapped air next to the rough side of the ball, which moves with the surface of the ball. The smooth side does not trap a layer of air. The next layer of air outward from the ball will have a greater velocity over the rough side, due to its contact with a layer of trapped air, rather than solid ball. This lowers the static pressure relative to the shiny side, which swings the ball. If the scratches and tears completely cover the rough side of the ball, the separation point on the rough side will move to the back of the ball, further than that of the turbulent air, thereby creating more lift and faster air flow. This is why a new ball will swing more than an old ball. If the seam is used to create the turbulent air on the rough side, the tears will not fill as quickly as they would with laminar flow, dampening the lift and pressure differences.
Reverse swing occurs in exactly the same manner as conventional swing, despite popular misconception. Over time the rough side becomes too rough and the tears become too deep - this is why golf ball dimples are never below a certain depth, and so "conventional" swing weakens over time; the separation point moves toward the front of the ball on the rough side. When polishing the shiny side of the ball, numerous liquids are used, such as sweat, saliva, sunscreen, hair gel (which bowlers may apply to their hair before a game) and other illegal substances like Vaseline (applied to the clothing where the ball is polished). These liquids penetrate the porous surface of the leather ball. Over time the liquid expands and stretches the surface of the ball (which increases the surface area meaning more lift) and creates raised bumps on the polished side, due to the non-uniform nature of the expansion. The valleys between the bumps hold the air in the same manner as the tears on the rough side. This creates a layer of air over the shiny side, moving the separation point towards the back of the ball on the shiny side. The greater air coverage is now on the shiny side, giving rise to more lift and faster secondary airflow on that side. There is therefore lower static pressure on the shiny side, causing the ball to swing towards it, not away from it as in conventional swing.
The rough side tears hold the air more easily than the shiny side valleys, so to maintain the air within the valleys the initial air layer must have a very high velocity, which is why reverse swing is primarily, but not necessarily, achieved by fast bowlers. Due to the less static nature of the initial air layer it takes longer for the swing to occur, which is why it occurs later in the delivery. This is why conventional and reverse swing can occur in the same delivery.
Cold and humid weather tend to enhance swing, due to the lift force increasing with the density of the air. Colder air is more dense than warm air. The humidity is a measure of the water content in the air; although water vapour does not increase the mean density of the air since water molecules weigh less than nitrogen or oxygen molecules, tiny suspended droplets of condensed liquid water will certainly do so since water is 1000 times more dense than air.
Conventional swing[ edit ]
Jimmy Anderson , a swing bowler for the England cricket team
Typically, a swing bowler aligns the seam and the sides of the ball to reinforce the swing effect. This can be done in two ways:
Outswinger : An outswinger to a right-handed batsman can be bowled by aligning the seam slightly to the left towards the slips and placing the roughened side of the ball on the left. To extract consistent swing, a bowler can also rotate his wrist toward the slips while keeping his arm straight. To a right-handed batsman, this results in the ball moving away to the off side while in flight, usually outwards from his body.
Inswinger : An inswinger to a right-handed batsman can be bowled by aligning the seam slightly to the right and placing the roughened side of the ball on the right. To extract consistent swing, a bowler can also rotate or "open up" his wrist towards leg slip. To a right-handed batsman, this results in the ball moving in to the leg side while in flight, usually inwards towards his body.
The curvature of swing deliveries can make them difficult for a batsman to hit with his bat . Typically, bowlers more commonly bowl outswingers, as they tend to move away from the batsman, meaning he has to "chase" the ball in order to hit it. Hitting away from the batsman's body is dangerous, as it leaves a gap between the bat and body through which the ball may travel to hit the wicket . Also, if the batsman misjudges the amount of swing, he can hit the ball with an edge of the bat. An inside edge can ricochet on to the wicket, resulting in him being out bowled, while an outside edge can fly to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders for a catch.
An inswinger presents relatively fewer dangers to the batsman, but on some particular days can be devastating due to risk of being bowled or leg before wicket . Shane Bond was considered a great exponent of inswing bowling.
An inswinger combined with a yorker can be especially difficult for the batsman to defend against, especially if used as a surprise delivery after a sequence of outswingers.
Reverse swing[ edit ]
Normal swing occurs mostly when the ball is fairly new. As it wears more, the aerodynamics of the asymmetry change and it is more difficult to extract a large amount of swing. When the ball becomes very old—around 40 or more overs old—it begins to swing towards the shine. This is known as reverse swing—meaning a natural outswinger will become an inswinger and vice versa. [1] In essence, both sides have turbulent flow, but here the seam causes the airflow to separate[ clarification needed ] earlier on one side. The result is always a swing to the side with the later separation, so the swing is away from the seam.
Reverse swing tends to be stronger than normal swing, and to occur late in the ball's trajectory. This gives it a very different character from normal swing, and because batsmen experience it less often, they generally find it much more difficult to defend against. It is also possible for a ball to swing normally in its early flight, and then to alter its swing as it approaches the batsman. This can be done in two ways [2] one for the ball to reverse its direction of swing, giving it an 'S' trajectory: the other is for it to adopt a more pronounced swing in the same direction in which the swing is already curving; either alteration can be devastating for the batsman. In the first instance, he is already committed to playing the swing one way, which will be the wrong way to address swing which is suddenly coming from the opposite direction: in the second instance, his stance will be one which is appropriate for the degree, or extent, of the expected swing, and which could suddenly leave him vulnerable to LBW , being caught behind, or bowled. Two consecutive deliveries from Wasim Akram, one of each type, were considered to be the turning point of the 1992 World Cup Final . [2]
Pioneers and notable practitioners of reverse swing have mostly been Pakistani fast bowlers. In the early days of reverse swing, Pakistani bowlers were suspected of ball tampering to achieve the conditions of the ball that allow reverse swing. According to Shaharyar Khan , reverse swing was invented by Salim Mir, who played for the Punjab Cricket Club in Lahore and taught it to his team-mate Sarfraz Nawaz . [3] Sarfraz Nawaz introduced reverse swing into international cricket during the late 1970s, and passed their knowledge on to their team-mate Imran Khan , [4] who in turn taught the duo of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis . The English pair of Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones , having been taught by Troy Cooley and the Indian bowlers like Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar , are also well known for the ability to reverse swing. [5]
Playing swing bowling[ edit ]
Playing swing bowling is considered to be a hallmark of a batsman's skill.
Firstly, a batsman needs good eye reflexes which are considered to be a key skill when facing swing bowling. Secondly a batsman often needs to anticipate beforehand what the ball will do and adjust accordingly to play swing bowling. This can be done by observing the bowler's grip and action (which may have a marked difference depending on which type of swinger is to be delivered), by observing the field set, which may depend on the types of deliveries expected (as a rule outswingers will have more slips assigned) or by means of prior knowledge of the bowler; many can bowl or are proficient in only one type of swing. Traditional methods include the batsmen playing the ball as late as possible, and not playing away from the body. Other effective measures for combating swing bowling include standing well outside the crease, thus giving the ball less time to swing; and guessing the direction of swing based on the seam position observed in the ball's flight.
Since reverse swing occurs at faster speeds, later in the trajectory of the ball and with no real obvious change in action and grip (Waqar Younis from Pakistan for example had the same action and grip for nearly all his deliveries [6] ), batsmen with a quick eye and reflexes will do well. In his autobiography Wasim Akram mentions four batsmen— Rahul Dravid , Brian Lara , Aravinda De Silva and Martin Crowe —who had such reflexes and who were exceedingly difficult to bowl to. [7]
Controversy regarding reverse swing has never left modern cricket, as the Pakistani team was accused of ball tampering by the controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair during the fourth test against England in 2006 when the ball began to reverse swing after the 50th over. [8] His co-umpire Billy Doctrove supported him. A hearing subsequently found that there was insufficient evidence to convict anyone of ball tampering. [9]



Career[ edit ]
Srikkanth played domestic cricket for Tamil Nadu and South Zone. He made his One Day International debut against England in Ahmedabad in 1981, followed two days later by his Test debut against England at Bombay at the age of 21. He opened the innings partnering Sunil Gavaskar . Known for his aggressive batting style, he was an early role model for opening batsmen in future years to adopt a similar approach to take advantage of fielding restrictions in the initial overs.
As he matured, he tempered his aggression somewhat and became a mainstay of the Indian cricket team . He was an integral member of the Indian squad when they won the 1983 Prudential World Cup and 1985 Benson & Hedges World Championship of Cricket . In the 1983 World Cup final against the West Indies, Srikkanth top scored for India. [1]
He was made the captain of the Indian team in 1989. He remained the captain of the team for India's tour of Pakistan in 1989 and managed to draw all the four Tests of the series. But the selectors were disappointed with his batting failures and dropped him. He returned two years later and played for another year before being dropped again. He retired from international cricket in 1993. He was the first Indian player to score a half-century and pick up 5 wickets in an ODI. He achieved this feat against New Zealand at Visakhapatnam in 1988.
Srikkanth holds the unusual distinction of scoring the only run ever scored in international cricket at Ray Mitchell Oval , in Mackay, Australia . The venue hosted its only international match during the 1992 Cricket World Cup , and the match was washed out after two deliveries. [2]
Style[ edit ]
Srikkanth was an opening batsman noted for his aggressive attacking strokes in contrast to his first batting partner and senior Sunil Gavaskar . He was known to take risks even in the early part of the innings, often scoring boundaries over the inner ring of fielders.
Srikkanth with Prime Minister Narendra Modi
After retirement he had a stint as the coach of the India 'A' team. He has since been a broadcaster and commentator with various sports and news channels. On 18 February 2008, Krish Srikkanth was named the ambassador for the Chennai Super Kings franchise of Indian Premier League . [3]
On 27 September 2008, he was appointed the Chief Selector of the Indian Cricket team. [4] His tenure ended in 2012.
On 20 December 2012, Krish Srikkanth was named the ambassador for the Sunrisers Hyderabad franchise of Indian Premier League . [5]
Statistics[ edit ]
Kris Srikkanth's career performance graph.
Srikkanth played 43 Tests for India, scoring 2,062 runs at an average of 29.88. In ODIs, he played 146 matches and scored 4,091 runs at an average of 29.01. He also bowled off spin in ODIs, taking 25 wickets at an average of 25.64.



Playing career[ edit ]
Bangar began his career playing in the youth teams of Maharashtra and Mumbai , but at state level he made his name representing Railways who he has played for since the 1993–94 season. He often opened both the bowling and batting for Railways with his medium-pace bowling and sound defensive batting technique. [2]
In the 2000–01 season, Railways reached the final of the Ranji Trophy where they lost to Baroda . The following season, they went one better and defeated Baroda to win the competition. Bangar's performances had caught the eyes of the selectors and he was called up to the Indian squad for their matches against England in the 2001–02 season. [3]
In only his second Test, he scored 100 not out against Zimbabwe at Nagpur batting at number 7. In the 2002 tour of England, he was promoted to open the innings at Headingley after some poor performances by Wasim Jaffer . He responded with his most important innings for India and made a patient 68 on the first day in an invaluable partnership with Rahul Dravid in difficult swinging and seaming conditions. Later on in the same match he also chipped in with two important wickets to set up a rare innings victory for India away from home.
Bangar was named as part of India's squad for the 2003 Cricket World Cup , but his performances for India began to tail off, and he made his final appearance for his country in 2004, appearing in 12 Test matches and 15 One Day Internationals in all. [4]
He later became the captain of Railways and led them to an 1988. He lost the record to Kapil Dev . Hadlee was the first bowler to reach 400 Test wickets vs India at Christchurch in 1990
Corey Anderson holds record for the second fastest century in the history of One Day International cricket or any other format of international cricket. Playing against West Indies , he scored his ton in just 36 balls. Corey Anderson lost the record to AB de Villiers when AB scored his century in just 31 balls against West Indies.
In a One Day International in 1996, the entire New Zealand team were awarded man of the match in this match against the West Indies, the first such occasion.
Andrew Jones and Martin Crowe held the highest ever 3rd-wicket partnership in Tests which at the time was the highest partnership for any wicket. [19]
Brian Hastings and Richard Collinge together scored 151 runs for the highest ever 10th-wicket partnership against Pakistan in 1973. [19]
Nathan Astle scored Test cricket's fastest ever double century versus England Christchurch 2002. [20] He scored 200 off 153 balls with the second hundred coming off just 39 deliveries. He was eventually out for 222—the dreaded double Nelson . He knocked the first hundred off 114 balls. Astle smashed the record by 59 balls, previously held by Adam Gilchrist Australia vs South Africa Johannesburg 2002.
Brendon McCullum holds the record for most career runs 2105, most sixes 87 & the first batsman to score two centuries 116* vs Australia and 123 vs Bangladesh in Twenty20 International Cricket.
Brendon McCullum held another record for the Highest Individual Score in Twenty20 International Cricket, when he scored 123 vs Bangladesh at Pallekele. He lost the record to Aaron Finch who scored 156* against England at Southampton.
Chris Cairns and his father Lance Cairns are one of the two father-son combinations to each claim 100 Test wickets, South Africa's Peter and Shaun Pollock being the other.
Chris Cairns held the record for the most Test sixes in Tests. [21] He passed Viv Richards record of 84 (vs England, Lord's , London, 2004) and retired from Test cricket with 87. He has since been passed by both Adam Gilchrist (the current record holder) and Brian Lara .
Martin Guptill scored the Highest score in World Cups with 237* in 2015 .
Chris Harris (vs England, Lord's , London, 2004), Daniel Vettori and Chris Cairns are the only New Zealand cricketers to have taken 200 wickets in ODIs. (cricinfo). Christopher Harris and Christopher Cairns are the only two New Zealand cricketers in ODIs to complete the 4000 run / 200 wicket double . The others are Sri Lankan Sanath Jayasuriya , South African Jacques Kallis , Pakistani's Shahid Afridi and Abdul Razzaq and Bangladeshi Shakib Al Hasan ). [22] Chris Harris holds the record for the most ODI caught and bowled dismissals, with 29. [23]
John Bracewell became the first – and so far only – substitute fielder to take four catches in a One-Day International, vs Australia in Adelaide on 23 November 1980.
Daniel Vettori became the first cricketer to take four wickets and score a half-century in each innings of a test match, a feat he achieved against Bangladesh in October 2008 at Chittagong . His figures were 5/95 and 4/74 with the ball and 55* and 76 with the bat. [24]
Notable[ edit ]
New Zealand dismissed Zimbabwe (Harare 2005) twice in the same day for totals of 59 and 99. Zimbabwe became only the second team (after India at Manchester in 1952) to be dismissed twice in the same day. The whole Test was completed inside two days. [25] This feat was then repeated at Napier in 2012 when NZ dismissed Zimbabwe for 51 and 143 to end the match within three days. [26]
Brendon McCullum scored NZ's fastest Test century. (vs Sri Lanka 2014), off 74 balls.
Martin Guptill holds the record for the highest one-day cricket innings by a New Zealander, with 237 Not out against West Indies in the 2015 World Cup 4th Quarter Final in Wellington. [27]
Brendon McCullum scored the fastest World Cup fifty (off 18 balls) for New Zealand in a Pool A Match of 2015 Cricket World Cup against England, beating his own 20-ball record set against Canada in World Cup (2007) earlier.
In a match for the New Zealanders (i.e., the New Zealand national team playing a tour match against non-test opposition) at Scarborough, Yorkshire , in 1986 vs the D.B. Close XI, Ken Rutherford scored 317 runs off just 245 balls, including 228 runs in fours and sixes. In terms of balls faced, this is almost certainly one of the four fastest first-class triple-centuries ever recorded. [28]
Shane Bond took an ODI hat-trick in the last over (innings bowling figures: 10–0–61–4) vs Australia at Hobart in January 2007. [29]
Tim Southee took a Twenty20 hat-trick , taking 5–18 in the match against Pakistan.
Brendon McCullum holds the record for the highest Test innings by a New Zealander of 302 (vs India in 2014).



History[ edit ]
The South African cricket team toured England in 1947. At Nottingham , Captain Alan Melville and vice-captain , Dudley Nourse achieved a Test match record for a third wicket partnership of 319. The following year Nourse, 38-year-old captain of Natal , was appointed Captain for the 1948 MCC Test matches in South Africa. [6]
In 1970 , the ICC voted to suspend South Africa from international cricket indefinitely because of its government's policy of apartheid , a policy which led them to play only against the white nations (England, Australia, New Zealand), and field only white players. This decision excluded players such as Graeme Pollock , Barry Richards and Mike Procter from partaking in international Test Cricket. It would also cause the emigration of future stars like Allan Lamb and Robin Smith , who both played for England, and Kepler Wessels , who initially played for Australia, before returning to South Africa.
The South African team at The Oval in August 2008.
The ICC reinstated South Africa as a Test nation in 1991 after the deconstruction of apartheid, and the team played its first sanctioned match since 1970 (and its first ever One-Day International) against India in Calcutta on 10 November 1991. South Africa's first test match after re-admission was against the West Indies in April 1992. The match was played in Bridgetown, Barbados and South Africa lost by 52 runs.
Since South Africa have been reinstated they have achieved mixed success, and hosted the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup in 2003. However, it is widely believed [7] the sides containing the likes of Allan Donald , Shaun Pollock , Gary Kirsten and Hansie Cronje grossly underachieved, gaining a reputation as " chokers ", due to them reaching the semi-finals of the Cricket World Cup three times, but failing to progress into the finals. In the second part of the 1990s, South Africa had the highest winning percentage in ODIs of any team, but they were knocked out of the 1996 World Cup in the quarter-finals , and then were eliminated on countback after tying their semi-final against Australia in 1999. In 2003, South Africa were one of the favourites but were eliminated by one run in the group stages after they had mistakenly counted the number of runs they needed.
They have also had bad press for failing in vital matches in global tournaments including the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy and the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 . [8]
With Donald retiring, Cronje banned for match-fixing and later killed in a plane crash , and Pollock also retiring from international cricket, the team once again changed shape. Graeme Smith was made captain, although following injuries to Smith and Jacques Kallis , Ashwell Prince deputised as Test captain on 12 July 2006. At the age of 29, he became the first non-white man to captain the once all-white South African cricket team. Due to a racial quota policy, the side was once required to contain black players, unlike the past. However, that policy was rescinded in 2007. [9]
After many of the major players in the Australian side that had dominated the early 2000s had retired, the number one place in the ICC Test Championship was a wide open race, with India and England having short stints as the number one side. South Africa toured England in 2012 for a three Test series with the winner assured of being the world number one. South Africa went on to take the series comfortably 2–0 and claim the top spot in the rankings, a position they have held onto for over a full calendar year. [10]
During this time of dominance in the Test arena, the ODI and T20I performances were far less consistent, as South Africa search for a winning formula ahead of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup . A notable ODI series loss to New Zealand at home in January 2013, and a further loss in Sri Lanka highlighted South Africa's recent difficulties. Exits from the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy only served to improve South Africa's reputation as 'chokers' in major tournaments. In the latter years of Smith's career, South Africa split the captaincy in the shorter forms of the game, with the ODI side being led by AB de Villiers and the T20I side by Faf du Plessis . After Smith's retirement, Hashim Amla was appointed captain of the test side, leading his side to victory in his first test in charge, in Galle in Sri Lanka .
Choking reputation[ edit ]
The South African cricket team has gained a reputation as a frequent choker at global cricket tournaments conducted by the International Cricket Council . Despite being consistently one of the best-performing nations in all forms of cricket since its return from isolation , the Proteas have never progressed beyond the semi-final stage at a World Cup. This reputation was further cemented by the fact that South Africa had never won a game during the knock-out stage of the World Cup; a record which was broken in the quarter-finals of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, when they won against highly rated Sri Lanka. [11] [12]
This reputation arises largely from two events:
In the 1999 Super Six Stage , Herschelle Gibbs dropped eventual centurion Steve Waugh after which Australia went on to win the match, [13] then a shambolic run-out involving Allan Donald and Lance Klusener in the semi-final also against Australia ended South Africa's second innings with the scores tied. Australia progressed on the basis of its superior run rate through the tournament.
In the Proteas' final game of Cricket World Cup 2003's group stage (which was effectively a knock-out match, as they had to win to progress to the Super Six ), South Africa tied the rain-affected game against Sri Lanka which they could have won, after they misinterpreted the Duckworth-Lewis rain rule tables shortly before the match was called off.
In addition to surrendering commanding positions in the above matches, South Africa suffered upset losses against the West Indies in 1996 and New Zealand in 2011 . [14] South Africa's win in the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy remains their only international tournament victory to date. In the 2015 World Cup semi finals against New Zealand, the South Africans batted first, however as a result of a rain interruption the game was halted. New Zealand who were set a Duckworth-Lewis score of 298, chased it down. South Africa lost the game marginally as they missed two run outs and two catches.



2000 – 2009[ edit ]
In 2000, Nepal's youth development policy began to pay off when the Nepal national under-19 cricket team finished eighth in the Under-19 World Cup . The senior side had their best performance to date later in the year when they reached the semi-finals of the 2000 ACC Trophy before losing to Hong Kong at Sharjah . [15] They competed in the ICC Trophy for the first time the following year. In the tournament in Ontario , they beat Germany and Gibraltar , but a loss to eventual runners-up Namibia prevented them from progressing past the first round. [16]
Nepal were runners-up to the UAE in the 2002 ACC Trophy in Singapore [17] and they hosted the ACC Emerging Nations Tournament in 2003, winning easily against Bhutan and the Maldives . They won so comprehensively that they were not invited back to the tournament the next time it was played in 2005. [6] Raju Khadka became the first Nepalese cricketer to score an international century , when he slammed an unbeaten 105 off just 50 balls against Bhutan in the tournament. [18]
Nepal played first-class cricket for the first time in 2004, playing in the ICC Intercontinental Cup against the UAE and Malaysia . They beat Malaysia , [19] but drew with the UAE , [20] failing to reach the semi-final stage. Nepal finished third in the 2004 ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament , which qualified them for the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup , [21] and finished 5th in the 2004 ACC Trophy , which qualified them for the repêchage tournament of the 2005 ICC Trophy . They finished third in this tournament after beating Qatar [22] in a play-off, meaning that they did not qualify for the 2005 ICC Trophy . Shakti Gauchan scored a century against Italy and stayed unbeaten on 106 off 103 balls in the tournament. [23] They beat the UAE and drew with Hong Kong in the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup , but missed out on qualification for the semi-finals by half a point. They were runners-up to the UAE in the 2005 ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament . [24]
In March 2006, Nepal played Namibia in Windhoek in a play-off match to decide the final team in the 2006 ICC Intercontinental Cup . Nepal needed to win outright to qualify for the main tournament, but the match was drawn after there was no play on the first day. [25] Later in the year, they toured Pakistan , playing against the Pakistan Cricket Academy [26] before playing in the 2006 ACC Trophy in Kuala Lumpur .
In the 2006 ACC Trophy , Nepal bowled Myanmar out for just 10 off 12.1 overs after Nepal won the toss and sent Myanmar in; no batsman scored more than one, the innings included five ducks, and extras top scored with five (three leg byes and two wides). Mehboob Alam and Binod Das picked up seven wickets and three wickets respectively. [27] In reply, Nepal hit three off the first ball, followed by three wides that went for five, and then hit another three from the second legitimate delivery to win by ten wickets. Some critics called it the greatest mismatch in the history of international cricket [28] and the score of 10 is the lowest in any level of men's international cricket. They finished fourth in the tournament after losing to Afghanistan in a play-off. [29] They won the ACC Premier League in 2006. [30]
They played in the 2007 ACC Twenty20 Cup in Kuwait , where they finished fourth in their first round group. [31]
In May 2008, Nepal traveled to Jersey to play in 2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Five of the World Cricket League . Mehboob Alam set the world record by taking all ten wickets in the match against Mozambique . He got his name in the Guinness World Records for becoming the first bowler to take all 10 wickets in an ICC international cricket match with limited overs. [32] Nepal topped Group A after the group qualifying matches but lost to Afghanistan in the semi-final [33] and finished third overall after defeating the USA in the playoff for third place. [34] With only the top two from this tournament qualifying for 2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Four in Tanzania later in the year, Nepal missed out on the chance to take their 2011 World Cup dream any further. Later, Nepal appeared in the 2008 ACC Trophy Elite and finished fourth after losing to the UAE in the semi-final [35] and to Afghanistan in the playoff for third place. [36]
Nepal finished fifth in the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup after beating Singapore by 9 wickets in the playoff for fifth place. [37] In a group match against Kuwait , Nepal needed 7 runs off the last ball to win. Binod Bhandari , making his debut for the national team, hit a last-ball six to tie the match. Eventually Nepal won the match in bowl-out . [38]
2010 – 2014[ edit ]
Nepal won their first major tournament, beating USA in the final of 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Five held at Kathmandu in February 2010. [39] Sharad Vesawkar scored a century and stayed unbeaten on 105 off 134 balls against Fiji in the tournament. [40] Nepal played very well in 2010 ACC Trophy Elite , winning all the matches inother Ranji Trophy victory in 2004–05. He represented Deccan Chargers in the IPL first season. He played for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2009 IPL. His introduction to KKR led difference between captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Buchanan .
In January 2013, Bangar announced his retirement after 20 year seasons. [5] An article by Sanjay Bangar was featured in the 2012 book Rahul Dravid: Timeless Steel
Coaching career[ edit ]
He had coached India A . He worked with the Kochi Tuskers as batting coach in 2010. He was in race to replace Pravin Amre as head coach of Mumbai cricket team .
In January 2014, Banger was named assistant coach of Kings XI Punjab ahead of IPL 2014. Later he was promoted to head coach during the season and coached them to final of season where they lost to Kolkata Knight Raiders . [6]
In August 2014, he was named batting coach of India after embarrassing Test series defeat to England. [7]



Early years[ edit ]
Irfan Pathan was born in the western Indian city of Vadodara (former Baroda)
Pathan was born 27 October 1984 in Baroda , Gujarat, India and is of Pashtun (Pathan) ancestry, belonging to the Pathan community in Gujarat . [6] He grew up with his half-brother Yusuf in a mosque in Vadodara , in an impoverished family. His father served as the muezzin . Although their parents wished them to become Islamic scholars, Pathan and his brother took an interest in cricket. Their games on the grounds off and inside the mosque often necessitated apologies from their father to Muslim worshippers who visited it. In the beginning his deliveries did not reach the other end of the cricket pitch , but rigorous six-hour training sessions in blazing heat and his family's sense of discipline saw him progress steadily. Under the guidance of former Indian captain Datta Gaekwad , Pathan rose to get selected in the Under-14 Baroda cricket team , and when he was selected at Under-15 level to represent Baroda in a national tournament, he was finally presented with a full set of cricket equipment, having before been restricted to second-hand gear due to his family's limited economic means. [3] [7]
In December 1997, Pathan broke into the Baroda Under-16 team, [8] less than two months after turning 13. He took a total of 1/35 and scored 1 and 11 against Gujarat and was dropped immediately afterwards. He did not play again for the Under-16s for two years, and in November 1999, less than a month after turning 15, he made his next appearance, this time for Baroda Under-19s against Maharashtra . He scored 61 and 9 and took a total of 3/41 in a victory, but was immediately dropped back to the Under-16s for the next match, and spent the rest of the 1999–2000 season there. He bowled short spells in the younger division, taking four wickets at 38.00 in six matches, averaging less than seven overs an innings. He had more success with the bat, scoring 253 runs at 31.62 including a best of 72 against Mumbai .
Pathan was then selected for the India Under-15 team in mid-2000 to play a series of matches against their colleagues from other countries. He took 15 wickets at 12.66 in ten matches, including a best of 3/2 against Thailand , and scored 15 runs at 7.50. [8] India won all but one of the matches, most by enormous margins. [8]
At the start of the 2000–01 season, Pathan was immediately back in the Under-19s, this time bowling more, often delivering more than 20 overs per innings. In four matches, he scored 102 runs at 102.00 including a best of 63 not out, and took 10 wickets at 32.50. He was then promoted to the Under-22s, where he scored 44 and took 4/71 in his first match against Saurashtra , prompting the Baroda selectors to propel him into the senior team. [8]
==Senior beginnings he is very good my t against Bengal in March 2001, after fellow left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan was selected for the national team. He scored 13 not out and 2, and took 3/40 and 2/68 in a 222-run win. However, he was unable to repeat this form in the three remaining matches, taking only two more wickets in total, but Baroda nevertheless managed to win the Ranji Trophy . He ended his maiden season with seven wickets at 43.28 and 75 runs at 12.50 with a best score of 40 not out against Orissa . [8]
The Ranji win saw Baroda qualify for the following season's Irani Trophy where they took on the Rest of India. Pathan scored 32 in the second innings and took 3/95 and 1/34 in a defeat, [8] but his performance reminded Test batsman V. V. S. Laxman of Zaheer. [3] However, he was omitted from the senior team and sent back to the Under-19s the next week and stayed there for the next two months, playing eight double-innings matches for Baroda. He took 20 wickets at 20.40, including a best of 6/41 against Gujarat, and scoring 190 runs at 31.66 with a best of 63 not out. [8] Pathan was then recalled to the senior team and made his List A debut against Mumbai, taking 1/69 from nine overs. Pathan further honed his bowling at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai , after being referred by Indian selector Kiran More . [3]
In early-2002, he was selected for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand , where he took six wickets at 27.50 and scored 30 runs at 15.00, taking 2/18 in a win over South Africa. [9]
Upon returning to India, Pathan was selected in a senior zonal team for the first time. He was selected for West Zone for the Duleep Trophy , even though he had not played a single match for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy season. He immediately repaid the selectors' faith by taking 4/74 and 6/72, his first ten-wicket match haul, in the first fixture against Central Zone , setting up a 161-run win. In the next match, he took 4/72 and 3/85 as West defeated North by 178 runs. [8] He only took 1/55 in the next match against South but West were through to the final, where he took 4/43 to help cut down East Zone for 162 in the first innings, sealing the title. [8] In all Pathan, had taken 22 wickets at 18.22 for the tournament, and scored 46 runs at 11.50. [8]
These performances propelled Pathan into the India A team at the age of 17 and a half, for a tour of Sri Lanka, where he took six wickets at 35.00 in three first-class matches. Pathan then went on an India Under-19 tour of England in mid-2002. He took 15 wickets at 25.93 in the three youth Tests, which India lost 1–0, with a best of 4/83 in the Second Test. [8] He then took four wickets at 42.00, conceding more than six runs an over, and scored 66 runs at 33.00 in the three youth ODIs, which India won 2–1. [8]
Pathan was rewarded with selection in the Rest of India team that played against Railways in the Irani Trophy at the start of the 2002–03 season. He took a total of 2/84 and scored 29 as the Ranji champions prevailed. [8] He struggled in the Ranji Trophy, taking 18 wickets at 39.33 in seven matches. Half of his wickets came in one match against Orissa in which he claimed 6/31 and 3/46 in an innings victory. [8] He scored 161 runs at 23.00, with a 54 against Tamil Nadu being his maiden first-class fifty, as well as two other forties. [8] Despite a lack of wickets for Baroda, Pathan was selected for the Duleep Trophy, playing for Elite Group A. He took 5/88 and 4/106 against Plate Group A and 4/101 against Elite Group C, before taking 3/53 and 2/42 as Elite Group A defeated Elite Group B in the final by seven wickets. Pathan ended the tournament with 19 wickets at 27.00 and scored 72 runs at 24.00. [8] In the one-dayers, Pathan also struggled for Baroda, taking three wickets at 64.66 in four matches at an economy rate of 4.85, but he was nevertheless selected for the zonal team, where he took four wickets at 34.25 in four matches at an economy rate of 3.91. [8]
In 2003 he was selected for the India A team which travelled to England. Playing in five first-class matches, Pathan took nine wickets at 43.77, including 4/60 against Yorkshire and 3/83 against South Africa . [8] He managed only 8 runs at 4.00 with the bat. He had more success in the limited-overs matches, taking eight wickets at 11.12 in three matches, including a 4/19 against Lancashire , and scoring 27 runs at 27.00. [8]
At the start of the 2003–04 season, Pathan played in the domestic Challenger Trophy for the first time. Representing India A, he had little success, taking two wickets at 79.00 at an economy rate of 5.85, [8] and he did not force his way into India's limited-overs team. [7] [8] [10] He was then selected for India Emerging Players for a series of limited-overs matches against counterparts from Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Pathan took seven wickets at 11.00 in three matches, including 4/22 and 3/35 in two matches against Pakistan. [8]
In late 2003, he was selected for the India Under-19 team to compete in an Asian youth ODI competition in Pakistan, where he was the leading bowler with 18 wickets at 7.38, with an economy rate of 3.54. This was more than twice that of the second leading wicket-taker. He was named as the player of the tournament, which India won after defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final. [11] Pathan was featured on the headlines when he claimed 9/16 against Bangladesh, helping to bowl them out for 34, and helped India to emerge victorious over Sri Lanka in the final, taking 3/33. [12] Pathan also scored 94 runs at 31.33 with the bat, compiling scores of 32, 28 and 34. [8] Pathan returned to India and took 3/51 and 1/33 and scored 26 and 12 in his first Ranji Trophy match for the season, against Andhra Pradesh . [8] This resulted in him being selected for the Indian national squad for the 2003–04 Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series in Australia. [7]
Early international career (2003–2005)[ edit ]
Pathan made his Test debut in December 2003, following an injury to the Baroda left-armer Zaheer Khan
Pathan made his Test debut in the Second Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in December 2003. At the age of 19, he opened the bowling following an injury to the Baroda left-armer Zaheer Khan in the First Test. In a high scoring match, he took the wicket of Matthew Hayden while giving away 160 runs at almost five runs an over. [13] He scored one in his only innings as India took a four-wicket victory. [8] He was dropped for the following Test upon the return of Zaheer, but was recalled for the Fourth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Zaheer broke down in his only spell in the Third Test. On another flat pitch, Pathan took the wickets of Steve Waugh , Adam Gilchrist in the first innings in a spell of reverse swing bowling. He had Waugh caught behind from an outswinger and then bowled Gilchrist with an inswinging yorker . He ended with 2/80 in the first innings and dismissed Ricky Ponting in the second innings to end with match figures of 3/106. [14]
In the ODI tri-nation tournament against Australia and Zimbabwe that followed, Pathan was the leading wicket-taker with 16 wickets at an average of 31 in his maiden ODI series. [15] After ending with 0/61 from ten overs on debut against Australia, he bounced back to take 3/64 and 3/51 in the next two matches against the World Cup holders. He earned his first international man of the match award in the tournament, after taking 4/24 against Zimbabwe at the WACA Ground in Perth in his eighth ODI. [16] [17] [18] However, his tour ended on a bad note after he was reprimanded by match referees for mocking the Australian batsman Damien Martyn after his dismissal in the second final. [19] In that match, he took 2/75 as Australia amassed 5/359 and crushed India by 208 runs. Pathan made 30 in the match as his team folded for only 151. His batting improved towards the end of the tour with three scores of at least 19 in his last four innings, and he ended with 86 runs at 17.20 for the tournament. [8]
Pathan subsequently led the pace attack again on the 2004 Test tour to Pakistan, taking 12 wickets and bowling a higher proportion of maiden overs than any other bowler to help secure India's first series victory over Pakistan in two decades. [3] In the first innings, he bowled 28 overs and took 4/100 to help India restrict their arch-rivals to 407 and take a 268-run lead. After stand-in captain Rahul Dravid enforced the follow on , Pathan tied the Pakistanis down, bowling 12 maidens in his 21 overs to end with 2/26 as India secured an innings win. Pathan then scored 49 in the Second Test in Lahore after a batting collapse of the top order, helping India to recover to 287. [14] However this was not enough as Pakistan reached 489 despite Pathan bowling 44 overs to take 3/107, and the hosts went on to complete a nine-wicket win. In the deciding Test in Rawalpindi , Pathan took 2/49 and 1/35 in an innings win. He ended the series with 12 wickets at 28.50 and 64 runs at 21.33. [8]
He also continued his prolific wicket-taking in the ODIs, taking eight wickets at 17.87 at an economy rate of 4.76 in three matches, including three top-order wickets in the deciding fifth ODI in Lahore. [16] [20] He also scored 36 runs at 36.00 in the ODIs. [8] His ability to swing the ball both ways and his innings in Lahore led to speculation that he could become an all rounder. [21] In recognition of his performances at the start of his international career, Pathan was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year in 2004. [22]
Pathan continued his productive form in ODIs at the 2004 Asian Cup in Sri Lanka , where he was the leading wicket-taker with 14 wickets at 16.28 at an economy rate of 4.37 in six matches, with three three-wicket hauls against the United Arab Emirates , Bangladesh and Pakistan respectively. He also scored 64 runs at 32.00 including a 38 in a defeat against Pakistan. [8]
He then struggled during an ODI tour in Europe, taking three wickets at 78.00 at an economy rate of 5.48 from five matches. India won only one of these games and lost four. [8] Pathan returned to form during India's brief campaign at the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in England, where he claimed 5 wickets at an average of 9.00 and economy rate of 3.00. [20] [23] He took 2/11 against Kenya and 3/34 against Pakistan, but defeat at the hands of the latter ended India's campaign. [8]
Returning to India, Pathan then represented his country at the highest level for the first time on home soil. Pathan continued to improve his batting with a defiant 31 and 55 against Australia in October 2004 in the First Test in Bangalore . This was his first half-century in Tests, and was scored after the specialist batsmen had failed. Nevertheless, he managed a total of only 2/100 and India fell to a 217-run loss. Pathan's career was put on hold after he suffered a side strain in the following Test in Chennai , in which he totalled 0/68, causing him to miss the Tests in Nagpur and Mumbai . [24] [25] Australia went on to take the series 2–1 and Pathan ended with two wickets at 84.00 and 100 runs at 33.33. [8] After being overlooked for the First Test with selectors opting for three spinners, [26] he returned in the Second Test against South Africa in Kolkata , aggregating 3/89 and scoring 24 in an eight-wicket win that sealed a 1–0 series win. [8]
Pathan made his name in Tests on the December tour to Bangladesh . Swinging the ball both ways, Pathan took 5/45 and 6/51 including several LBW decisions in the First Test in Dhaka to claim his first ten-wicket haul and his first Test man of the match award as India claimed a commanding innings victory. [27] He followed this with a match haul of 7/118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11.88 to be named as man of the series. [14] [28] [29] India swept the series, winning both matches by an innings. Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily, Pathan managed only five and four. [8] He played in only one of the three ODIs against the hosts as India rotated their players, taking 1/45 and scoring 21 not out in an 11-run win. [8]
In late 2004, the Board of Control for Cricket in India introduced central contracts for international players for the first time, and Pathan was given a B-grade contract. 2005 began rather poorly for Pathan. He took only six wickets at 68.33 in the home Test series against Pakistan after losing pace and accuracy. [30] In the last two matches, he managed totals of 2/122 and 1/160, conceding more than four runs an over as the Pakistani batsmen scored heavily. He scored 64 runs at 16.00 and made a duck in the second innings of the Third Test as the hosts collapsed on the last day to squander the series 1–1. [8]
He was subsequently dropped for the ODI series, playing in only one match in which he conceded 67 runs without picking up a wicket in 8 overs. However, he did manage to post his first ODI half-century, scoring 64, defiantly holding up his end as India were bowled out for 213, sealing a 106-run loss. [16] Greg Chappell became the coach of the Indian team following the Pakistan series and identified Pathan as a potential all-rounder. He started to hone Pathan's batting skills, which had up to this point yielded 275 Test runs at 19.64. [28] Pathan was subsequently signed by Middlesex County Cricket Club for the English country season, where he attempted to regain his form after his bad start to the year. [31] Pathan arrived in late-May and stayed for six weeks. He achieved better results than in the Pakistan series, taking six wickets at 24.66 and an economy rate of 5.41 in four one-dayers, including 3/42 against Essex. In the new Twenty20 format, Pathan took 12 wickets at 12.75 and an economy rate of 6.37 in seven matches, including a best of 4/27 against Essex. He scored 21 not out in the same match to help seal a 31-run win. [8] However, his difficulties in first-class matches continued. He took 4/81 and 1/68, and scored 41 and 13 not out in a productive debut against Sussex , and Middlesex were only one wicket away from victory when time ran out. However, he failed to take another wicket and ended with five wickets at 64.80 and 126 runs at 63.00, scoring 68 against Surrey. [8]
Chappell era (2005–2007)[ edit ]
Pathan was recalled to the ODI team for the 2005 Indian Oil Cup in Sri Lanka in August. This was Chappell's first series as a coach, in which Pathan played in all five matches and took 6 wickets at 33.83 at an economy rate of 4.41, but conceded 0/59 from nine overs as the hosts won the final. He scored 58 runs at 29.00 including an unbeaten 36 after India's batting collapsed in a loss to the hosts in a preliminary match. [8]
Pathan bowling in the nets.
He showed further signs of returning to peak form in the Videocon Triangular Series in Zimbabwe , taking 10 wickets at 16.10 at an economy rate of 5.03 and scored 60 runs at 30.00 in four matches. This included a haul of 3/34 and then a score of 50 as India collapsed to 164 all out and a 51-run loss to New Zealand. In another match, he took his ODI career best of 5/27 against Zimbabwe in Harare as the hosts fell for 65. [16] [17] [20] Despite his overall good form, Pathan was punished by the New Zealanders in the final, conceding 40 runs in five wicketless overs as India lost their second successive final. [8] He was subsequently the leading wicket-taker as India took a 2–0 clean sweep of an away Test series against Zimbabwe . In the First Test in Bulawayo , Pathan took 5/58 and 4/53 as well as scoring 52 in a man of the match performance to help India to an innings victory. He followed this with a 7/59 haul, his Test career best innings haul, and 5/67 in the final Test in Harare , his second ten-wicket match haul to set up a ten wicket victory, having also scored 32 in the first innings. He was again named man of the match, and his 21 wickets at 11.29 runs saw him named man of the series. This made him only the third bowler after Anil Kumble and Johnny Briggs to take 21 wickets in a two-match series. [14] [28] [29] [32]
Upon the team's return to India, Chappell experimented with Pathan by using him as an opening batsman in the Challenger Trophy prior to the late 2005 series against Sri Lankan cricket team . This yielded only moderate success with scores of 28 and 11 not out. Pathan took six wickets at 29.16 at an economy rate of 5.17. [8] Pathan was subsequently used at No. 3 in the batting line-up in the First ODI against Sri Lanka in Nagpur , where he scored 83 runs from 70 balls to help India post a total of 6/350. [16] Pathan also took 4/37 and 3/38 in the second and seventh matches at Mohali and Baroda respectively to win two-man of the match awards, taking ten wickets at 25.60 at ane economy rate of 5.22 for the whole series. [20] He added a 35 in the final match and ended the series with 118 runs at 39.33, playing akey role in India's 6–1 triumph. [8] Pathan continued his strong ODI form with another man of the match performance of 3/23 and a knock of 37 runs against South Africa in the second ODI in Bangalore , [17] having scored 46 in the middle-order in the first match after a top=order collapse. He ended the series with six wickets at 20.33 at an economy rate of 4.69 and 83 runs at 27.66. [8]
After scoring two consecutive ducks in the Test series against Sri Lanka, Pathan was elevated to opening in the second innings of the Second Test in Delhi , after regular opener Virender Sehwag was down with illness. Having taken 3/34 from 22 overs in the first innings, Pathan scored 93 runs, building on a first innings lead of 60 to help set up a winning target of 436. In the following match in Ahmedabad , he scored 82 runs and combined in a century stand with V. V. S. Laxman to revive India after an early batting collapse saw five wickets fall during the first half of the opening day. He also took seven wickets at an average of 26.00 runs in the series, which India won 2–0. [14] [28] Pathan later admitted that he had been disappointed in failing to score a Test century. [33] Following his strong performances in 2005, Pathan was promoted in December to an A-grade contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India . [34]
Pathan had another difficult start to the new year in 2006 on the Test tour to Pakistan. In the first two Test matches played on flat surfaces in Lahore and Faisalabad , he had little success against the Pakistani batsmen, taking a total of two wickets while conceding 319 runs at more than four runs an over. After not getting and opportunity in the First Test—India lost only one wicket—Pathan made use of the good batting conditions himself and scored 90 in a double century partnership with wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Faisalabad . Pathan found success with the ball in the Third Test in Karachi , when on 29 January, he became the first person to claim a hat-trick in the first over of a Test match—the first five minutes of a match scheduled for 30 hours—and the first Indian to take a hat-trick in an away Test. It was also the highest in terms of total averages of the batsmen dismissed (130.18: Salman Butt 34.27, Younis Khan 46.04, Mohammad Yousuf 49.86) and came after 1783 Tests in the history of cricket. [14] [35] He had Butt caught by Dravid in the slips from an outswinger, before trapping Younis leg before wicket and bowling Yousuf, both with inswingers. He finished with a haul of 5/61 after the hosts staged a lower-order counter-attack but was punished in the second innings, taking 1 wicket while conceding 106 runs as Pakistan set a target which was beyond India's reach. [14] Pathan ended the series with 134 runs at 44.66 and took eight wickets at 60.75. [8] Despite his Test travails, Pathan continued to perform strongly in the ODI arena, scoring 65 in the top order in the first ODI against Pakistan in Peshawar before making three consecutive three wicket hauls in the following matches. This included a man of the match performance that included a haul of 3 wickets for 43 runs at Rawalpindi as he claimed nine wickets at 18.88 at an economy rate of 4.49 for the series. [16] [17] [20] Having taken an unassailable 3–1 lead, India rested Pathan for the final match.
Pathan had a quiet series against England following his return to India, taking 8 wickets at an average of 39.37 runs and scoring 121 runs at an average of 24.20 runs in three Tests. [28] Pathan scored 52 in the first innings of the Second Test in Mohali, helping India to a first-innings lead and eventually a nine-wicket win. [8] In the Third Test, Pathan managed only 1/84 in total and scored 26 and 6 as they collapsed on the final day and ceded their series lead. [8] Again his ODI form was unaffected, taking eleven wickets at 15.63 in five matches, and scoring 123 runs at 41.00 with the bat as India easily claimed the series 5–1. [16] [20] Pathan scored 28 and then took 3/21 in a low-scoring 29-win in the first match, before scoring 36 and taking 4/51 in the third match in Goa. India then took an unassailable 4–0 lead by winning the fourth match, in which Pathan took 1/27 before scoring 46 in the run-chase. [8]
International omission[ edit ]
Pathan began to suffer a loss of form during the tour of the West Indies in May 2006, when he managed only 24 runs at 6.00 and took 6 wickets at 29.83 at an economy rate of 5.59 while bowling in the ODI arena as India lost the series 4–1. After a poor display in a tour match, in which he was hit for 70 runs in 12 overs and appeared jaded, he was dropped from the Test team as V. R. V. Singh became the third place bowler and captain Rahul Dravid scrapped the five bowler strategy. Pathan only played once in the Second Test, after Sreesanth was sidelined due to injury. He scored 19 and took 1/43 and 1/50 as India enforced the follow on but the hosts hung on for a draw with three wickets in hand. India then selected two spinners in the last two Tests, and Pathan could not gain one of the two pace positions. Chappell stated that Pathan was fatigued and had been overworked but was confident that Pathan "would recover from his slump and rise to further heights", asserting that he was still young and learning. [36] Former India paceman Javagal Srinath expressed concern about Pathan's dwindling pace, but expressed that swing was the first priority in backing Pathan's return to international cricket. [37]
These concerns were further magnified in late 2006, when Pathan conceded 54 runs in six overs in the first two matches of a triangular ODI tournament in Malaysia. Despite scoring 64 in the top-order in the first of these matches against the West Indies, [8] Pathan was dropped for the rest of the tournament. He appeared to have run into some form during the Challenger Trophy when he took five wickets at 15.80 at an economy rate of 4.64 and scored 95 runs at 31.66 in three matches. [8]
Pathan was then demoted from the position of an opening bowler in ODIs during the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy ; he took four wickets at 24.00 at an economy rate of 4.80, and scored only 29 runs at 9.66, [8] as India were knocked out in the first round. Pathan was then limited to sporadic ODI appearances on the late-2006 tour to South Africa. [16] [20] Playing in three of the five matches, he took a solitary wicket at 136.00, conceding 7.15 runs per over, the only bright spot being an unbeaten 47 as India were skittled for 163 in one match; they were whitewashed by the hosts. [8]
Since the West Indies tour in May 2006, Pathan had only been taking wickets at 41.33. He subsequently fell out of the Top 10 of the ICC bowling rankings and the Top 5 of the All rounder rankings after having spent the previous year on the list. Despite this, Indian captain Rahul Dravid remained optimistic about Pathan's prospects, stating "The number of Man-of-the-Matches that Irfan has won is a testimony to the fact that he's a proven matchwinner for us. He takes wickets early, contributes with the bat, is good in the field." [38] Despite top scoring in both innings of a first-class warm-up match in Potchefstroom , scoring 111 not out and 40 not out whilst many specialist batsmen failed to cope with the bouncy conditions, he totalled only 1/49 from eight overs with the ball [8] and was overlooked by the selectors for the First Test in Johannesburg . This indicated that although he had scored 560 runs at 35.00 under Chappell's coaching, they saw bowling, which had been steadily declining, as his primary responsibility. [39] [40] After a poor bowling display in the subsequent tour match in which he conceded 74 runs in only 11 overs, Pathan became the first player to be sent home by the BCCI during a tour for poor performance rather than indiscipline. It was later revealed by Kiran More that it was a mutual agreement so that Pathan could play for Baroda in the final two rounds of Ranji Trophy in an attempt to regain form via match practice instead of watching the final two Tests from the sidelines. [41] [42] He subsequently led Baroda to the semi-finals after scoring 82* to help defeat Uttar Pradesh by five wickets, but his bowling remained ineffective, returning figures of 2/108 and 1/59, conceding 4.77 runs per over. [42] Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar attributed Pathan's situation to mismanagement, asserting that Pathan has been "messed about" as well as insinuating foul play. [43] Pathan's fortunes improved in the next two matches, totalling 5/92 and 7/96 against Tamil Nadu and Mumbai respectively.
Pathan was initially dropped for the ODI series hosted by India against the West Indies, but was recalled for the final match in his home town after claiming seven wickets against Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy semi-final. [44] His performance was regarded as lacklustre, taking 1/43 from seven overs. [16] [45] The selectors persisted and named him in the squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup , [46] but injury stopped him from playing in the ODI series against Sri Lanka, denying him an opportunity to regain form. [16] [47] Pathan on his return took two wickets of the overs which he bowled.He had an impressive start as he took the wicket of Lendle Simons as a Leg Before Wicket.
After taking 1/12 and 3/25 in warm-up matches against the Netherlands and the West Indies in the Caribbean, Pathan did not play a match at the World Cup, [16] and was among a group of players to be dropped from the squad following India's exit from the first round. [48] He played no part in the tours of Bangladesh and England. [49] [50] Instead, he was sent on an India A tour of Africa. [51] Two years after devastating the Zimbabwean batsmen, he played against a Zimbabwe Select XI, he took only six wickets at 30.16 in two matches, and then took eight wickets at 18.12 in two matches against Kenya. India won all four matches, and Pathan scored 87 runs at 21.75. [8] Pathan then took six wickets at 23.83 and scored 93 runs at 31.00 in four one-dayers. [8]
International comeback[ edit ]
With India's older players opting out of the inaugural World Twenty20 , Pathan was one of several younger players to regain national selection. India were not expected to do well in a format that favoured stronger fielding sides. [52] In the first match, he scored 20 and took 2/20 in four overs as India tied with Pakistan in the first round, before winning in a bowl-out. He then took 0/16 from two chamatkar as India lost to New Zealand before taking 3/37 in a defeat of England. India needed a win over hosts South Africa to reach the semi-final and Pathan conceded only 16 runs from his four overs, helping to restrict the hosts to 9/116 in pursuit of 154. Pathan then took 2/44, removing Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds as India managed to defend 188 for a 15-run win to reach the finals. India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. Pathan was declared the Man of the match after bowling a tidy spell and taking 3/16, including the removal of Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and then the big-hitting Shahid Afridi for a duck in the space of three balls, before later bowling Yasir Arafat . [53]
As a result of his performances in South Africa, Pathan was recalled to the ODI team and played in the home series against Australia and Pakistan in late 2007. He played in all 12 matches, seven against Australia and five against Pakistan. Pathan scored 131 runs at 18.71 in the lower-order and took 12 wickets at 46.00 at an economy rate of 5.02, averaging substantially worse than his overall career statistics. [20] It was a steady performance; Pathan never took more than two wickets in any match and his economy rate was always between 4.60 and 6.66 and scored 26 and 29 in consecutive matches in Baroda and Rajkot against Australia before making 43 in the final match against Pakistan. [8]
With India opting to field two spinners and two pacemen on turning tracks in the home Test series against Pakistan in late 2007, Pathan missed the first two Tests as Zaheer and Rudra Pratap Singh were the fast bowlers chosen. In the meantime, he took 11 wickets at 23.81 and scored 90 runs at 30.00 in two Ranji Trophy matches. Injury to both Zaheer and Singh in his colleagues resulted in his recall for the Third Test at Bangalore. Pathan scored his maiden Test century, reaching the mark with a six from leg spinner Danish Kaneria to move from 96 to 102 with only last man, paceman Ishant Sharma left to accompany him, before holing out in the same over. [54] [55] [56] He made 21 not out in the second innings but was unpenetrative with the ball, taking a total of 1/110 as the tourists hung on for a draw. [8]
Pathan gained selection for the 2007–08 tour of Australia, but did not play in the first two Tests with only two pacemen chosen. Zaheer and Singh were the first-choice pace duo before the former was injured and replaced by Ishant, who had taken five wickets in the first innings of the Bangalore Test. With the Third Test held on the bouncy WACA Ground in Perth , [57] Pathan replaced second spinner Harbhajan Singh . [58] [59] He batted well with scores of 28 and 46 respectively. His second innings performance came as a nightwatchman in order to shield other batsmen from the new ball late in the second day. After entering at the fall of the first wicket, he batted for more than two hours and was the sixth man to fall. Pathan rediscovered his ability to swing the ball, [58] taking 2/63 and 3/54, including both Australian openers in each innings, having the hosts two wickets down in both innings before 50 runs had been scored. He had four of his victims caught behind the wicket off an edge and trapped Chris Rogers lbw. India won by 72 runs and Pathan was recognised with the man of the match award. [14] [28] [29] [60]
After his batting displays in Perth, Pathan was promoted to open the batting in the Fourth Test in Adelaide, replacing the struggling Wasim Jaffer and thereby allowing Harbhajan to return in a five-bowler attack. In a high-scoring match, Pathan took 3/112, but he struggled with the responsibility of opening, scoring nine and a duck. [14] [28] In a high-scoring match, he took 3/112 in Australia's 563.Following the Test series, he top-scored with 26 as India were skittles for 74 in the one-off T20 international. Pathan held his place in the ODI team and played all 10 matches in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy, scoring 118 runs at 19.66 mostly in the lower order and taking 11 wickets at 34.27 at an economy rate of 5.49. [20] His best performance was a 4/41 against Australia at Adelaide to help restrict the hosts to 203 but India then collapsed to a 50-run loss. [16] His top-score of 31 in the series came in partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the closing stages of a successful and tense run-chase against Sri Lanka. Pathan struggled in the two finals against Australia, taking three wickets at 39.00 at an economy rate of 7.46 but his teammates did enough to ensure a 2–0 win. [8] An extra bowler backfired as the batsmen struggled. Pathan top-scored with 21* in India's first innings of 76 on the first morning and was again unbeaten in the second innings with 43. However, he failed to take a wicket and conceded 85 runs in only 21.2 overs in an innings defeat, and was omitted from the next Test. [14] After the South Africa series, Pathan participated in the 2008 Indian Premier League , having been purchased by the Kings XI Punjab .
He took 15 wickets at 23.33 at the economy rate of 6.60 runs per over. [61] His most effective performance came when he added an unbeaten 24 and took 2/18 from his four overs to help Punjab to a nine-run win over the Kolkata Knight Riders . He scored 131 runs at 21.83 and added 40 in a failed run-chase against Chennai Super Kings . [8]
Back on the fringes[ edit ]
Following the IPL, Pathan resumed international duties in the Kitply Cup and the 2008 Asia Cup . He had an unproductive time with the ball; although he scored a total of 86 runs at 28.66, he took seven wickets at 51.42 at an economy rate of 6.56. [20] Pathan was overlooked for the Tests in Sri Lanka but was called into the team for the one-dayers, but played in only three of the five fixtures. He took three wickets at 34.66, conceding 5.20 runs an over, and struggled with the bat, scoring 19 runs at 6.33 as the Indian batting collapsed in each match. [8] He was then included in an India A team for a series of matches against touring counterparts from New Zealand and Australia. He had average results, taking four wickets at 43.75 and an economy rate of 4.86, and scored 56 runs at 18.66 in four games. [8] He did better the Challenger Trophy, taking six wickets at 14.00 at an economy rate of 3.42, and scored 71 runs at 35.50 as India Blue won all three matches. [8]
At the start of the first-class season, Pathan scored 56 but took a total of only 1/91 for the Board President's XI against the touring Australians ahead of the Test series, and he was overlooked for Test selection as India used only two pacemen. He returned to play for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy. [8] He played in four matches and performed strongly, taking 26 wickets at 16.03 and scored 166 runs at 33.20. He started the season with 6/85 and 1/34 in a draw against Uttar Pradesh, and then took 4/42 and 1/46 against Railways. He then put on an all-round display to guide his team to a victory over Maharashtra. Pathan took 5/64 and then scored 51 as Baroda made 305 in their first innings to take a 77-run lead. After taking 1/61 in the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 50 to guide Baroda to their target of 227 with four wickets in hand. In his final Ranji fixture for the season, he took 7/35 in the first innings to help dismiss Andhra Pradesh for 77, setting up an innings win. [8] However, with India persisting with and tasting success with their Test bowling strategy, Pathan was also overlooked for the home Tests against England. Pathan's domestic season was interrupted by spasmodic limited overs duty. Following his recent uneconomical run in ODIs, he was not given a game in the seven-match series against England in November until India had taken an unassailable 4–0 series lead. He took 0/57 from ten overs in the fifth match, as India recorded another victory, but did not get another opportunity after the Mumbai terrorist attacks saw the two remaining fixtures cancelled. Pathan was then selected for the early-2009 five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka, but was not entrusted with a match until India took an unbeatable 3–0 lead. He took four wickets at 28.25 in two matches, but was again expensive, conceding 7.06 runs an over. [8] However, he ended the tour on a high note when he combined with half-brother Yusuf in an unbroken eighth-wicket stand that saw India to a three-wicket win in the T20 international after a late flurry; Irfan ended on 33 not out. [8] Pathan returned to India and took 3/50 and scored 51 not out in his only domestic one-dayer for Baroda during the season, which ended in a win, before leaving for the limited overs leg of a tour to New Zealand. [8]
Pathan had a poor time in New Zealand. In the two T20 internationals preceding the ODIs, he took 0/38 and 2/41, conceding his runs at an alarming economy rate of 11.28. He was left out of all five ODIs during the tour before heading home. [8] He then played in all 14 of Punjab's round-robin matches in the 2009 Indian Premier League held in South Africa, taking 17 wickets at 22.94 with an economy rate of 7.74, and scored 196 runs at 19.60. He started strongly, taking nine wickets in four matches in the early stages of the tournament, before taking only two in the next five matches, and ending with six in the last three fixtures. Punjab failed to make the semi-finals. [8]
Pathan's performances in the IPL were enough for him to retain his position in the national T20 team after his performances in New Zealand, and he then proceeded to the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England in June, where India were seeking to defend their title. He struggled in the warm-up matches, totalling 1/49 in five overs, and again in the first round of matches, bowling five overs and conceding 42 runs without success. Nevertheless, India d was acquitted in the spot-fixing case. [38]
Official warnings
Sreesanth is noted for his exuberant and emotional behaviour, especially whilst appealing for and celebrating wickets. He has been warned several times for indiscipline both on and off the cricket field, and frequently fined for violating the player conduct guidelines of the International Cricket Council . In October 2009, the BCCI issued a final warning to Sreesanth that any repetition of his code of conduct violations might result in drastic actions such as a ban from domestic cricket. [39] Subsequently, the Kerala Cricket Association also issued a final warning over repeated violations of their code of conduct after Sreesanth failed to turn up at the Kerala Ranji Trophy team camp in Kannur . [40]
In November 2009, however, after more than 18 months of omission from the national team, Sreesanth was recalled to the Test squad for the first two matches against Sri Lanka. [41] He replaced Ishant Sharma for the second Test in Kanpur, where his five wicket haul in the first innings of the match earned him the Man of the Match award and helped India to win the Test match by an innings and 144 runs. [23]
Name
Correct name
In the English-language media, Sreesanth's full name has been the source of some confusion. He has been variously referred to as "Sree Sreesanth", [42] "Sri Sreesanth", [43] "Shantha Sreesanth". [44] and "Shanthakumaran Sreesanth". [45] He has also stated in the past that he wished to be known as "Sree Santh". [46] In September 2007, Sreesanth said that his name was just "Sreesanth" and that the other variations were incorrect:
"It's Sreesanth. There is no Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, there is no S. Sreesanth. There was this function recently where they called me Sree Sreesanth, then Sree, and finally S Sreesanth. It's just Sreesanth." [47]
Decision and cancellation of name change
When his form slumped in 2006, Sreesanth had tried to change his luck by changing his name to Sreesunth, on numerological advice. He later stated that he was not going to change the name due to sentimental reasons. The word 'santh' in his name is derived from his father's name Santhakumaran Nair. [48]

Early life
Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi in a Punjabi family. [7] [8] His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a housewife. [9] He has an elder brother, Vikash, and an elder sister, Bhavna. [10] According to his family, when he was three-years old, Kohli would pick up a cricket bat , start swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him. [11]
Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar [12] and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School. In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created, and Kohli, a nine-year-old, was part of its first intake. [12] Kohli's father took him to the academy after their neighbors suggested that "Virat shouldn't waste his time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club". [9] Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma and also played matches at the Sumit Dogra Academy near Noida at the same time. [12] In ninth grade, he shifted to Savier Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice. [9] Apart from sports, Kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as "a bright and alert child". [13]
Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to brain stroke after being bed-ridden for a month. [9] Regarding his early life, Kohli has said in an interview, "I've seen a lot in life. Losing my father at a young age, the family business not doing too well, staying in a rented place. There were tough times for the family... It's all embedded in my memory." [14] According to Kohli, his father supported his cricket training during his childhood, "My father was my biggest support. He was the one who drove me to practice everyday. I miss his presence sometimes." [15]
Youth and domestic career
Kohli first played for Delhi Under-15 team in October 2002 in the 2002–03 Polly Umrigar Trophy. He was the leading run-getter for his team in that tournament with 172 runs at an average of 34.40.

He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s [22] and 49 in the three-match Test series. [23] India Under-19 went on to win both the series. At the conclusion of the tour, the India Under-19 coach Lalchand Rajput was impressed with Kohli and said, "Kohli showed strong technical skills against both pace and spin". [24] In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. Kohli averaged 58 in the Test series [25] and 41.66 in the ODI series against Pakistan Under-19s .

He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90. [31] He went directly to the funeral after he was dismissed. Delhi captain Mithun Manhas said, "That is an act of great commitment to the team and his innings turned out to be crucial. Hats off to his attitude and determination." [32] His mother noted that "Virat changed a bit after that day. Overnight he became a much more matured person. He took every match seriously. He hated being on the bench. It's as if his life hinged totally on cricket after that day. Now, he looked like he was chasing his father's dream which was his own too." [9] He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 36.71 in that season. [33]

In February–March 2008, Kohli captained the victorious Indian team at the 2008 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia . Batting at number 4, he scored 235 runs in 6 matches at an average of 47, and finished as the tournament's third highest run-getter and one of the three batsmen to score a hundred in the tournament. [37] His century (100 runs from 74 balls) against the West Indies Under-19s in the group stage, which was called "the innings of the tournament" by ESPNcricinfo , [38] gave India a 50-run victory and earned Kohli the man of the match. Kohli picked up a leg injury during the match, but recovered in time to play the quarterfinal match against England Under-19s. [39] He was instrumental in India's three-wicket semifinal win over New Zealand Under-19s in which he took 2/27 and scored 43 in the tense run-chase and was awarded the man of the match. [40] [41] He scored 19 against South Africa Under-19s in the final which India won by 12 runs ( D/L method ). ESPNcricinfo commended him for making several tactical bowling changes during the tournament. [38]
Following the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was bought by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000 on a youth contract . [42] In June 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. The scholarship allowed the three players to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia 's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.

— Kohli on his selection to the Indian team for the Sri Lankan tour. [30]
In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches, [45] and his selection was called a "surprise call-up". [46] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series. He made his international debut in the first ODI of the tour and was dismissed for 12. [47] He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match which helped India win the series. [48] He had scores of 37, 25 and 31 in the other three matches. [49] India won the series 3–2 which was India's first ODI series win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.
After the Champions Trophy was postponed to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008. [50] He batted only once in the two-match series, and scored 49 in that innings. [51] Later that month, he played for Delhi in the Nissar Trophy against SNGPL and top-scored for Delhi in both innings, with 52 and 197. The match was drawn but SNGPL won the trophy on first-innings lead. [52] In October 2008, Kohli played for Indian Board President's XI in a four-day tour match against Australia. He made 105 and 16* in that match against a bowling lineup consisting of Brett Lee , Stuart Clark , Mitchell Johnson , Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza . [53]
Kohli was included in the squad for the home ODI series against England in November 2008 but was not given a chance to play, due to the inclusion of Tendulkar and Sehwag in team. [54] In December 2008, Kohli was given a Grade D contract in the annual BCCI contracts list which entitled him to receive Rs 15 lakh. [55] He was then dropped from the squad for the five-match ODI series in Sri Lanka against Sri Lanka in January 2009.
"That boosted my confidence tremendously. I just became so much more mentally stronger. I have now learned to bat in pressure conditions. From that time, I have just been concentrating on my game and not thinking about other things. I am very focused now."

— Kohli on his performance in the Emerging Players Tournament. [56]
Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in July–August 2009 held in Australia. He opened the innings for India Emerging Players in that tournament and finished as the leading run-getter with 398 runs from seven matches at an average of 66.33. [57] He scored 104 off 102 balls in the final against South Africa Emerging Players at Brisbane to help his team win the match by 17 runs and clinch the title. [58] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth , the chairman of the national selection committee , was impressed with Kohli and remarked "I must say, opener Virat Kohli was outstanding. Some of the shots he played spoke about his ability." [59] Kohli has called this tournament as the "turning point" of his career. [56]
Kohli then replaced the injured Gambhir in Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka . [60] Kohli batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of the injury to Yuvraj Singh . In the inconsequential group match against the West Indies , Kohli scored an unbeaten 79 in India's successful chase of 130 and won his first man of the match award. [61] Kohli played as a reserve batsman in the seven-match home ODI series against Australia , appearing in two matches as a replacement for the injured players Yuvraj and Gambhir. Kohli found a place in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009. He scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely. [62] Kohli returned to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 111 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir who made his personal best score of 150. India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1. [63] The man of the match was awarded to Gambhir who gave the award to Kohli. [64]
Rise through the ranks
Tendulkar was rested for the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in January 2010 which enabled Kohli to play in each of India's five matches. After making nine in the opening loss to Sri Lanka, he scored 91 to help secure a win after India collapsed to 51/3 early in their run-chase of 297 against Bangladesh on 7 January 2010. [65] In the next match against Sri Lanka, Kohli ended unbeaten on 71 to help India win the match with a bonus point after they chased down their target of 214 in the 33rd over. The next day, he scored his second ODI century, against Bangladesh, bringing up the mark with the winning runs. [66] He became only the third Indian batsman to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd birthday, after Tendulkar and Suresh Raina . [67] Kohli was much praised for his performances during the series [56] [68] in particular by the Indian captain Dhoni. [69] Although Kohli made only two runs in the final against Sri Lanka in a four-wicket Indian defeat, [70] he finished as the leading run-getter of the series with 275 runs from five innings at an average of 91.66. [71] In the three-match ODI series at home against South Africa in February, Kohli batted in two games and had scores of 31 and 57.
Raina was named captain and Kohli vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe in May–June 2010, as many first-choice players skipped the tour. India lost thrice in four matches, including two defeats at the hands of Zimbabwe , and crashed out of the series. Kohli made 168 runs at 42.00 including two fifties in the series. [72] During the series, he became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket. [73] Kohli was also part of the Indian squad for the T20I series against Zimbabwe that followed the tri-series which India won 2–0. He made his T20I debut in the first match at Harare where India were reduced to 48/4 in the eighth over, chasing 112. Kohli scored an unbeaten 26 and put on an unbroken 64-run fifth-wicket partnership with Yusuf Pathan to guide India to their first win over Zimbabwe in the tour. [74] Later that same month, India chose a full-strength squad for the 2010 Asia Cup with Dhoni as captain and Sehwag vice-captain. Kohli batted at 3 throughout the tournament and scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75. [75] His struggles with form continued in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where he averaged 15.

Despite the poor run of form, Kohli was retained in the ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October. The first and third matches of the series were washed out and in the second match at Visakhapatnam, Kohli scored his third ODI century–118 off 121 balls–which helped India chase down the target of 290 after losing the openers early. [76] He won the man of the match and admitted that he was under pressure to keep his place in the team after failures in the two previous series. [77] In late-2010, Gambhir was named captain of a largely inexperienced ODI squad to play against New Zealand , and Kohli maintained his place. [78] In the first ODI at Guwahati, Kohli scored a 104-ball 105, his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession, in a 40-run victory and was awarded man of the match. [79] In the second and third ODIs, he made 64 and 63* respectively, sharing 100-plus partnerships with Gambhir in both matches chasing. [80] [81] India completed a 5–0 whitewash of New Zealand, while Kohli's performance in the series helped him become a regular in the ODI team [82] and made him a strong contender for a spot in India's World Cup squad. [83] He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, with 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38 including three centuries. [84]
Kohli played in the one-match T20I series and all five ODIs of the South African tour in January 2011. India won the T20I in which he scored 28, [85] but lost the ODI series 2–3, [86] in which he finished as India's leading run-getter with 193 runs at an average of 48.25 including two fifties, both in Indian defeats. [87] During the ODI series, India announced their 15-man squad for the World Cup in which Kohli was also named. [88] Kohli also reached the number two spot on the ICC Rankings for ODI batsmen during the series. [89]
World Cup, England and West Indies
The inclusion of both Kohli and Raina in the World Cup squad resulted in speculations about which of the two batsmen will make it to the playing eleven. Days before India's first match of the tournament, Indian captain Dhoni indicated that the in-form Kohli is likely to be preferred over Raina. [89] Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100, his fifth ODI century, in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut. [90] In the next four group matches he had low scores of 8, 34, 12 and 1 against England, Ireland , Netherlands and South Africa respectively. He returned to form against West Indies scoring 59 and sharing a 122-run third-wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh. [91] Against Australia in the quarterfinals, he scored 24, [92] and was dismissed for 9 in the semifinal against Pakistan. [93] India won both matches and progressed to the finals against Sri Lanka at Mumbai. In the final , he scored 35 and shared an 83-run partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within the seventh over chasing 275. [94] The partnership is regarded as "one of the turning points in the match". [95] India went on to win the match by six wickets and lift the World Cup for the first time since 1983. [96]

When India toured the West Indies in June–July 2011, they chose a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar and others such as Gambhir and Sehwag missing out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad. [97] Kohli found success in the ODI series which India won 3–2, with a total of 199 runs at an average of 39.80. [98] His best efforts came in the second ODI at Port of Spain where he won the man of the match for his score of 81 which gave India a seven-wicket victory, [99] and the fifth ODI at Kingston where his innings of 94 came in a seven-wicket defeat. [100] Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at five and was dismissed for 4 and 15 caught behind by Fidel Edwards in both innings. [101] India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli struggled throughout the series amassing just 76 runs from five innings. [102] He struggled against the short ball [103] and was particularly troubled by the fast bowling of Edwards, who dismissed him three times in the series. [104]
Initially dropped from the Test squad for India's four-match series in England in July and August, Kohli was recalled as replacement for the injured Yuvraj, [105] though did not play in any match in the series. He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80. [106] His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street [107] was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches. In the last game of the series, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared a 170-run third-wicket partnership with Rahul Dravid , who was playing his last ODI, to help India post their first 300-plus total of the tour. [108] Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings which was the only century in the series by any player on either team and earned him praise for his "hard work" and "maturity". [109] However, England won the match by D/L method and the series 3–0. [110]
In October 2011, Kohli was the leading run-scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0. He scored a total of 270 runs across five matches including unbeaten knocks of 112 from 98 balls at Delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209-run partnership with Gambhir, [111] and 86 at Mumbai, both in successful run-chases. [112] Following this ODI success, Kohli was included, ahead of Raina, in the Test squad to face the West Indies in November. In competition with Yuvraj Singh for the number six position, [113] it was not until the final match of the series that Kohli was selected in the team. [114] He scored a pair of fifties in the match, passing his previous highest Test score of 30, [115] and his knock of 52 in the first innings ensured India avoided follow-on . [116] The match ended in a draw, and having won the first two Tests, India took the series 2–0. India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75. [117] During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run-chase of 271, [118] [119] a knock which raised his reputation as "an expert of the chase". [120] Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 and four centuries. [121]
2011/12–2014: ODI vice-captain and success
Australian tour and ascension to vice-captaincy
Kohli was selected in India's Test squad for the tour of Australia in December 2011. The exclusion of Yuvraj from the Test squad meant that the number six position was a competition between Kohli and Rohit Sharma , who was yet to make his Test debut. [122] Kohli top-scored with 132 in a tour match against Cricket Australia Chairman's XI and strengthened his case for a spot in the Boxing Day Test . [123] Kohli was picked for the first Test at Melbourne, but his defensive technique was exposed in the match [124] as he was dismissed for 11 in the first innings and a first-ball duck in the second, by Ben Hilfenhaus on both occasions. [125] He struggled in the second Test at Sydney as well with scores of 24 and 9. While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the match, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fees by the match referee . Kohli responded to the incident on Twitter by posting: "i agree cricketers dont have to retaliate. what when the crowd says the worst things about your mother and sister. the worst ive heard" (sic). [126] Kohli top-scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth, with 44 and 75, even as India surrendered to their second consecutive innings defeat. [127] In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings; it was the only century scored by an Indian in the series. [128] India lost the series 4–0 [129] and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series, was described as "the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists". [130]
Following the Test series, India remained in Australia for a two match T20I series and the Commonwealth Bank triangular series featuring Australia and Sri Lanka apart from India. Kohli scored 22 and 31 in the T20I series that ended in a 1–1 draw. In the tri-series, Kohli top-scored with 31 in India's opening loss to Australia, [131] before scoring 77 at Perth in the next match against Sri Lanka in a four-wicket win. [132] In the next five matches, he had scores of 18, 15, 12, 66 and 21. Two wins and a tie in seven matches meant that India needed a bonus point win their last group match against Sri Lanka at Hobart to stay in contention for qualifying for the finals series. [133] Chasing 321 to win, Kohli came to the crease with India's score at 86/2 and went on to score 133 not out from 86 balls to take India to a comfortable win with 13 overs to spare. [134] India earned a bonus point with the win and Kohli was named Man of the Match for his effort, which included scoring 24 runs in an over by Lasith Malinga . [135] Former Australian cricketer and commentator, Dean Jones said that Kohli's innings "is up there with one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time". [136] However, Sri Lanka beat Australia three days later in their last group fixture and knocked India out of the series. [137] With 373 runs at 53.28, Kohli once again scored the only hundred by an Indian batsman and finished as India's highest run-scorer of the series. [138]
Kohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh on the back of his fine performance in Australia. Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of selectors, told reporters, "Hats off to Virat Kohli for the way he played. We have to start looking towards the future. The selection committee and the Board felt Kohli is future captaincy material." [139] Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119. [140] He scored 108 in the opening match against Sri Lanka in a 50-run Indian victory, [141] while India lost their next match to Bangladesh in which he made 66. [142] In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored a personal best 183 off 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. Coming in at 0/1, he struck 22 fours and a six in his innings to take India to a record chase of 330. [143] [144] His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history, the joint-second highest score in an ODI run-chase and the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs surpassing previous record of 156 by Brian Lara . [145] Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both matches that India won, but India could not progress to the final of the tournament.
In July–August 2012, Kohli struck two centuries in the five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka –106 off 113 balls at Hambantota and 128* off 119 balls at Colombo–winning man of the match in both games. [146] [147] India won the series 4–1 and on account of scoring the most number of runs in the series, Kohli was named player of the series. [148] In the one-off T20I that followed, he scored a 48-ball 68, his first T20I fifty, and won the player of the series award. [149] Kohli scored his second Test century at Bangalore during New Zealand's tour of India and won his first man of the match award in Test cricket. [150] India won the two-match series 2–0, and Kohli averaged 106 with one hundred and two fifties from three innings. [151] In the subsequent T20I series, he scored 70 runs off 41 balls, but India lost the match by one run and the series 1–0. [152] He continued to be in good form during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, with 185 runs from 5 matches at an average of 46.25. [153] He hit two fifties during the tournament, 50 against Afghanistan in the group stage [154] and 78* against Pakistan in the Super Eights, winning man of the match for both innings. [155]
Kohli's Test form dipped during the first three matches of England's tour of India with a top score of 20 and England leading the series 2–1. He scored a patient 103 from 295 balls in the last match on a slow and low pitch at Nagpur, [156] keeping India in contention of drawing the series. ESPNcricinfo praised Kohli for having "demonstrated his growing maturity to play just the sort of innings his side required", [157] while Kohli described his knock as "a learning innings". [158] However, the match ended in a draw and England won their first Test series in India in 28 years. [159] India drew the following T20I series 1–1 in which Kohli had scores of 21 and 38. Before the five-match ODI series against England in January 2013, India hosted Pakistan for two T20Is and three ODIs. The T20I series was drawn 1–1 and Pakistan won the ODI series 2–1. Kohli struggled in both series, averaging 18 in the T20Is [160] and 4.33 in the ODIs. [161] Kohli was troubled by the fast bowlers, particularly Junaid Khan , who dismissed him on all three occasions in the ODI series. [162] Kohli had a quiet ODI series against England, apart from a match-winning 77* in the third ODI at Ranchi, [163] with a total of 155 runs at an average of 38.75. [164]
"I love watching Virat Kohli bat. He looks to me like an individual of my own heart. I love his aggression, and [he has] serious passion that I used to have. He reminds me of myself."

Kohli scored his fourth Test century (107) at Chennai in the first match of the home Test series against Australia in February 2013. He said he was "feeling hungry for this series" after a poor run of form in the two previous series and also disappointed on getting out soon after reaching the hundred-run mark. [166] India completed a 4–0 series sweep, becoming the first team to whitewash Australia in more than four decades. [167] Kohli averaged 56.80 in the series and cemented his spot in the Test team. [168]
Maiden captaincy stint and setting records

In June 2013, Kohli featured in the ICC Champions Trophy in England which India won. He scored a match-winning 144 against Sri Lanka in a warm-up match. [169] He was dismissed for 34 in India's opening match of the tournament against South Africa, trying to pull a short ball from Lonwabo Tsotsobe , [170] and 22 in the next match against the West Indies by Sunil Narine . [171] He remained unbeaten at 22 in India's final group match against Pakistan, while India qualified for the semifinals with an undefeated record. [172] In the semifinal against Sri Lanka at Cardiff, he struck 58 not out in an eight-wicket win for India. [173] The final between India and England at Birmingham was reduced to 20 overs after a rain delay. India batted first and Kohli top-scored with 43 from 34 balls, sharing a vital sixth-wicket partnership of 47 runs off 33 balls with Ravindra Jadeja , to help India reach 129/7 in 20 overs. India went on to secure a five-run win and their second consecutive ICC ODI tournament victory. [174]
Kohli stood-in as the captain for the first ODI of the triangular series in West Indies after Dhoni injured himself during the match. India lost the match by one wicket, and Dhoni was subsequently ruled out of the series with Kohli being named captain for the remaining matches. [175] In his second match as captain, Kohli scored his first hundred as captain, making 102 off 83 balls against the West Indies at Port of Spain in a bonus point win for India. [176] India earned another bonus point win in their next match against Sri Lanka and, having topped the points table, qualified for the final against the same opposition. [177] Dhoni recovered from his injury before the final and returned to the team as captain. Kohli was dismissed for 2 in that match, but India went on to register a one-wicket victory. [178] Many senior players including Dhoni were rested for the five-match ODI tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013, with Kohli being appointed captain for an entire series for the first time. [179] In the first game of the series at Harare, he struck 115 runs from 108 balls, helping India chase down the target of 229 and winning the man of the match award. [180] He batted on two more occasions in the series in which he had scores of 14 and 58 not out. India completed a 5–0 sweep of the series; their first in an away ODI series. [181]
"I always had a different kind of feeling when I started working with Virat Kohli. From the beginning, I was very sure that he was a rare talent and would become a great player. He grew massively in these past few years and has matured a lot. I was fortunate to be part of that process of seeing him grow and that give me immense pleasure."

Kohli was in sublime form in the seven-match ODI series against Australia. After top-scoring with 61 in the opening loss at Pune, he struck the fastest century by an Indian in ODIs in the second match at Jaipur. Reaching the milestone in just 52 balls and putting up an unbroken 186-run second-wicket partnership with Rohit Sharma that came in 17.2 overs, [183] Kohli's innings of 100 not out helped India chase down the target of 360 for the loss of one wicket with more than six overs to spare. This chase was the second-highest successful run-chase in ODI cricket, while Kohli's knock became the fastest hundred against Australia and the third-fastest in a run-chase. [184] He followed that innings with 68 in the next match at Mohali in another Indian defeat, [185] before the next two matches were washed out by rain. [186] In the sixth ODI at Nagpur, he struck 115 off only 66 balls to help India successfully chase the target of 351 and level the series 2–2 and won the man of the match. [187] He reached the 100-run mark in 61 balls, making it the third-fastest ODI century by an Indian batsman, and also became the fastest batsman in the world to score 17 hundreds in ODI cricket. [188] India clinched the series after winning the last match in which he was run out for a duck. [189] At the conclusion of the series, Kohli moved to the top position in the ICC ODI batsmen rankings for the first time in his career. [2]
Kohli batted twice in the two-match Test series against West Indies, and had scores of 3 and 57 being dismissed by Shane Shillingford in both innings. This was also the last Test series for Tendulkar and Kohli was expected to take Tendulkar's number four batting position after the series. [190] In the first game of the three-match ODI series that followed at Kochi, Kohli made 86 to seal a six-wicket win and won the man of the match. [191] During the match, he also equaled Viv Richards ' record of becoming the fastest batsman to make 5,000 runs in ODI cricket, reaching the landmark in his 114th innings. Kohli said of the record, "To equal a feat with a player like him [Richards] is a very good feeling but it does not stop here because it is more or less the beginning. I am only 25. It is nice to equal his record but still there is a long way to go." [192] He missed out on his third century at Visakhapatnam in the next match, after being dismissed for 99 playing a hook shot off Ravi Rampaul . [193] India lost the match by two wickets, but took the series 2–1 after winning the last match at Kanpur. [194] With 204 runs at 68.00, Kohli finished the series as the leading run-getter and was awarded the man of the series. [195]
Overseas season
India toured South Africa in December 2013 for three ODIs and two Tests. Kohli averaged 15.50 in the ODIs, including a duck. [196] In the first Test at Johannesburg, playing his first Test in South Africa [197] and batting at 4 for the first time, [198] Kohli scored 119 and 96. His hundred was the first by a subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998. [199] Regarding Kohli's hundred, South Africa bowling coach Allan Donald said, "The one word that comes to my mind is responsibility. I think he [Kohli] showed great discipline and responsibility. It reminds me of Sachin Tendulkar when they came here in 1996." [200] The match ended in a draw, and Kohli was awarded man of the match. [201] India failed to win a single match on the tour, losing the second Test by 10 wickets in which he made 46 and 11. [202]
"[Kohli] is the next chosen one. He exudes the intensity of [Dravid] , the audacity of [Sehwag] , and the extraordinary range of [Tendulkar] . That doesn't make him better, simply sui generis , his own unique kind."

Kohli continued to amass runs on the subsequent New Zealand tour . He averaged 58.21 in the five-match ODI series [204] in which his efforts of 111-ball 123 at Napier, [205] 65-ball 78 at Hamilton [206] and 78-ball 82 at Wellington [207] all went in vain as India were defeated 4–0. He made 214 runs at 71.33 in the two-match Test series that followed [208] including an unbeaten 105 on the last day of the second Test at Wellington that helped India save the match. [209]
India then traveled to Bangladesh for the Asia Cup and World Twenty20. Dhoni was ruled out of the Asia Cup after suffering a side strain during the New Zealand tour, which led to Kohli being named captain for the tournament. [210] Kohli scored 136 off 122 balls in India's opening match against Bangladesh, sharing a 213-run third-wicket stand with Ajinkya Rahane , which helped India successfully chase 280. [211] It was his 19th ODI century and his fifth in Bangladesh, making him the batsman with most ODI centuries in Bangladesh. [212] India narrowly lost the next two matches to Sri Lanka and Pakistan, with Kohli scoring 48 and 5. India were knocked out of the tournament even before their eight-wicket win over Afghanistan, in which Kohli did not bat.
Dhoni returned to the team as captain for 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and Kohli was named vice-captain. In India's opening match of the tournament against Pakistan, Kohli top-scored with 36 not out to guide India to a seven-wicket win. [213] He scored 54 off 41 balls in the next game against West Indies and an unbeaten 57 from 50 balls against Bangladesh, both in successful run-chases. [214] [215] He was dismissed for 23 against Australia but India won the match, topped the group and qualified for the semifinals against South Africa. In the semifinal, he made an unbeaten 72 in just 44 balls to help India achieve the target of 173 with six wickets and five balls to spare. [216] He won the man of the match for this knock which he has called "my best T20 innings". [217] India posted 130/4 in the final against Sri Lanka, in which Kohli scored 77 from 58 balls, and eventually lost the match by six wickets. [218] Kohli had made a total of 319 runs in the tournament at an average of 106.33, a record for most runs by an individual batsman in a single World Twenty20 tournament, [219] for which he won the Man of the Tournament award. [220]
Kohli and other senior players were rested for India's tour of Bangladesh ahead of the England tour . India conceded a 3–1 defeat in the five-match Test series against England despite leading the series 1–0 after the first two Tests. Kohli fared poorly in the series averaging just 13.40 in 10 innings with a top score of 39. [221] He was dismissed for single-digit scores on six occasions in the series and was particularly susceptible to the swinging ball on off stump line, being dismissed several times edging the ball to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders . Man of the series James Anderson got Kohli's wicket four times, while Kohli's batting technique was questioned by analysts and former cricketers. [222] [223] Geoffrey Boycott said, "Jimmy Anderson ate him for breakfast. Every time Kohli came in, all he did was bowl at off stump, around the corridor of uncertainty and Kohli nicked it. He is playing with his bat too far away from his pad. He has to look at video replays of his technique and get back to basics". [224] India won the ODI series that followed 3–1, but Kohli's struggles with the bat continued with an average of 18 in four innings. [225] In the one-off T20I, he scored 41-ball 66, his first fifty-plus score of the tour on the last match of the tour. India lost the match by three runs, [226] but Kohli reached the number one spot for T20I batsmen in the ICC rankings. [3]
2014/15–present: Test captaincy and beyond
Australian tour and World Cup
Kohli had a successful time when West Indies toured India in October 2014. His 62 in the second ODI at Delhi was his first fifty across Tests and ODIs in 16 innings since February, [227] and he stated that he got his "confidence back" with the innings. [228] He struck his 20th ODI hundred–127 runs in 114 balls–in the fourth match at Dharamsala. India registered a 59-run victory and Kohli was awarded man of the match. [229] The tour was cancelled after the fourth ODI due to a pay dispute between the West Indies players and their board, giving India a 2–1 series win. Dhoni was rested for the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in November, enabling Kohli to lead the team for another full series. Kohli batted at 4 throughout the series and made scores of 22, 49, 53 and 66 in the first four ODIs, with India leading the series 4–0. In the fifth ODI at Ranchi, Kohli came in to bat with India at 14/2 in pursuit of 287. He made an unbeaten 139 off 126 balls to give his team a three-wicket win and a whitewash of Sri Lanka. [230] Kohli was awarded player of the series, and it was the second whitewash under his captaincy. [231] During the series he became the fastest batsman in the world to go past the 6000-run mark in ODIs. [232] With 1054 ODI runs at 58.55 in 2014, he became the second player in the world after Sourav Ganguly to make more than 1,000 runs in ODIs for four consecutive calendar years. [4]
For the first Test of the Australian tour , Dhoni was not part of the Indian team at Adelaide due to an injury, and Kohli took the reins as Test captain for the first time. [233] Kohli scored 115 in India's first innings, becoming the fourth Indian to score a hundred on Test captaincy debut. [234] In their second innings, India were set a target of 364 to be scored on the fifth day. Kohli came in to bat when the Indian innings was reduced to 57/2 and started batting aggressively. He put on 185 runs for the third wicket with M Vijay before Vijay's dismissal, which triggered a batting collapse. From 242/2, India were bowled out for 315 with Kohli's 141 off 175 balls being the top score. [235] Kohli noted that his team was looking for a win and not a draw, while also saying that it was "the best Test I have been part of". [236] Kohli's second innings ton was hailed by several Australian commentators as the finest fourth-innings performance they had ever seen in Australia. [237]
Dhoni returned to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket defeat for India. [238] In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, Kohli was India's top-scorer in both innings. He made his personal best Test score of 169 in the first innings while sharing a 262-run partnership with Rahane, India's biggest partnership outside Asia in ten years. [239] Kohli followed it with a resilient 54 in India's second innings on the fifth day, helping India draw the Test match. [240] Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket at the conclusion of this match, and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney. [241] Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli hit 147 in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as Test captain. [242] He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and India hung in for another draw. [243] Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia. [242]

In January 2015, India failed to win a single match in the tri-nation ODI series against the hosts Australia and England. Kohli was unable to replicate his Test success in ODIs, failing to make a two-digit score in any of the four games. Kohli's ODI form did not improve in the lead-up to the World Cup, with scores of 18 and 5 in the warmup matches against Australia and Afghanistan respectively.
In the first match of the World Cup against Pakistan at Adelaide, Kohli hit 107 in 126 balls, sharing 100-plus partnerships with both Dhawan and Raina, to help India set a total of 300 and win the match by 76 runs. For his knock he was awarded the man of the match award, his 20th in ODIs and first in a World Cup match. [244] He was dismissed for 46 in India's second match against South Africa after another century stand with opening batsman Dhawan. India went on to post 307 in 50 overs and register a 130-run victory in that match. [245] India batted second in their remaining four group matches in which Kohli scored 33*, 33, 44* and 38 against UAE , West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe respectively. India went on to secure wins in these four fixtures and top the Pool B points with an undefeated record. [246] In India's quarterfinal match against Bangladesh, Kohli was dismissed by Rubel Hossain edging the ball to the wicket-keeper for 3. India recorded a 109-run victory and qualified for the semifinal. [247] India were eliminated in the semifinal by Australia at Melbourne, where Kohli was dismissed for 1 off 13 balls, top-edging a short ball from Mitchell Johnson . [248]
Subcontinent season
Tour of Bangladesh 2015
Kohli had a slump in form when India toured Bangladesh in June 2015. He contributed only 14 in the one-off Test which ended in a draw and averaged 16.33 in the ODI series which Bangladesh won 2–1. [249] Kohli ended his streak of low scores by scoring his 11th Test hundred in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour which India lost. However, India won the next two matches to seal the series 2–1, Kohli's first series win as Test captain and India's first away Test series win in four years. [250]
South Africa Tour of India 2015
In the Fall of 2015, Kohli was announced as the vice-captain for the T20 and ODI series and captain for the Test Series at home against South Africa. India would go on to lose the three match T20 series 0-2, the third match being abandoned due to rain and a wet outfield. [251] However, Kholi would come to be the second highest run-scorer for India in the series, behind Rohit Sharma , and fourth overall, hitting 44 runs between two innings at a strike rate of 157.14. [252] India would come to fall to a 1-2 deficit in the five-match ODI series, losing both matches by under 20 runs, bring further confrontation towards having the "young," and "aggressive," tactics of Kohli replace current ODI captain MS Dhoni as the Indian ODI captain. [253] Team India would come to win the 4th ODI by 35 runs to level the series 2-2. Kohli would go on to win the Player-of-the-Match award in response to bringing up his 23rd ODI century, playing a heroic innings of 138 at a strike rate of 98.57. [254] Team India would go on to lose the deciding 5th ODI, by 214 runs, due to triplet centuries by South African batsmen: Quinton de Kock , Faf du Plessis , and AB de Villiers . Kohli ended up this series being the 6th highest run-scorer and the third leading run-scorer for India, behind both Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane .
IPL career
In March 2008, Kohli was bought on a youth contract by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000. He had an indifferent 2008 season , with a total of 165 runs in 12 innings at an average of 15.00 and a strike rate of 105.09. [255] He fared slightly better in the second season in which he made a total of 246 runs at 22.36, striking at over 112, while his team made it as far as the final. [256] In the 2010 season , Kohli was the third highest run-getter for his team with 307 runs, averaging 27.90 and improving his strike rate to 144.81. [257]
Ahead of the 2011 season , Kohli was the only player retained by the Royal Challengers franchise. Kohli was made vice-captain of the team that year and also captained the team in a few matches when the regular skipper Daniel Vettori was injured. The Royal Challengers coach Ray Jennings opined that the 22-year-old would become the future captain of not only the franchise but also the Indian team. [258] Kohli was the second-highest run-getter of the season, only behind teammate Chris Gayle , and his team finished as runners-up of the IPL. Kohli accumulated a total of 557 runs at an average of 46.41 and a strike rate of over 121 including four fifties. [259] In the 2012 IPL , he was moderately successful, averaging 28 for his 364 runs. [260]
After Vettori's retirement, Kohli was appointed as the team's captain for the 2013 season . The Royal Challengers finished fifth on the league table that year, but Kohli found success with the bat. Averaging 45.28, he hit a total of 634 runs at a strike rate of over 138 including six fifties and a top-score of 99 and finished as the season's third-highest run-scorer. [261] Bangalore finished seventh in the next season in which Kohli made 359 runs at 27.61. [262] He was in sublime form during the 2015 IPL in which he led his team to the playoffs. He finished fifth on the season's leading run-getters list with 505 runs at an average of 45.90 and a strike rate of more than 130. [263]
Playing style
Kohli playing the flick shot during the 2015 Cricket World Cup .
Kohli is a naturally aggressive batsman [30] with strong technical skills. [264] He usually bats in the middle-order, but, on many occasions, has opened the innings as well. He bats with a slightly open-chested stance [265] [266] and a strong bottom-hand grip, [267] [268] and is said to have quick footwork. [269] He is known for his wide range of shots, ability to pace an innings and batting under pressure. [270] [271] He is strong through the mid-wicket and cover region. [272] He has said that the cover drive is his favorite shot, while also saying that the flick shot comes naturally to him. [11] He does not play the sweep shot often, being called "not a natural sweeper of the cricket ball". [273] His teammates have praised his confidence, commitment, focus and work ethics. [274] [275] [276] [277] Kohli is also known to be a "sharp" fielder. [278] [279]
Kohli is regarded as one of the best limited-overs batsmen in the world, especially while chasing. [280] [281] In ODIs, he averages more than 62 in matches batting second as opposed to over 37 batting first. [282] 14 of his 22 hundreds have come in run-chases, only three fewer than Sachin Tendulkar who holds the record for most hundreds batting second. [283] Regarding his impressive record batting second, Kohli has said "I love the whole situation that comes with chasing. I like the challenge of testing myself, figuring out how to rotate strike, when to hit a boundary." [11]
Kohli is often compared to Tendulkar, due to their similar styles of batting, and is sometimes referred to as Tendulkar's "successor". [190] [200] Many former cricketers expect Kohli to break Tendulkar's batting records. [284] [285] Former West Indies great Vivian Richards , who is regarded as the most destructive batsman in cricket, stated that Kohli reminds him of himself. [165] In early-2015, Richards said Kohli was "already legendary" in the ODI format, [286] while former Australian cricketer Dean Jones called Kohli the "new king of world cricket". [287]
Kohli is noted for his on-field aggression and was described in the media as "brash" and "arrogant" during his early career. [277] [288] He has got into confrontations with players and umpires on several occasions in his career. [277] [289] [290] His aggressive attitude has been backed by many former cricketers, [291] [292] [293] while some have criticised it. [277] [294] [295] In 2012, Kohli had stated that he tries to limit his aggressive behavior but "the build-up and the pressure or the special occasions make it tough to control the aggression." [296]

Personal life
Kohli is currently in a relationship with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma . [297] The relationship has attracted a lot of media attention. [298] [299]
Commercial investments
According to Kohli, football is his second favourite sport. [300] In 2014, Kohli became a co-owner of Indian Super League club FC Goa . He stated that he invested in the club with the "keenness of football" and because he "wanted football to grow in India". He added, "It is also a business venture that I am looking at for the future. Cricket is not going to last forever so, whenever I am done, whenever d team under Cook, scoring 338 runs in four Tests including a century and two fifties. [232] The century, in the second of four Tests, took Pietersen to 22 Test hundreds, level with the England record. Cook, however, proceeded to break the record by scoring his twenty-third hundred during the same series. [233] Pietersen also featured in the tour's ODI series, scoring 185 runs across a five-match series that ended in an English defeat. [234]
Career in 2013–14[ edit ]
Pietersen batting during the 2013 Ashes
Pietersen featured in the three-Test series in New Zealand in February 2013, scoring 73 in the second match. A knee injury forced him to miss the return home series in May that year, however, and prompted fears over fitness for the upcoming 2013 Ashes series. Though he did not play against New Zealand, the ECB remained hopeful over his ability to play against Australia come the summer. [235] On 3 August 2013, Pietersen not only scored a century in the third Ashes series match in the first innings, he became the highest run scorer for England across all forms of cricket combined. [236]
His return Ashes tour over the winter of 2013–14 was less successful, however. In a series which England lost 5–0, Pietersen averaged only 29 and passed fifty only twice in ten innings. He remained nevertheless England's leading run scorer with 294 runs. [237] He also bowled during the fifth and final Test. Once the tour had ended, and the fallout had contributed to the removal of Flower as head coach, there was much media speculation on the nature of Pietersen's relationship with the team management. The ECB met and announced on 4 February 2014 that Pietersen had not been selected for the upcoming tour of the Caribbean , a decision they described as "unanimous". Media announcements immediately began stating that Pietersen's career was over. [238] Pietersen himself released a statement which read "Although I am obviously very sad the incredible journey has come to an end, I'm also hugely proud of what we, as a team, have achieved over the past nine years." [238] [239]
Awards[ edit ]
Pietersen gained several awards for his performances in the 2005 season. He was named both the ICC "ODI Player of the Year" and "Emerging Player of the Year" in 2005, [240] and was one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year (alongside team mates Simon Jones and Matthew Hoggard ) for his role in the successful Ashes series against Australia. [241] Along with the rest of the England team, he was decorated in the 2006 New Year Honours list , being awarded the MBE for his role in the successful Ashes series. [242] He also played for the ICC World XI in the 2005 ICC Super Series against Australia. [243]

Early European contacts[ edit ]
Before Europeans, the island was inhabited by the Kalinago people ( Island Caribs ).
Christopher Columbus spotted the island on 3 November 1493 (Sunday) and named it after the day of the week.
For a century, the island remained isolated. As European explorers and settlers entered the region, indigenous refugees from surrounding islands settled Dominica and pushed out the Spanish settlers, who found other areas easier to control and with more resources. France colonised Dominica for several years, importing numerous African slaves to work on plantations. They soon became a majority on the island, and developed the Antillean Creole language based on French and incorporating their West African languages of origin, and some Carib.
French colony[ edit ]
Spain had little success in colonising Dominica. In 1632, the French Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique claimed Dominica and other "Petite Antilles" for France, but no physical occupation took place. Between 1642 and 1650, French missionary Raymond Breton became the first regular European visitor to the island.
In 1660, the French and English agreed that Dominica and St. Vincent should not be settled, but left to the Caribs as neutral territory. Dominica was officially neutral for the next century. But its natural resources attracted rival expeditions of English and French foresters, who began harvesting timber by the start of the 18th century. [10] In 1690, the French established their first permanent settlements. French woodcutters from Martinique and Guadeloupe began to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood and gradually become permanent settlers. They brought the first enslaved people from West Africa to Dominique, as it was then called. In 1715, a revolt of "poor white" smallholders in the north of Martinique, known as La Gaoulé, [11] caused many to migrate to southern Dominique. They set up smallholdings . Meanwhile, French families and others from Guadeloupe settled in the north. In 1727, the first French commander, M. Le Grand , took charge of the island with a basic French government; Dominique formally became a colony of France, and the island was divided into districts or "quarters". [12] Already installed in Martinique and Guadeloupe and cultivating sugar cane, the French gradually developed plantations in Dominique for coffee. They imported so many African slaves to fill the labour demands that the population became overwhelmingly African in ethnicity.
In 1761, during the Seven Years' War in Europe, a British expedition against Dominica led by Lord Rollo conquered the island along with several other Caribbean islands. After France lost the war in 1763, it ceded the island to Britain under the Treaty of Paris (1763) . The same year, Britain established a legislative assembly , representing only the white population. French remained the official language, but Antillean Creole was spoken by most people. In 1778, during the American Revolutionary War , the French invaded with the active co-operation of the population. The 1783 Treaty of Paris , which ended the war, returned the island to Britain. French invasions in 1795 and 1805 ended in failure. [10]
British colony[ edit ]
A linen market in 1770s Dominica
Great Britain established a small colony in 1805. In 1831, reflecting a liberalisation of official British racial attitudes, the Brown Privilege Bill [13] conferred political and social rights on free blacks (or free people of colour, who generally were of mixed race). In 1834, Britain abolished slavery throughout the British Empire (except in India).
In 1835, the first three men of African descent were elected to the legislative assembly. Many slaves from the neighbouring islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique fled to Dominica. In 1838, Dominica became the first British Caribbean colony to have an elected legislature controlled by an ethnic African majority; most of these legislators had been smallholders or merchants before the abolition of slavery. Their economic and social views were different from the interests of the small, wealthy English planter class. Reacting to a perceived threat to their power, the planters lobbied for more direct British rule. [10]
In 1865, after much agitation and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one that had one-half of members who were elected and one-half who were appointed. Planters allied with colonial administrators outmaneuvered the elected legislators on many occasions. In 1871, Dominica became part of the Leeward Island Federation . The power of the ethnic African population progressively eroded. Crown Colony government was re-established in 1896. All political rights were curtailed for people of colour and blacks, who were the overwhelming majority of the population. Development aid, offered as compensation for disfranchisement, resulted in negligible improvements in conditions for most ethnic Africans. [10]
History post-1900[ edit ]
In 1914–1918 World War I , many Dominicans, mainly the sons of small farmers, volunteered to fight in Europe for the British Empire. After the war, an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the Representative Government Association . Marshaling public frustration with the lack of a voice in governing Dominica, this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924, and one-half in 1936. Shortly thereafter, Dominica was transferred from the Leeward Island Administration . [10] During World War II , some Dominicans volunteered in British and Caribbean forces. Thousands of Free French refugees from Martinique and Guadeloupe escaped to Dominica from the Vichy -controlled French islands and stayed in Roseau and villages.
Until 1958, Dominica was governed as part of the Windwards . Caribbean islands sought independence from 1958 to 1962, and Dominica became a province of the short-lived West Indies Federation . [10] After the federation dissolved, Dominica became an associated state of the United Kingdom in 1967 and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs. On 3 November 1978, the Commonwealth of Dominica was granted independence [10] and almost immediately, a republic. The British Crown was no longer the head of state.
In mid-1979, political discontent led to the formation of an interim government. After the 1980 elections, it was replaced by a government led by the Dominica Freedom Party under Prime Minister Eugenia Charles , the Caribbean's first female prime minister. Chronic economic problems were compounded by the severe impact of hurricanes in 1979 and in 1980.
In 1981, Dominica was threatened with a takeover by mercenaries [14] of Operation Red Dog led by Mike Perdue of Houston and Wolfgang Droege of Toronto , who tried to overthrow the government of Eugenia Charles. The North American mercenaries were to help ex-Prime Minister Patrick John and his Dominica Defence Force regain control of the island, in exchange for control over its future development. The United States FBI was tipped off, and the ship hired to transport the mercenaries never left dock. The mercenaries lacked formal military experience or training, and most of the crew had been misled into joining by the ringleader Mike Perdue. White supremacist Don Black was also jailed for his part in the attempt, which violated US neutrality laws. [15]
By the end of the 1980s, the economy recovered. It weakened again in the 1990s due to a decrease in banana prices and worldwide recession. [10]
In the January 2000 elections, the Edison James United Workers Party (UWP) was defeated by the Dominican Labour Party (DLP), led by Roosevelt P. "Rosie" Douglas . Douglas died after only a few months in office and was replaced by Pierre Charles, who died in office in January 2004. Roosevelt Skerrit , also of the DLP, replaced Charles as Prime Minister. Under Prime Minister Skerrit's leadership, the DLP won elections in May 2005 that gave the party 12 seats in the 21-member Parliament to the UWP's 8 seats. An independent candidate affiliated with the DLP won a seat as well. Later, the independent candidate joined the government and one UWP member crossed the aisle, making the total 14 seats for the DLP and 7 for the UWP. [10]
In the December 2009 elections, DLP won 18 of 21 seats. UWP claimed campaign improprieties and boycotted Parliament; by-elections were conducted for two of its seats in July 2010, and the UWP again won the seats. [16] On 17 September 2012 Eliud Thaddeus Williams was sworn in as President, replacing Dr Nicholas Liverpool who was reportedly removed from office due to ill health.
Geography and climate[ edit ]
Dominica is an island in the Eastern Caribbean Sea , located about halfway between the French islands of Guadeloupe (to the north) and Martinique (to the south)
Map of Dominica.
Main articles: Geography of Dominica and Climate of Dominica
Dominica is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea , the northernmost of the Windward Islands (though it is sometimes considered the southernmost of the Leeward Islands ). The size of the country is about 289.5 square miles (750 km2). The capital is Roseau .
Dominica is largely covered by rainforest and is home to the world's second-largest hot spring , Boiling Lake . [17] Dominica has many waterfalls, springs, and rivers. The Calibishie area in the country's northeast has sandy beaches. [18] Some plants and animals thought to be extinct on surrounding islands can still be found in Dominica's forests. [19] The volcanic nature of the island has attracted scuba divers . The island has several protected areas , including Cabrits National Park , as well as 365 rivers.
On his second voyage to the Caribbean, Dominica was the first New World country that Christopher Columbus discovered. It is said that when his royal sponsors asked Christopher Columbus to describe this island, he crumpled a piece of parchment roughly and threw it on the table. "This", Columbus explained, "is what Dominica looks like—completely covered with mountains with nary a flat spot."[ citation needed ]
Morne Trois Pitons National Park is a tropical forest blended with scenic volcanic features. [20] It was recognised as a World Heritage Site on 4 April 1995, a distinction it shares with four other Caribbean islands. [21]
Calibishie beach landscape
The Commonwealth of Dominica is engaged in a long-running dispute with Venezuela over Venezuela's territorial claims to the sea surrounding Isla Aves (literally Bird Island, but in fact called Bird Rock by Dominica authorities), [22] a tiny islet located 140 miles (225 km) west of the island of Dominica.
There are two primary population centres: Roseau (with 14,725 inhabitants in 2011) and Portsmouth (with 4,167 inhabitants in 2011).
Dominica, known as "The Nature Island of the Caribbean" due to its spectacular, lush, and varied flora and fauna, which are protected by an extensive natural park system; the most mountainous of the Lesser Antilles, its volcanic peaks are cones of lava craters and include Boiling Lake, the second-largest, thermally active lake in the world possesses the most pristine wilderness in the Caribbean. [23] Originally, it was protected by sheer mountains which led the European powers to build ports and agricultural settlements on other islands. More recently, the citizens of this island have sought to preserve its spectacular natural beauty by discouraging the type of high-impact tourism which has damaged nature in most of the Caribbean.
Visitors can find large tropical forests, including one which is on the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites, hundreds of streams, coastlines and coral reefs.
Dominica is home to many local artisans and traditional craftsman who cater to tourists, although not a thriving high end art scene.
The Sisserou parrot (Amazona imperialis) is Dominica's national bird and is endemic to its mountain forests. A related species, the Jaco or red-necked parrot (A. arausiaca),. is also a Dominican endemic. Both birds are rare and protected, though some forest is still threatened by logging in addition to the long-standing threat of hurricanes.
The Caribbean Sea offshore of the island of Dominica is home to many cetaceans . Most notably a group of sperm whales live in this area year round. Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include spinner dolphins , pantropical spotted dolphins and bottlenose dolphins . Less commonly seen animals include killer whales , false killer whales , pygmy sperm whales , dwarf sperm whales , Risso's dolphins , common dolphins , Atlantic spotted dolphins , humpback whales and Bryde's whales . This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in whale-watching .
Dominica is especially vulnerable to hurricanes as the island is located in what is referred to as the hurricane region. In 1979, Dominica was hiefeated both Bangladesh and Ireland to move into the next round. He took 1/9 from two overs in the loss to the West Indies in the Super 8 round, and was left out for the remaining two matches, which India lost to be eliminated. [8]
Since then, Pathan was dropped from the limited overs team and was then injured for an extended period, until he made his return to cricket in the Ranji Trophy in November. He played in six matches for Baroda as captain and was successful with both bat and ball, scoring 397 runs at 49.62 and taking 22 wickets at 18.54. In his most productive first-class season with the bat, Pathan made starts in eight of his nine innings, only failing to reach 24 once, and scoring four fifties, although he was unable to convert any to triple figures. In his fourth match of the season, Pathan top-scored in both innings with 68 and 81 as Baroda lost to Karnataka by an innings after making 153 and 223. He then took a total of 7/76 and scored 65 not out to secure a seven-wicket win over Saurashtra, and then totalled 7/96 in a seven-wicket triumph over Maharashtra. [8] However, these performances were not enough to earn Pathan a Test recall. Furthermore, on 25 February 2010 the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced its list of 30 probables for the T20 World Cup to be held in the West Indies, the most notable omission being Irfan Pathan. [62]

Pathan took 5/100 in the first innings of the Duleep Trophy final against South Zone. His fifth wicket brought up his 300th scalp at first-class level. [8] After cricket was engulfed in a series of corruption scandals in September 2010, Pathan told the media that he had received "three expensive gifts in his room" and, later, two further gifts that he could not afford. Pathan reported this to the team management as he thought the gifts might be from a bookmaker . [63] [64]
Comeback to the national side and knee injury[ edit ]
Irfan Pathan was recalled for India's ODI squad for last two matches of five match one-day series against West Indies in December 2011, [65] and played in last match of the series, picking the wicket of first ball. [66]
He was selected for the Commonwealth Bank Series, playing four games and scoring 96 runs at an average of 24 with a top score of 47. He also succeeded in taking 6 wickets at an average of 31.16; his best figures were 3/16. His strong performances led to his inclusion in the Asia Cup squad. He played three matches and did not get a chance to bat but he proved himself with the ball taking 4/32 in the first match of the series against Sri Lanka. He picked up two more wickets in the next two games. He was the part of the team touring South Africa for the one T20 played on 31 March 2012 where he had figures of 4–0–44–1 but was yet to bat. Pathan also played for the Delhi Daredevils the Indian Premier League in 2012, taking only 8 wickets from 17 matches with an average of 58.12. [67] BCCI announced on 13 July 2012 inclusion of Irfan Pathan in the Indian team for the tour of Sri Lanka as a replacement to the injured Vinay Kumar. [68] With his all round performance, India managed to win four of the five ODIs and the lone T20 match in the next series in Sri Lanka. [69] Pathan emerged as the top wicket taker with a 5-wicket haul. [70]
Irfan Pathan was a part of the Indian squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka. [71] In the Ranji Trophy 2012–13 opener against Karnataka, Pathan raised his First-class top-score to 121 with his 3rd domestic hundred. [72] But, he injured his knee during match and only made comeback to cricket in March 2013. In 2014 he was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad to play in the Indian Premier League . [73]
Cricket Academy Of Pathans[ edit ]
The Cricket Academy Of Pathans was jointly launched by Irfan and Yusuf Pathan .The academy has tied up with former India coach Greg Chappell and Cameron Tradell as chief mentors. Chappell would coach the coaches of the Academy. [74]

In the ICC Under-19 World Cup 1999/00 which India won under the captaincy of Mohammad Kaif , Yuvraj's all-round performance earned him the Player of the Tournament award and a call-up to the national squad. [19] His performance in the tournament included a quickfire 58 off 25 balls against Australia in the semifinal, [20] and 68 off 62 and 4/36 against New Zealand in a group stage match. [21] Yuvraj was subsequently selected in 2000 for the first intake of the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore . [22]
International breakthrough[ edit ]
Yuvraj was selected in the Indian squad for the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy in the back of his impressive outings for the Under-19 team. He made his international debut against Kenya in the pre-quarterfinal. He bowled four overs conceding 16 runs but did not get to bat. In the quarterfinal match against Australia , Yuvraj won the man of the match for his innings of 84 (80), against a pace attack consisting of Glenn McGrath , Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie , that helped India win by 20 runs. [23] In the semifinal against South Africa , he scored 41 and picked 1/15. [24] He scored only 14 against New Zealand in the final which India lost. The tournament was followed by a tri-series involving India, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Yuvraj scored just 55 runs in five innings at an average of 11. Yuvraj averaged 15.50 in the ODI series against the touring Zimbabwe side in December 2000 after which he was dropped from the team.
Yuvraj made his comeback during the 2001 Coca-Cola Cup in Sri Lanka. He scored a crucial 98* against Sri Lanka in the fifth match in an otherwise disappointing series with the bat. [25] However, he proved to be useful with the ball as he picked up 8 wickets at an average of 27. [26] In the Standard Bank triangular series involving hosts South Africa, India and Kenya, Yuvraj managed to score only 69 runs from 6 innings, including a duck in the final against South Africa. [27] Following this, Dinesh Mongia and Hemang Badani were chosen over Yuvraj in the squad for the home series against England in January 2002.
Yuvraj returned to playing domestic cricket in early-2002. After a disappointing run in the Ranji knockouts, Yuvraj struck 209 for North Zone against South Zone in a Duleep Trophy match in March 2002. [28] He was immediately drafted into the national squad for the final two ODIs against Zimbabwe with India trailing the series 1-2. Yuvraj made impact in his return match at Hyderabad , scoring an unbeaten 80 off just 60 balls, to take India to a five-wicket win and level the series. He won the Man of the Match award for his efforts. [29] In the final ODI at Guwahati , Yuvraj made 75 runs from 52 balls, sharing a 157-run fifth-wicket partnership with Mongia who scored his career-best unbeaten 159, to help India post a total of 333 in their 50 overs. India went on to win the game by 101 runs and the series 3-2. [30]
2002 NatWest Series[ edit ]
After winning the ODI series in the West Indies 2-1, where Yuvraj managed scores of 1 and 10, the Indian team toured England in June for the NatWest triangular series and a four-match Test series against the hosts. The NatWest Series featured teams from England and Sri Lanka, apart from India. In the first match at Lord's , Yuvraj won the man of the match for his all-round performance (3/39 and 64*) as India successfully chased down England's total of 271. [31] In the next match against Sri Lanka, Yuvraj scored 31 and shared a crucial 60-run sixth-wicket partnership with Mohammad Kaif to set up another successful run-chase. [32] India's next match against England was washed out due to rain after Yuvraj had scored an unbeaten 40 off 19 balls to take India to 285/4 in their 50 overs. [33] Yuvraj's knock of 37, along with a fifty from Rahul Dravid , helped India recover from 59/4 to reach the target of 188 against Sri Lanka. [34] This win eliminated Sri Lanka from the series with another round of matches still to be played. Yuvraj had scores of 5 and 8 in the final round of matches but proved to be useful with the ball as he picked one wicket in each of the two games. At the end of the round-robin matches, India topped the points table with 19 points while England finished second with 15 points. [35]
The final was played at Lord's on 13 July between India and England. After winning the toss and electing to bat first, England posted a daunting total of 325/5 in 50 overs. In reply, India were struggling at 146/5 at the end of 24 overs, when Kaif joined Yuvraj at the crease. The pair initially stabilised the innings and later scored at a brisk rate. The duo shared a partnership of 121 runs for the sixth wicket which came to an end when Yuvraj was dismissed for 69 (63 balls) as he top-edged a sweep shot in the 42nd over off the bowling of Paul Collingwood resulting in a simple catch to Alex Tudor at short fine leg. India went on to win the game by two wickets with three balls to spare. [36] This was India's first win in the final of an ODI tournament since 2000, after nine consecutive defeats. [37] This win is regarded as one of India's greatest victories in ODI cricket. [38]
2002/03–2004: Ups and downs[ edit ]

[46] He scored 47 in the final Test at Rawalpindi where India secured the series with another innings victory.

In October 2004, after the first two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , he was dropped from the Test squad as his dismal run with the bat yielded just 47 runs from the two matches.
2004/05–2007: Revival in form[ edit ]
Despite the dip in form towards the end of 2004, Yuvraj continued to be a regular feature in the Indian ODI team. In the Platinum Jubilee Match against Pakistan in November 2004, Yuvraj scored a 62-ball 78 in a losing cause. [48] In December 2004, Yuvraj scored 94 runs at an average of 31.33 in the three-match ODI tour of Bangladesh including a blistering knock of 69 from 32 balls in the final ODI at Dhaka . [49] He had a disappointing ODI series at home against Pakistan in April 2005, scoring 98 runs in six matches at 19.60. [50]
In July–August 2005, Yuvraj was the leading run-getter for India in the 2005 Indian Oil Cup triangular series in Sri Lanka also involving the hosts Sri Lanka and West Indies. He scored 192 runs in four matches, averaging 48. [51] He also recorded his third ODI century during the series - 110 runs from 114 balls (11 fours and one six) - against West Indies at Colombo for which he was awarded the man of the match.

He averaged 54 with the bat in the series, scoring 216 runs from 5 matches. [53] His innings of 120, in the final round-robin match against Zimbabwe at Harare , helped India recover from a precarious position of 36/4 and successfully chase down the target of 251. It was his fourth ODI hundred and he won the man of the match award for his efforts. [54] In the two-match Test tour of Zimbabwe that followed the tri-series in September, Yuvraj had scores of 12 and 25. In October–November 2005, Yuvraj had a quiet seven-match ODI series at home against Sri Lanka. He managed just 124 runs in six innings at an average of 31 with a top-score of 79*.

He scored 53 and 49 in the final two matches at Delhi and Ahmedabad respectively, and the series was drawn 2-2. Yuvraj and South African captain Graeme Smith were jointly awarded the man of the series as each of them scored 209 runs at 69.66, finishing as joint-highest run-getters of the series. [56] Yuvraj had a mixed home Test series against Sri Lanka in December 2005 as he registered two ducks and two half-centuries. He scored 0 & 77* in the second Test at Delhi , and 0 & 75 in the third Test at Ahmedabad as India won both the matches by comfortable margins.
Yuvraj was picked in both Test and ODI squads for the Pakistan tour in January–February 2006. The first two Tests were drawn in which Yuvraj batted only once, in the second Test, scoring 4. In the third Test at Karachi , Yuvraj top-scored for India in both innings. After scoring 45 in the first innings, he went to score his second Test hundred in the second innings (122 runs from 144 balls). India lost the match by 341 runs and the series 1-0. [57] In the one-day series, he continued to be in sublime form. He scored a 28-ball 39 in the first ODI at Peshawar which Pakistan won by 7 runs by Duckworth–Lewis method . [58] He scored an unbeaten 82 in the second match at Rawalpindi taking India to an emphatic 7-wicket win, [59] before scoring an unbeaten 79 in the third game at Lahore and helping India successfully chase the target of 289.

His innings of 107* which came off 93 balls with 13 boundaries, helped India comfortably chase down the target of 287 for the loss of only two wickets. He won the man of the match award for this innings and was also adjudged player of the series. [62]
Against England, Yuvraj averaged 21.33 in two Tests in March but proved to be successful with both bat and ball in the ODI series in which he again won the player of the series award. During the series, Yuvraj won back-to-back man of the match awards in the third and fourth ODIs. In the third match, he made 103 from 76 balls, and in the fourth match, he picked 2/34 and scored 48. He scored a total of 237 runs in the series at an average of 47.40 and picked up 6 wickets with his part-time bowling. [63]
On India's tour of the West Indies , Yuvraj hit two fifties in the ODI series. In the second ODI at Kingston, with India needing two runs to win with one wicket in hand and three balls to spare, Yuvraj was bowled by Dwayne Bravo for 93. India went on to lose the series 4-1. Yuvraj's poor run of form in Tests continued, with him scoring 104 runs from four matches at an average of 17.33 and a top-score of 39. In September 2006, Yuvraj was dropped from the playing eleven during the 2006-07 DLF Cup in Kuala Lumpur after he registered two consecutive ducks against Australia and West Indies. He played in two group matches of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy held in India in October. and scored 27* against England and 27 against West Indies. During a training session before India's final group fixture against Australia, Yuvraj suffered a ligament injury in his left knee. Mongia replaced him for the match which India lost to crash out of the tournament. In November, Indian team physio Andrew Leipus suggested that Yuvraj is unlikely to recover from the injury before the start of the World Cup in March 2007. [64]
Yuvraj was not named in any of the Indian squads that toured South Africa in late-2006. In January 2007, less than two months before the World Cup, Yuvraj made a comeback from injury for the last two matches of the four-match ODI series against West Indies, but did not make much of an impact in either game. Despite concerns over his fitness, Yuvraj was selected in the 15-man Indian squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup , with the chairman of selectors Dilip Vengsarkar confirming Yuvraj was fit. [65] Yuvraj featured in the last two matches of the four-ODI series against Sri Lanka in February 2007, and struck an unbeaten 83-ball 95 in the deciding final game at Visakhapatnam. India won the match by seven wickets and the series 2-1. [66]

[67] In India's next group match at Port-of-Spain against World Cup debutants Bermuda, Yuvraj hit 83 off 46 balls to help India post a total of 413/5, the highest World Cup total. [68] After the big win against Bermuda, India were left with a must-win final group fixture against Sri Lanka. Chasing 255 to win the match, Yuvraj was dismissed run out for 6, as India were bowled out for 185 and made an early exit from the World Cup.
2007 World Twenty20 and vice-captaincy[ edit ]
On 19 September 2007 against England in the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 Super 8 match held at Kingsmead in Durban, he hit 6 Sixes in an over off Stuart Broad . This helped him to reach the fastest fifty ever in a Twenty20 game, off just 12 balls and also the fastest in any form of international cricket. [69] [70] [71] This was the fourth time that six sixes had been hit in one over in senior cricket, the first time in Twenty20 cricket, and the first time in any form of international cricket against a bowler from a Test playing nation. He has also hit the longest six of the tournament: 119 metres (390 ft) off Australian bowler Brett Lee . [72] Yuvraj was awarded a Porsche 911 for his 6 sixes achievement by the Vice President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Lalit Modi . Yuvraj also received Rs.10,000,000 (US$252,716) in cash from the BCCI for his performance in the tournament. [73] He is also the first Indian player to cross 100 Sixes in Twenty 20 matches.
Yuvraj also scored 70 runs off 30 balls and went on to claim the Man of the Match against Australia in the World Twenty20 semifinals at Durban. [74]
In September 2007, he was named as the ODI vice-captain of Mahendra Singh Dhoni after the resignation of Rahul Dravid. He then scored 121 in a losing cause during India's One-day International series defeat at the hands of Australia before enjoying a return to form as India beat Pakistan 3-2 on home soil in November 2007. He was named Man of the series. In the five matches, he scored four half-centuries, although he was fined after showing dissent in the final match in Jaipur. Yuvraj was included in India's Test squad to face Pakistan in November 2007, but was not included in the playing 11 for the first test. Yuvraj was picked in the 3rd Test due to an injured Sachin Tendulkar . India was 61/4 before he and Sourav Ganguly made a 300 run partnership with Yuvraj recording his highest Test score of 169. He had a very poor Test series against Australia in Indian tour to that country in 2007/08. After his poor showing in the first two Tests he was dropped for the remainder of the series. In November 2008, he hit 138 not out from 78 balls against England at Rajkot, taking 64 balls to reach his century which at the time was the second fastest by an Indian in ODIs after Mohammad Azharuddin 's century in 1988 against New Zealand came off 62 balls. After reaching 50 from 42 balls, he added a further 88 in the next 36 balls. He did so despite straining his back, which necessitated the use of Gautam Gambhir as a runner. This was followed by 118 from 122 balls and a 4/28 all his wickets being specialist batsmen in the next match in Indore, earning him two consecutive man of the match awards. Yuvraj scored 85 not out put on an unbroken partnership of 163 with Sachin Tendulkar to defeat England in the First Test at Chennai in December 2008. It was the fourth highest successful run chase in history and the highest in India. Yuvraj scores a quick, unbeaten 54 in the second innings of the Napier Test against New Zealand to help India save the game after following on. India preserves their lead and go on to win the series 1-0.
Yuvraj was dropped from the Asia Cup following the team's return from the World Twenty20 in West Indies. Lack of form, disciplinary reasons and fitness are talked of as the reasons for his exclusion, but he makes a return for the series against Sri Lanka. With Suresh Raina scoring a century on Test debut and Cheteshwar Pujara making a compelling case for higher honors with his consistent first-class performances, Yuvraj is dropped from the Test squad for the two-match series against Australia.
World Cup was dream for Yuvraj as he scored 362 runs including one century and four fifties takes 15 wickets, wins four Man-of-the-Match awards and is also Player of the Tournament. In the process, he becomes the first allrounder to score 300-plus runs and take 15 wickets in a single World Cup. In the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, in India's match against Ireland, he became the first player to take 5 Wickets and score 50 runs in a World Cup match. He took his 100th ODI wicket, with the dismissal of Wesley Barresi in the 2011 World Cup match against the Netherlands. In the 2011 World Cup till he took charge of the chase against defending champions Australia. In recent years, he has added value to the side through his improved off spin.
In the ICC World Cup 2011, he has thus far won the Man of the Match award four times, which is joint best with Sri Lanka's Aravinda de Silva in 1996 and South Africa's Lance Klusener in 1999. Yuvraj had respiratory difficulties through 2011 and in May he withdrew from the ODI series in the West Indies due to an illness. He toured England but had to return home after breaking his finger in the Nottingham Test and later played two home Tests against West Indies. However, he then pulled out of the ODI series against West Indies in November citing an abnormal tumor in his lung. Yuvraj had originally targeted the CB series in Australia for his return to international cricket.
His issues began with breathing difficulties, nausea and bouts of vomiting blood before India's successful run through the 2011 World Cup, which he ended as the player of the tournament. Post ICC World Cup he was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor stage-1 in his left lung and underwent chemotherapy treatment at the Cancer Research Institute in Boston , USA as well as the Indiana University Melvin & Bren Simon Cancer Center in Indianapolis , Indiana where he was cared for by famed oncologist Dr. Lawrence Einhorn . His mother Shabnam Singh was with him during his diagnosis in USA.
2012–present[ edit ]
In March 2012, Yuvraj was discharged from hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April.
After his chemotherapy sessions treating seminoma in Indianapolis, Yuvraj's cancer showing full signs of remission, he aimed at resuming cricket at the World Twenty20. The selectors picked Yuvraj Singh to be a part of the 15-member Indian squad for the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka in September, 2012.
He played against New Zealand in a T20I at Chennai where he scored 34 off 26 balls (1 four, 2 sixes) as his side lost by only 1 run. He started his World Twenty20 campaign with a 3/24 against Afghanistan. He took 1/16 against Australia, 2/16 against Pakistan and a 2/23 against South Africa. He ended up being the highest wicket taker for India in the tournament, though he could not match up to the expectations with his bat.
He got selected to the Test series against England at home, and while preparing for test, he played a single Duleep Trophy match against Central Zone at Hyderabad where he scored 208 off 241 balls (33 fours and 3 sixes) before being caught and bowled by Murali Kartik . Then he also starred in a first class match against England as a member of India A cricket team , where he scored 59 (7 fours and 4 sixes), and took 5/94 at Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai . He later played 3 test matches in the 4 match test series against England after which he was dropped. He later was selected for the India Pakistan Series in the second T20 he came back to form by scoring a blistering 72 off just 36 balls. He could not make an impact in the One Day series against Pakistan and England only scoring 1 half century in 7 matches. He did not have a very good IPL troubled by a back injury and bad form he was dropped from the squad for the Champions Trophy and Zimbabwe series. He made a come back through India A against West Indies A series scoring 123 off just 89 balls in the first ODI followed by 40 off 58 balls and 61 off 59 balls.
In September 2013, Yuvraj made a comeback to India's limited-over’s squad for the Twenty20 and first three ODIs of the home series against Australia. However, following a fitness programme in France, he has shown a return to top form in List A cricket.
He was the leading run-getter for India A in the limited-overs series against the touring West Indies A, with 224 runs from three matches, including one hundred and a fifty at an average of 74.66. He also scored a half-century for India Blue in the Challenger Trophy, a domestic 50-overs tournament.
In October 2013, Yuvraj scored 77 off 35 showed his dominance in the only T20I against Australia at Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot. India was facing an asking-rate of nearly 12 at 100 for 4 in the 12th over but Yuvraj's response was so forceful that all Dhoni needed to do was give him the strike. By the end, the partnership was 102 at exactly two runs a ball. But Yuvraj had a woeful home ODI series against Australia in October, scoring 19 runs in four innings, when he was visibly troubled by the pace of Mitchell Johnson .
He couldn't bat himself back into form in the home ODIs against West Indies or on the South Africa tour and was expected to be dropped for the New Zealand tour given the conditions in that country and the hosts' pace-heavy attack.
In February 2014, Yuvraj was bought by the Royal Challengers Bangalore for 14 crore. Kingfisher Airlines employee union sent a letter to Yuvraj. It requests him not to play for Royal Challengers Bangalore .
He was not selected for Asia Cup 2014 in Bangladesh but he selected for the World T20 same place. Yuvraj performances in the practice matches were major boosts for India ahead of the World T20.
In Super10 match against he missed a full delivery and was bowled second ball. In both matches, he put down what could have been costly misses Chris Gayle and Mohammad Hafeez but India created and converted more chances soon after. His solitary over in the tournament so far went for 13.
Yuvraj Singh scored 60 of 43 balls is his third fifty against Australia at Mirpur and his eighth in T20Is. Yuvraj has gone past Gautam Gambhir to become the top run-scorer for India in T20 internationals.
He had 84-run partnership with Mahendra Singh Dhoni is India's third-highest for the fifth wicket. India's highest partnership for the fifth wicket came in their last match against the same opposition, when Yuvraj and Dhoni added 102 while chasing 202 in Rajkot.
On 5 July 2014, he played for the Rest of the World XI against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's , as he had been left out of India's ODI team. Under Shane Warne's captaincy, he struck almost a-run-a-ball century to rescue his team who had been struggling at 59 for 3. His 100 came up as he hit Sachin Tendulkar for a boundary. Rest of the World finished on 293 for 7 after 50 overs, but MCC went on to win the match by 7 wickets. [75] Notably, Singh was one of the five senior players who were not considered for the 2015 World Cup and was not included in India's 30-man probables for the tournament. At the 2014–15 Ranji Trophy that followed the selection, Singh scored three centuries and finished with 671 runs in 7 matches with an average of 55.91. In September 2015, Yuvraj was named Vice-Captain of the Punjab Cricket Team .
Playing style[ edit ]
Yuvraj during fielding practice.
Yuvraj is primarily a left-handed batsman but can bowl part-time left-arm orthodox spin, which he improved in the latter part of his career. He is regarded as a better batsman against fast bowling than spin bowling , and cites the Indian Oil Cup 2005 as a turning point in his career. [76] Yuvraj is one of the athletic fielders in the Indian team, fielding primarily at point & covers with a good aim at the stumps. Yuvraj is a natural strokeplayer with an aggressive style of play, as seen by his strike rate of above 150 in T20 internationals & just below 90 in ODIs. Many regard him as one of the best clean strikers of the ball, with his trademark punch through the covers a treat to watch. When in good touch, he can clear the ropes quite effortlessly. A Cricinfo report published in late 2005 showed that since 1999, he was the fourth most prolific fielder in affecting ODI run outs , and of those on the list of prolific fielders, he had the second highest rate of effecting a run out. [77] He was previously often characterised as having attitude problems, [78] but later often assumed leadership positions during Rahul Dravid 's tenure as captain.
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
He was the icon player and captain for Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kings XI Punjab in the first two seasons; in 2010, the third season, icon player status was abolished and the captaincy given to Kumar Sangakkara . They came second in the round-robin phase of the tournament, but lost their semi-final to the Chennai Super Kings . On 1 May 2009, Yuvraj picked up his first hat-trick in T20 cricket against Royal Challengers Bangalore at Kingsmead in Durban , the same ground where he hit his six sixes. He dismissed Robin Uthappa , Mark Boucher and Jacques Kallis . On 17 May 2009, Yuvraj picked up his second Twenty20 hat-trick against Deccan Chargers at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. Yuvraj dismissed Herschelle Gibbs , Andrew Symonds and Venugopal Rao .
The Pune Warriors were a new team introduced for the 2011 IPL. Yuvraj Singh was bought by the team and chosen as captain. [79] Pune Warriors finished ninth, ahead of only the Delhi Daredevils .

MCC ruling, May 1894[ edit ]
Before 1895, "first-class cricket" was a common term used loosely to suggest that a match had a high standard; adjectives like "great" and "important" were also loosely applied to high standard matches. There was at the time no concept of what became Test cricket and so an international match would be called a first-class one, as would any match involving two major county clubs. At the beginning of the 1860s, there were only four formally constituted county clubs: Sussex County Cricket Club is the oldest, formed in 1839, and it had been followed by Kent , Nottinghamshire and Surrey . In the early 1860s, several more clubs were founded and questions began to be raised in the sporting press about which should be categorised as first-class, but there was considerable disagreement in the answers. In 1880, the Cricket Reporting Agency was founded. It acquired influence through the decade especially by association with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack (Wisden) and the press came to generally rely on its information and opinions. [1]
The term acquired official status, though limited to matches in Great Britain, following a meeting at Lord's Cricket Ground (Lord's) in May 1894 between the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) committee and the secretaries of the clubs involved in the official County Championship , which had begun in 1890. As a result, those clubs became first-class from 1895 along with MCC, Cambridge University , Oxford University , senior cricket touring teams (i.e.., Australia and South Africa at that time) and other teams designated as such by MCC (e.g., North v South , Gentlemen v Players and occasional "elevens" which consisted of recognised first-class players). [2] Officially, therefore, the inaugural first-class match was the opening game of the 1895 season between MCC and Nottinghamshire at Lord's on 1 and 2 May, MCC winning by 37 runs. [3]
ICC ruling, May 1947[ edit ]
Definition[ edit ]
The term "first-class cricket" was formally defined by the then Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) on 19 May 1947. It was made clear that the definition "will not have retrospective effect". [4] The definition is as follows: [4]
A match of three or more days' duration between two sides of eleven players officially adjudged first-class, shall be regarded as a first-class fixture. Matches in which either team have more than eleven players or which are scheduled for less than three days shall not be regarded as first-class. The Governing body in each country shall decide the status of teams.
For example, MCC was authorised to determine the status of matches played in Great Britain. For all intents and purposes, the 1947 ICC definition confirmed the 1894 MCC definition and gave it international recognition and usage.
Hence, official judgment of status is the responsibility of the governing body in each country that is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The governing body grants first-class status to international teams and to domestic teams that are representative of the country's highest playing standard. Later ICC rulings make it is possible for international teams from associate members of the ICC to achieve first-class status but it is dependent on the status of their opponents in a given match. [5]
According to the ICC definition, a match may be adjudged first-class if: [5]
it is of three or more days scheduled duration
each side playing the match has eleven players
each side may have two innings
the match is played on natural, and not artificial, turf
the match is played at a venue which meets certain standard criteria re venues
the match conforms to the Laws of Cricket , except for only minor amendments
the sport’s governing body in the appropriate nation, or the ICC itself, recognises the match as first-class.
A Test match is a first-class match played between two ICC full member countries subject to their current status at the ICC and the application of ICC conditions when the match is played. [5]
A peculiarity of the two-innings match is the follow-on law. If the team that batted second is substantially behind on first innings total, it may be required to bat again (i.e., to immediately "follow on" from its first innings rather than the innings alternating as they would normally) in the third innings of the match. [6]
Recognised matches[ edit ]
In 2010, the ICC published its Classification of Official Cricket which includes the criteria with which a match must comply to achieve a desired categorisation. In the section on first-class cricket, there is a list of the types of match that should qualify. It is important to note, given the differences in opinion about what constitutes a first-class match, that the ICC clearly stipulates that its match type list "is not exhaustive and is merely indicative of the matches which would fall into the first-class definition". For example, the list includes matches of recognised first-class teams versus international touring teams; and the major domestic championships (using their then-current names) such as the County Championship , Sheffield Shield , Ranji Trophy , etc. [5]
No retrospective effect[ edit ]
The absence of any ICC ruling about matches played before 1947 (or before 1895 in Great Britain) is problematic for those cricket statisticians who wish to categorise earlier matches in the same way. They have responded by compiling tDomestic career[ edit ]
Kaul made his debut for the Punjab cricket team against Orissa in the 2007-08 Ranji Trophy , alongside his brother who was wicket-keeper for the match. He took a five wicket haul in the first innings , and finished with figures of 5/97. [1] He has also made appearances for the Punjab youth teams, at Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 levels. [2]
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
For the Indian Premier League's inaugural season, a number of members of the victorious India Under-19s team from the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup and other specified youngsters were named as players to be drafted by teams in the Indian Premier League, whilst other youth players would have to be chosen to play for their local teams. [3] Kaul was chosen by the Kolkata Knight Riders , based in Kolkata , West Bengal , and captained by Sourav Ganguly . [4]
Youth international career[ edit ]
Kaul was named in the squad for the India U-19s team for the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia . He played in all of India's matches as they proceeded to the final, where they defeated the South African U-19 cricket team by 12 runs (adjusted by the DL method ). [5] He took 10 wickets at an average of 15.40, putting him joint tenth on the list of highest wicket-takers for the tournament. [6]



From today's featured article
The NJ State House , where the 1894 acts were passed
Boroughitis was a political phenomenon in the American state of New Jersey in the 1890s, particularly in Bergen County . Attempts by the New Jersey Legislature to reform local government and the school systems led to the formation of dozens of low-population boroughs . In the late 19th century, much of New Jersey was divided into large townships , in which there might be several small communities, each with a local school that formed its own district. Political disputes arose between the growing number of commuters , who wanted more government services, and farmers, who feared higher taxes. In 1894, the legislature passed an act allowing boroughs that were formed from parts of two or more townships to elect a representative to the county Board of Chosen Freeholders . This law, in combination with a second one the same year that consolidated the school districts into one per township, made it easy and attractive for dissatisfied communities to break away and become boroughs. Forty new boroughs were formed in 1894 and 1895, with the bulk in Bergen County, where townships were broken up or greatly reduced in size; few townships remain in the county today.

Cricket career[ edit ]
Prasad took 96 wickets from 33 Tests at an average of 35, and 196 wickets from 161 ODIs at an average of 32.3. Prasad was more effective on wickets that helped seam bowling even though his best Test bowling figures of 6 for 33, achieved against Pakistan in the 1999 Test series in India, came on a docile pitch in Chennai ; these figures included a spell of bowling in which he took 5 wickets for 0 runs. Notably, he once took 10 wickets in a Test match in Durban, South Africa, in December 1996. It remains his only ten wicket haul in Test cricket. Prasad also took five wicket hauls in England, in 1996, in Sri Lanka, in 2001, and in the West Indies, in 1997. Prasad played his final Test match in Sri Lanka in 2001. One of his finest moments came in 1996 Cricket World Cup when after being hit for a boundary and openly sledged by Pakistan batsman Aamir Sohail , Prasad clean bowled Sohail the very next ball, (which many consider the turning point of the match). Prasad was known for his slower deliveries and was one of its first proponents in world cricket. [2]
Prasad struggled with injuries and dipping form towards the end of his career. He was dropped from the Indian team after 2001 test series in Sri Lanka. Prasad tried unsuccessfully to make a come back after that before retiring from all cricket in May 2005, having secured two Ranji Trophy championships with Karnataka . He was made coach of the India Under-19 Cricket team in January. He was the coach of the U-19 team that finished runners-up in the 2006 U-19 Cricket World Cup .
After the disappointing performance of the Indian Team in World Cup 2007 , Prasad was appointed as the bowling coach of the team for the Bangladesh Tour in May. It was his return to the Indian team after a span of 3 years. On 15 October 2009, Venkatesh Prasad and fielding coach Robin Singh were sacked by the BCCI , which did not give any reasons for the unceremonious dumping. [3]
Personal life[ edit ]
Prasad is married to Jayanthi Prasad a palghat Iyer Brahmin. It was the second marriage for Jayanthi. They have a son named Prithvi. Jayanthi did not have any children from her first marriage. [4]



Etymology[ edit ]
The origin of the name Barbados is either the Portuguese word Barbados or the Spanish equivalent los Barbados, both meaning "the bearded ones". It is unclear whether "bearded" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ), indigenous to the island; or to the allegedly bearded Caribs once inhabiting the island; or, more fancifully, to a visual impression of a beard formed by the sea foam that sprays over the outlying reefs. In 1519, a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker Visconte Maggiolo showed and named Barbados in its correct position. Furthermore, the island of Barbuda in the Leewards is very similar in name and was once named Las Barbudas by the Spanish.
It is uncertain which European nation arrived first in Barbados. According to some sources it was the Spanish. Others believe the Portuguese , en route to Brazil , [12] [13] were the first Europeans to come upon the island.
The original name for Barbados in the Pre-Columbian era was Ichirouganaim according to accounts by descendants of the indigenous Arawakan -speaking tribes in other regional areas, with possible translations including "Red land with white teeth", [14] "Redstone island with teeth outside (reefs)", [15] or simply "Teeth". [16] [17] [18]
Other names or nicknames associated with Barbados include "Bim" and "Bimshire". The origin is uncertain but several theories exist. The National Cultural Foundation of Barbados says that "Bim" was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the Igbo term bém from bé mụ́ meaning 'my home, kindred, kind', [19] the Igbo phoneme /e/ in the Igbo orthography is very close to [ ɪ ]. [20] The name could have arisen due to the relatively large percentage of enslaved Igbo people from modern-day southeastern Nigeria arriving in Barbados in the 18th century. [21] [22]
The words 'Bim' and 'Bimshire' are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionaries . Another possible source for 'Bim' is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, where the Rev. N. Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge ) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were "Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire and Bimshire". [19] Lastly, in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara, i.e. Guyana) of 1652 there is a reference to Bim as a possible corruption of 'Byam', the name of a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as 'Bims' and that this became a word for all Barbadians. [19]
Main article: History of Barbados
Statue of Bussa , Bridgetown. Bussa led the largest slave rebellion in Barbadian history.
Amerindian settlement of Barbados dates to about the 4th to 7th centuries AD, by a group known as the Saladoid-Barrancoid. [23] In the 13th century, the Kalinago arrived from South America. [24]
The Spanish and Portuguese briefly claimed Barbados from the late 16th to the 17th centuries. The Arawaks are believed to have fled to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Spanish and Portuguese made little impact and left the island uninhabited. Some Arawaks migrated from British Guiana (modern-day Guyana) in the 19th century and continue to live in Barbados. [24] [25] [26]
From the arrival of the first English settlers in 1627–1628 untie the series 2–1. This Test series was marked by Ganguly's comeback to the Indian team. [18]
In December 2006, India played and won its first ever Twenty20 international in South Africa, becoming the most recent Test team to play Twenty20 cricket. The beginning of 2007 had seen a revival in the Indian team's ODI fortunes before the 2007 Cricket World Cup . Series victories against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, marked by the comeback of Ganguly, and strong form by Tendulkar, and the emergence of young players like Robin Uthappa saw many pundits to tip India as a real contender to win the 2007 Cricket World Cup . However, defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw India fail to reach the second round. After winning the Test series against England in August 2007, Dravid stepped down as the captain of the team following which Dhoni was made the captain of the Twenty20 and ODI team. In September 2007, India won the first-ever Twenty20 World Cup held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by 5 runs in the final. In 2007–08, they toured Australia where India lost the controversial Test series 2–1, but managed to win the CB series the following month with a whitewash final of Australia. [19]
In April 2009, India secured their first Test series win in New Zealand in 41 years. After beating Sri Lanka 2–0 in December 2009, India became the No. 1 Test team in the world. They retained the ranking by drawing series against South Africa and Sri Lanka. In October 2010, India whitewashed Australia 2–0 in the home Test series, giving them back-to-back series wins against them. Later that year, India managed to draw the Test series in South Africa at 1–1. [20]

Career[ edit ]
He's an aggressive right-handed batsman and has gained attention from selectors and fans through his strokeplay and high runs scoring in Indian domestic cricket. Because of his front foot play and ability to attack the bowler by charging down the pitch, many have compared his batting style to England's Kevin Pietersen . Tiwary was named in the ODI squad to Bangladesh , however he failed to make the playing eleven after sustaining an injury in training, the morning he was supposed to debut. He eventually made his debut against Australia in the 2008 Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series in which he scored only 2 runs in his only innings. He was later included in the India team for the West Indies tour of 2011, as a replacement for Yuvraj Singh , who opted out of the series due to a lung infection. Manoj Tiwary played the 4th and 5th ODI in the series. He later got picked for England's tour of India in October. He played in the 5th ODI and got 24 runs. He also played the only T20 and scored 15 runs. Tiwary was subsequently named in the squad for the ODI's against West Indies in November–December. He played in the 5th ODI at Chennai when India was down by 2 wickets for only 1 run in the very first over of the match. He then went on build a solid innings which got him his scoring maiden ODI century (104 not out) despite having cramps and retired soon after getting his century. [1] Eventually India won the match by 34 runs and he was awarded the Man-Of-The-Match for this match-winning knock. Even after the unbeaten century, Tiwary was made to sit in the reserves for 14 successive matches following the century. However, he made an auspicious comeback as an all-rounder replacing leg spinner Rahul Sharma against Sri Lanka at Colombo as he took 4/61 from his 10 overs with his leg-breaks to restrict the hosts to 251/8. He took the wickets of Dinesh Chandimal , Angelo Mathews , Jeevan Mendis and Thisara Perera , and followed it with a fighting 21 from 38 at a tough time coming at 60/3. India eventually won the match as Virat Kohli scored an unbeaten ton. Tiwary also was picked for the Commonwealth Bank tri-series against Australia and Sri Lanka,but he didn't play any matches. Manoj Tiwary was again selected in the Indian team for the Asia Cup 2012 where again he didn't play any matches. Tiwary was also selected for the lone T20 against South Africa which was played celebrating 150 years of settlement of Indians in South Africa.
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
Tiwary was signed by the Delhi Daredevils for a sum of USD 675,000 in the initial seasons of the Indian Premier League . He was traded to the Kolkata Knight Riders in exchange for Moises Henriques before the 2010 IPL season. In the auction for 4th edition of the Indian Premier League , he was signed by the Kolkata Knight Riders for a sum of USD 475,000.
In the fourth as well as the fifth season of the IPL, he has been a permanent fixture in the Kolkata Knight Riders middle order.
In the fifell in the last over and the hosts ended five runs adrift of the target. He scored a similarly rapid 31 in the fourth match, but India fell 24 runs short. Harbhajan ended the series with 81 runs at 20.25. [19]
In the three home Tests against Sri Lanka, Harbhajan was the highest wicket-taker with 13 scalps, but these came at an average cost of 41.00. After taking 2/189 in the drawn First Test, he aggregated 5/152 and 6/192 as India took the next two fixtures by an innings. [19] In the subsequent ODI series, he took six wickets at 35.00 at an economy rate of 4.88 as India won 3–1. He took 2/58 from his ten overs in the first match, which proved to be tidy in the context of a match in which both teams passed 410 and India prevailed by three runs. [19]
During the tri-series in Bangladesh in January 2010, Harbhajan took six wickets at 24.00 in three matches. He missed the First Test due to neck pain but returned to take a total of 2/123 as India completed a clean sweep with a ten-wicket win in the Second Test. [19]
During New Zealand's tour of India in November 2010, Harbhajan scored his maiden Test century during the First Test in Ahmedabad. This was the 100th century by an Indian in the second innings and he reached triple figures with a six. His 115, along with Laxman's 91 saved the game for India after they had collapsed to 5/15. Harbhajan was named man of the match. He followed on in the next test with 111* in India's 1st innings, becoming the first no. 8 batsman to score back-to-back test centuries. [142]
After an ordinary performance with the ball in the 5-match ODI series in West Indies in June 2011 (where he was the vice captain to skipper Suresh Raina ) (took 4 wickets from 3 matches, best of 3/32), he helped his team revive from dire straits in the 1st Test in Sabina Park at Kingston , Jamaica. With India struggling at 85/6, he along with Suresh Raina initiated a counter-attack to string an aggressive 146-run partnership with Suresh Raina (82 of 115 balls, 15 fours) to help India reach 246. Harbhajan scored 70 from 74 balls (10 fours, 1 six).
2011 Exclusion[ edit ]
Following a few poor performances, Harbhajan was injured in India's tour of England in the summer/monsoon of 2011 and was ruled out of the rest of the series. He returned to competitive cricket to lead the Mumbai Indians to 2011 Champions League Twenty20 title, but fell out of favor with the national selectors. He was not chosen in the home series squad against England in October and West Indies in November and December. Mumbai Indians won their first ever championship under his captaincy, winning the Champions League by 31 runs. Harbhajan was man of the match for his contribution. Harbhajan was also not selected for the Australian tour and the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh. He went to play the IPL 2012 which was not that successful for him, but took his team to semi final while being captain. Harbhajan is now going to play for Essex in England but is not selected for the Sri Lankan tour before the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 . In his debut match for Essex against Gloucestershire, Harbhajan did not take any wicket on 12 July 2012, conceding 33 runs in his 12 overs. [143] He has, however, been included in 30 probables for the World T20 tournament being held in Sri Lanka in September 2012. [144] [145] He has been recalled to the Test squad after a gap of more than a year against New Zealand starting in the end of August 2012. [146] Harbhajan was dropped from the test team after the 2013 series against Australia.He was called back to the test team after 2 years for a solitary test against Bangladesh .
2015 Inclusion[ edit ]
Following performances in IPL for Mumbai Indians in 2015 and 2014, he was included in the test team captained by Virat Kohli against Bangladesh for the one-off test match in Fatullah. He took 3 wickets in that test to overtake Wasim Akram in the list of most test match wickets to become the ninth highest wicket-taker in Tests. [147] He was then called up for the ODI and T20I teams when a second-string Indian side toured Zimbabwe to play 3 One-day and 2 Twenty-20 matches. Though he did not take many wickets in that tour, he was impressive maintaining a tight line and stopping the flow of runs. Harbhajan returned with figures of 2/29( in 4 overs) in his first T20 international over two and a half years. Currently he is in the squad for the 3 test away series against Sri Lanka led by Virat Kohli. This series will be very crucial for Harbhajan and his career.

Main page: Portal:Contents
Many visitors come to Wikipedia to acquire knowledge, while others come to share knowledge. At this very instant, dozens of articles are being improved, and new articles are also being created. Changes can be viewed at the Recent changes page and a random page at random articles . Over 4,500 articles have been designated by the Wikipedia community as featured articles , exemplifying the best articles in the encyclopedia. Another 22,000 articles are designated as good articles . Some information on Wikipedia is organized into lists ; the best of these are designated as featured lists . Wikipedia also has portals , which organize content around topic areas; our best portals are selected as featured portals . Articles can be found using the search box on the top-right side of the screen.
Wikipedia is available in languages other than English. Wikipedia has more than two hundred and eighty languages , including a Simple English version, and related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and scientific reference sources, and a news service (see sister projects ). All of these are maintained, updated, and managed by separate communities, and often include information and articles that can be hard to find through other common sources.
Basic navigation in Wikipedia
Main page: Help:Navigation
Wikipedia articles are all linked , or cross-referenced. When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information. Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead. There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external websites and pages, reference material, and organized categories of knowledge which can be searched and traversed in a loose hierarchy for more information. Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages, and further information available on our sister projects . Additional links can be easily made if a relevant link is missing—this is one simple way to contribute.
Using Wikipedia as a research tool
Main pages: Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia and Wikipedia:Citing Wikipedia
As wiki documents, articles are never considered complete and may be continually edited and improved. Over time, this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation of information.
Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start: they may contain false or debatable information. Indeed, many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argument, they gradually take on a neutral point of view reached through consensus . Others may, for a while, become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time—months or years perhaps—to achieve better balanced coverage of their subject. In part, this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article that they edit comprehensive. However, eventually, additional editors expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage. In addition, Wikipedia operates a number of internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach. Usually, editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article.
The ideal Wikipedia article is well written, balanced, neutral , and encyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable, verifiable knowledge. An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have. Our best articles are called Featured Articles (and display a small star in the upper right corner of the article), and our second best tier of articles are designated Good Articles . However, this is a process and can take months or years to be achieved through the concerted effort of editors. Some articles contain statements which have not yet been fully cited . Others will later be augmented with new sections. Some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded and, therefore, may be removed.
While the overall trend is toward improvement, it is important to use Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source, since individual articles will, by their nature, vary in quality and maturity. Guidelines and information pages are available to help users and researchers do this effectively, as is an article that summarizes third-party studies and assessments of the reliability of Wikipedia .
Wikipedia vs paper encyclopedias
Main article: Wiki is not paper , on Wikimedia Meta-Wiki .
Wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias. Wikipedia has a very low "publishing" cost for adding or expanding entries and a low environmental impact in some respects , since it never needs to be printed, although computers have their own environmental cost . In addition, Wikipedia has wikilinks instead of in-line explanations and it incorporates overview summaries (article introductions) with the extensive detail of full articles. Additioninters also support PostScript, but most PostScript printers do not support direct PDF printing.
The Free Software Foundation once considered one of their high priority projects to be "developing a free, high-quality and fully functional set of libraries and programs that implement the PDF file format and associated technologies to the ISO 32000 standard." [111] [112] In 2011, however, the GNU PDF project was removed from the list of "high priority projects" due to the maturation of the Poppler library , [113] which has enjoyed wider use in applications such as Evince with the GNOME desktop environment. Poppler is based on Xpdf [114] [115] code base. There are also commercial development libraries available as listed in List of PDF software .
The Apache PDFBox project of the Apache Software Foundation is an open source Java library for working with PDF documents. PDFBox is licensed under the Apache License . [116]



Tips for creating great books
Topic and title
There are almost no limits when creating books from Wikipedia content. A good book focuses on a certain topic and covers it as well as possible. A meaningful title helps other users to have the correct expectation regarding the content of a book.
Length
Books should have a reasonable number of articles. One article is not enough, but books that result in PDFs with more than 500 pages are probably too big, and may even cause problems on older computers.
Be bold
If your book has a clear focus, meaningful title and is a reasonable size, consider adding it to the list of community books. You can either save it directly to Book:Title, or move it there from your userspace.
Step-by-step guide
This page shows you how to create a book from Wikipedia articles in four easy steps. Books can be created in PDF or OpenDocument formats, or ordered for printing on the PediaPress website. It is possible to create books through editing as well.
Step 1: Enable the "Book Creator" tool
Fig. 1: First click on the "Create a book" link in the left margin. (Maybe you have to open the "Print/export" box first.)
Fig. 2: Click on the green button to start the book creator.
Step 2: Collect articles
Fig. 3: From now on, this toolbar will appear on top of every Wikipedia article. To add the currently viewed page to your book, just click on "Add this page to your book".
If you open a category page, the "Add this page to your book" will change to "Add this category to your book". Clicking on "Add this category to your book" will add all articles in that category.
After selecting a few articles, you can click on "Suggest pages" and you will be presented with a list of articles related to your selection. This helps you to create a more complete book if you run out of ideas, or just want to make sure you haven't forgotten anything.
Fig. 4: You don't even have to open every page, you want to add to your book. Just hover over a link for a few seconds and click on "Add linked wiki page to your book" in the yellow box that appears.
Step 3: Review Your Book
Fig. 5: Once you are happy with the articles you collected, click on "Show book" to manage your book. You can give your book a title and subtitle, change the order of articles, remove articles, or add chapters to distinguish certain sections of your book.
Step 4: Download or order a printed book
Fig. 6: As of November 2014, you can only download your book in PDF format. This screenshot is obsolete.
Fig. 7: To order a printed book, click on "Preview with PediaPress". Further information about printed books can be found in the FAQ .
Saving and sharing your book with others
To save your book, you must be a registered Wikipedia user (see Why create an account? for a detailed explanation).
You can save your book on the "Book" page, which can be reached by clicking the "Show book" link in the menu on the left hand side or in the toolbar. In the "Save and share your book" section you have to choose whether you want to save your book
in the "community-maintained" Books namespace .
The second option is only available if your user account is autoconfirmed (usually meaning at least four days old and 10 edits).
Finally, you have to provide a title for your book collection and click the "Save book" button.
Revising your book
If you visit a previously saved book, the banner at the top of the page includes an option to re-open the book in the "Book Creator".
Books you have worked on will be listed in your contributions list , which you can access through the "Contributions" link at the top right of every page whenever you are logged in.

In their opinion ODF is free of legal encumbrances that would prevent its use in free and open source software, as distributed under licenses authored by Apache and the FSF.
Support for OpenDocument[ edit ]
Several governments, companies, organizations and software products support the OpenDocument format. For example:
The OpenDoc Society run frequent Plugfests in association with industry groups and Public Sector organisations. The 10th Plugfest [52] was hosted by the UK Government Digital Service in conjunction with industry associations including the OpenForum Europe and the Open Source Consortium .
An output of the 10th Plugfest was an ODF toolkit [53] which includes "Open Document Format principles for Government Technology" that has then group stage and beating Malaysia in the semi-final by 8 runs [41] but lost the final against an ODI team Afghanistan by 95 runs and finished runners-up. [42] Nepal came third in 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Four , thus remaining in Division Four for 2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Four . [43] In November, Nepal appeared in 2010 Asian Games and lost against Sri Lanka in the quarter-final. [44] It was the first match Nepal had played against a Full Member nation.
In December 2011, Nepal hosted the 2011 ACC Twenty20 Cup and finished fourth, thereby qualifying for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier . [45]
Nepal finished seventh in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier after defeating Kenya [46] and Papua New Guinea [47] in play-offs. Shakti Gauchan took the first international hat-trick for Nepal against Denmark in the tournament. [48] In September 2012, Nepal appeared in 2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Four , where Subash Khakurel and Anil Mandal both scored century. Subash Khakurel scored 115 off 142 balls against United States [49] and Anil Mandal scored 113 off 134 balls against Denmark . [50] In a match against Malaysia , Shakti Gauchan set up Nepal's convincing victory with a new record. The left-arm orthodox spinner's figures of 10-8-2-3 is the best economical bowling spell ever in limited over encounters. [51] [52] Nepal won all the six matches of the tournament and progressed to 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three . Nepalese players won man of the match awards in all the six matches Nepal played and Basanta Regmi won the player of the tournament award after taking a total of 21 wickets in the tournament. [53] In October, Nepal competed in 2012 ACC Trophy Elite and had to share the trophy with the UAE after a thrilling tied final in Sharjah Cricket Stadium , UAE on 12 October 2012. UAE posted 241, a target that looked in Nepal's sight after their 94-run opening stand. However, they lost wickets consistently, and eventually needed 12 off the last over with just two wickets in hand. Shakti Gauchan smacked Shadeep Silva 's left-arm for a six, but could manage only one run off the last ball, hence ending a splendid final match in a tie. [54] Skipper Paras Khadka scored an unbeaten 106 off just 77 balls against Kuwait , his maiden century for Nepal, in the tournament. [55]
Nepal competed in 2013 ACC Twenty20 Cup held at home grounds in Kirtipur and Lalitpur . Nepal easily marched towards the final of the tournament with high class performance from their captain, Paras Khadka , and the team thrashed the UAE by 6 wickets. [56] Nepal had earlier qualified for 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier , reaching the semi-final of the tournament. Nepal had to be satisfied with runners-up status after losing to an ODI team Afghanistan by 7 wickets. [57] The Nepalese team was supported by a huge fan following throughout this tournament with an average turnout of 15,000 - 20,000 (about 25,000 in the semi-final and final) during their matches while hundreds of thousands watched live on television – undoubtedly the largest public support outside the Test-playing nations. [58] Nepal won the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three held in Bermuda and qualified for the 2014 World Cup Qualifier . [59] Nepal also played in 2013 ACC Emerging Teams Cup , where under-23 age level teams of the four Test nations – Bangladesh , India , Pakistan and Sri Lanka took part along with the UAE , Afghanistan and the hosts Singapore . [60] Nepal finished third in 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier held in UAE [61] and qualified for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 , defeating Hong Kong off the last ball of the thrilling quarter-final. [62]
2015 – present[ edit ]
Nepal finished fourth in the 2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two in Namibia [78] and qualified for the 2015–17 ICC World Cricket League Championship . [79] But Nepal failed to secure promotion to Division One and qualification to 2015–17 ICC Intercontinental Cup after finishing third in the round-robin stage. [80] [81] Basanta Regmi became the first bowler to take 100 wickets in the World Cricket League . He achieved this feat after taking 2 wickets against Netherlands in the tournament. [82] On 11 April 2015, Nepal hosted a 63-over (31.3 overs per side) tribute match in honour of the Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes who was batting on 63 when he was struck by a bouncer. The match was played at the TU Cricket Ground , Kirtipur between Team Red, combined of players of Nepal and Australia and Team Blue, composed of all Nepalese players. [83] In June, Nepal toured Netherlands to play a Twenty20 International series against the home team. Then Nepal appeared in the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier held in Ireland and Scotland , where they finished seventh in the Group A, [84] thus failing to qualify for the second consecutive ICC World Twenty20 . [85]



History[ edit ]
First World Cup[ edit ]
Women's international cricket was first played in 1934, when a party from England toured Australia and New Zealand. The first Test match was played on 28–31 December 1934, and was won by England. [1] The first Test against New Zealand followed early the following year. These three nations remained the only Test playing teams in women's cricket until 1960, when South Africa played a number of matches against England. [1] Limited overs cricket was first played by first-class teams in England in 1962. [2] Nine years later, the first international one day match was played in men's cricket, when England took on Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . [3]
Talks began in 1971 about holding a World Cup for women's cricket, led by Jack Hayward . [4] South Africa, under pressure from the world for their apartheid laws, were not invited to take part in the competition. [5] Both of the other two Test playing nations, Australia and New Zealand were invited. Hayward had previously organised tours of the West Indies by England women, and it was from this region that the other two competing nations were drawn; Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago . To make up the numbers, England also fielded a " Young England " team, and an " International XI " was also included. [4] Five South Africans were invited to play for the International XI as a means of compensation for the team not being invited, but these invitations were later withdrawn. [5]
The inaugural tournament was held at a variety of venues across England in June and July 1973, [6] two years before the first men's Cricket World Cup was played. [7] The competition was played as a round-robin tournament, and the last scheduled match was England against Australia. Australia went into the game leading the table by a solitary point: they had won four matches and had one abandoned. England had also won four matches, but they had lost to New Zealand. [6] [8] As a result, the match also served as a de facto final for the competition. England won the match, held at Edgbaston , Birmingham by 92 runs to win the tournament. [9]



Bids[ edit ]
The ICC announced the hosts for the previous World Cup, the 2011 competition , on 30 April 2006. Australia and New Zealand had also bid for the tournament and a successful Australasian bid for the 2011 World Cup would have seen a 50–50 split in games, with the final still up for negotiation. The Trans-Tasman bid, Beyond Boundaries, was the only bid for 2011 delivered to the ICC headquarters at Dubai before the 1 March deadline. Considerable merits of the bid included the superior venues and infrastructure, and the total support of the Australian and New Zealand governments on tax and custom issues during the tournament, according to Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland . [8] The New Zealand government had also assured that the Zimbabwean team would be allowed to take part in the tournament after political discussions about whether their team would be allowed to tour Zimbabwe in 2005 . [9]
ICC President Ehsan Mani said that the extra time required by the Asian bloc to hand over its bid had harmed the four-nation bid. However, when it came to the voting, the Asians won by seven votes to four; accoheir own match lists and allocating a strictly unofficial first-class status to the matches they consider to have been of a high standard. It is therefore a matter of opinion only with no official support. Inevitable differences have arisen and there are variations in published first-class statistics .
A key issue for the statisticians is when first-class cricket for their purpose is deemed to have begun. Writing in 1951, Roy Webber argued that the majority of matches prior to 1864 (i.e., the year in which overarm bowling was legalised) "cannot be regarded as first-class" and their records are used "for their historical associations". [7] This drew a line between what was important historically and what should form part of the statistical record. Hence, for pre-1895 (i.e., in Great Britain) cricket matches, "first-class" is essentially a statistical concept while the historical concept is broader and takes account of historical significance. Webber's rationale was that cricket was "generally weak before 1864" (there was a greater and increasingly more organised effort to promote county cricket from about that time) and match details were largely incomplete, especially bowling analyses, which hindered compilation of records. [7] According to Webber's view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1864 season between Cambridge University and MCC at Fenner's on 12 and 13 May, Cambridge winning by 6 wickets. [8] When the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS) published its Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles in 1982, it tentatively agreed with Webber's 1864 start date by saying that "the line between first-class and other matches becomes more easily discernible about that date". [9] A year earlier, the ACS had published its Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 – 1863 in which it listed all the known matches during that period which it considered to have historical importance. They did stipulate that they had taken a more lenient view of importance re matches played in the 18th century than they did of matches played in the 19th century. As they explained, surviving details of 18th century matches are typically incomplete while there is a fairly comprehensive store of data about 19th century matches. [10]
Subsequently, Webber's view has been challenged by those who suggest earlier dates for the commencement of "first-class statistics". Bill Frindall believed that 1815 should be the start to encompass the entire roundarm bowling phase of cricket's history. However, roundarm did not begin in earnest until 1827. In Frindall's view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1815 season between MCC and Middlesex at Lord's on 31 May and 1 June, Middlesex winning by 16 runs. [11] The most significant internet-based views are those of CricketArchive (CA) and ESPNcricinfo (CI), both of which hold that the earliest first-class match was Hampshire versus All-England at Broadhalfpenny Down on 24 and 25 June 1772. CA has numbered this match "f1" (i.e., first-class match number one) and CI as "First-Class # 1". [12] [13]
However commendable these views may be, they are not only unofficial but also entirely statistical. The 1772 match left a scorecard that is complete apart from the bowling analyses and so the data is sufficient for a statistical study, especially as the scorecard was itself the start of a trend and there are surviving scorecards from every season commencing 1772. The historical view centres on the historical significance of a match and its known contemporary importance measured by, as is often the case with early matches, the amount of money at stake. Other factors are the size of the crowd, if known, and the fact that a match was deemed notable enough to be reported in the press. The earliest match known to have been accorded superior status in a contemporary report (i.e., "a great match" in this case) and to have been played for a large sum of money was one in Sussex between two unnamed eleven-a-side teams contesting "fifty guineas apiece" in June 1697. [14] This major cricket match has enormous historical significance but has no value at all for statisticians as there is no surviving data.



History[ edit ]
Cricket at the Oval began in 1882 when the Pickwick Cricket Club assumed formal ownership of the ground. [4] The first international match held was in 1895 when Slade Lucas' side visited the island. The first Test match was held in January 1930, when the West Indies and England played to a draw. Since the genesis there have been a total of 43 Test matches played on the Kensington Oval grounds, 21 of those matches won by the West Indian cricket team . The new stadium has been commemorated through two 2007 Barbadian postage stamps . [5]
Oval Redevelopment 2005–2007[ edit ]
Structures and facilities[ edit ]
The stands of the Kensington Oval were extensively rebuilt for the 2007 Cricket World Cup in a BDS$ 90M ( US$ 45 Million) redevelopment. [6] Demolition of the old stadium began on schedule in June, 2005 after completion of the first Test against Pakistan . The names of the former stands which made up the Kensington stadium were the George Challenor stand, the Hall and Griffith, the Kensington, the Mitchie Hewitt, the Pickwick, and the Three Ws stand plus the Peter Short Media Centre. Most of these names have been retained. [7]
Outfield[ edit ]
In 2004, the STRI construction team were chosen to redevelop the Kensington Oval outfield, after they were previously involved with the Lord's Cricket Ground outfield reconstruction. The topsoil on the grounds previous outfield was a sandy clay loam, which struggled to cope with Bridgetown's occasional heavy rainfall, with climate data indicating that a storm lasting up to an hour could dump about 50mm of rain once every five years. The topsoil was a complete mixture of soils and significantly varied in depth, lying over ancient coral reef limestone.
The new outfield consists of; 175mm of amended root-zone, 125mm of unamended root-zone sand , a 50mm blinding layer and a 100mm gravel drainage layer. Although many types of grass options was suggested to be used for the outfield, it was decided to use Tifway 419 hybrid Bermuda grass as this type of grass is highly disease resistant, dense and spreads quickly to ensure quick recovery from injury and allows close mowing. [8] The Cricket pitch was reconstructed with four main pitches and a profile consisting of; 200mm of clay , over 150mm of medium-fine sand along with a gravel drainage layer. The square's soil is made up of 71% clay, 14% silt and 14% sand and during the redevelopment it was isolated from the rest of the ground so that it could be constructed before the outfield was completed. The pitch square's was sown down with Princess Bermuda grass , with the base and soil added in layers, before completion in May 2006. [9]
Events[ edit ]
The Kensington Oval has also hosted many non-cricket events such as matches of the Barbados national football team , hockey, inter-school athletics, Miss Barbados pageants, and concert events. The ground also has a jumbo TV screen and also a jacuzzi type area, for fans to watch while relaxing in the pool (similar to Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona ). Behind this is a large grassy hill for fans to have picnics on, which has a bunker underneath for the media .
On 5 August 2011 Rihanna performed at the Kensington Oval for the first time in her home country on her Loud Tour . She planned another show for 1 November 2013 as a part her Diamonds World Tour , however the concert was cancelled due to technical difficulties.

History[ edit ]
The South African cricket team toured England in 1947. At Nottingham , Captain Alan Melville and vice-captain , Dudley Nourse achieved a Test match record for a third wicket partnership of 319. The following year Nourse, 38-year-old captain of Natal , was appointed Captain for the 1948 MCC Test matches in South Africa. [6]
In 1970 , the ICC voted to suspend South Africa from international cricket indefinitely because of its government's policy of apartheid , a policy which led them to play only against the white nations (England, Australia, New Zealand), and field only white players. This decision excluded players such as Graeme Pollock , Barry Richards and Mike Procter from partaking in international Test Cricket. It would also cause the emigration of future stars like Allan Lamb and Robin Smith , who both played for England, and Kepler Wessels , who initially played for Australia, before returning to South Africa.
The South African team at The Oval in August 2008.
The ICC reinstated South Africa as a Test nation in 1991 after the deconstruction of apartheid, and the team played its first sanctioned match since 1970 (and its first ever One-Day International) against India in Calcutta on 10 November 1991. South Africa's first test match after re-admission was against the West Indies in April 1992. The match was played in Bridgetown, Barbados and South Africa lost by 52 runs.
Since South Africa have been reinstated they have achieved mixed success, and hosted the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup in 2003. However, it is widely believed [7] the sides containing the likes of Allan Donald , Shaun Pollock , Gary Kirsten and Hansie Cronje grossly underachieved, gaining a reputation as " chokers ", due to them reaching the semi-finals of the Cricket World Cup three times, but failing to progress into the finals. In the second part of the 1990s, South Africa had the highest winning percentage in ODIs of any team, but they were knocked out of the 1996 World Cup in the quarter-finals , and then were eliminated on countback after tying their semi-final against Australia in 1999. In 2003, South Africa were one of the favourites but were eliminated by one run in the group stages after they had mistakenly counted the number of runs they needed.
They have also had bad press for failing in vital matches in global tournaments including the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy and the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 . [8]
With Donald retiring, Cronje banned for match-fixing and later killed in a plane crash , and Pollock also retiring from international cricket, the team once again changed shape. Graeme Smith was made captain, although following injuries to Smith and Jacques Kallis , Ashwell Prince deputised as Test captain on 12 July 2006. At the age of 29, he became the first non-white man to captain the once all-white South African cricket team. Due to a racial quota policy, the side was once required to contain black players, unlike the past. However, that policy was rescinded in 2007. [9]
After many of the major players in the Australian side that had dominated the early 2000s had retired, the number one place in the ICC Test Championship was a wide open race, with India and England having short stints as the number one side. South Africa toured England in 2012 for a three Test series with the winner assured of being the world number one. South Africa went on to take the series comfortably 2–0 and claim the top spot in the rankings, a position they have held onto for over a full calendar year. [10]
During this time of dominance in the Test arena, the ODI and T20I performances were far less consistent, as South Africa search for a winning formula ahead of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup . A notable ODI series loss to New Zealand at home in January 2013, and a further loss in Sri Lanka highlighted South Africa's recent difficulties. Exits from the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy only served to improve South Africa's reputation as 'chokers' in major tournaments. In the latter years of Smith's career, South Africa split the captaincy in the shorter forms of the game, with the ODI side being led by AB de Villiers and the T20I side by Faf du Plessis . After Smith's retirement, Hashim Amla was appointed captain of the test side, leading his side to victory in his first test in charge, in Galle in Sri Lanka .
Choking reputation[ edit ]
The South African cricket team has gained a reputation as a frequent choker at global cricket tournaments conducted by the International Cricket Council . Despite being consistently one of the best-performing nations in all forms of cricket since its return from isolation , the Proteas have never progressed beyond the semi-final stage at a World Cup. This reputation was further cemented by the fact that South Africa had never won a game during the knock-out stage of the World Cup; a record which was broken in the quarter-finals of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, when they won against highly rated Sri Lanka. [11] [12]
This reputation arises largely from two events:
In the 1999 Super Six Stage , Herschelle Gibbs dropped eventual centurion Steve Waugh after which Australia went on to win the match, [13] then a shambolic run-out involving Allan Donald and Lance Klusener in the semi-final also against Australia ended South Africa's second innings with the scores tied. Australia progressed on the basis of its superior run rate through the tournament.
In the Proteas' final game of Cricket World Cup 2003's group stage (which was effectively a knock-out match, as they had to win to progress to the Super Six ), South Africa tied the rain-affected game against Sri Lanka which they could have won, after they misinterpreted the Duckworth-Lewis rain rule tables shortly before the match was called off.
In addition to surrendering commanding positions in the above matches, South Africa suffered upset losses against the West Indies in 1996 and New Zealand in 2011 . [14] South Africa's win in the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy remains their only international tournament victory to date. In the 2015 World Cup semi finals against New Zealand, the South Africans batted first, however as a result of a rain interruption the game was halted. New Zealand who were set a Duckworth-Lewis score of 298, chased it down. South Africa lost the game marginally as they missed two run outs and two catches.

India in West Indies 2011 May 31, 2011
Opportunity for fringe players - Raina

The tour of the West Indies will be a test for India's stand-in captain Suresh Raina and new coach Duncan Fletcher © AFP
The absence of several senior players for the upcoming tour of the West Indies provides an ideal platform for fringe players to shine on the international stage, Suresh Raina , India's captain for the limited-overs leg of the Caribbean tour, has said.
"It's a great opportunity for the youngsters who have done well in domestic cricket," Raina told the media ahead of the team's departure for the West Indies. "I am happy with the side, as we have some very good batsmen in Rohit Sharma, Manoj Tiwary, S Badrinath and Shikhar Dhawan, all of whom have done well in first-class cricket."
Raina, has led a similarly second-string Indian side in the past, for a tri-series Zimbabwe in May-June 2010, though India performed poorly on that tour, losing both matches against the hosts and one against Sri Lanka.
This time, India are without the services of Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni and Zaheer Khan, who have all been rested, in addition to the ill Yuvraj Singh, and the injured duo of Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir for the lone Twenty20 and the five ODIs that follow. MS Dhoni will take over the captaincy from Raina for the Tests, and Zaheer will return, but the other seniors will miss the Test leg as well.
Raina said he has learnt a lot about the art of captaincy from Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid and Dhoni, and was prepared for the challenge.
"West Indies have players like Gayle missing, but it will be a challenge for us," Raina said. "There's always pressure and we have done well under pressure. It's for us as players to execute the plans of the coach well. We have to play our natural game."
The tour will be the first assignment for India's neକ୍ଷିଣଆଫ୍ରିକା ଦଳ ବିପକ୍ଷରେ ହେବାକୁ ଥିବା ଖେଳ ପାଇଁ ଭାରତୀୟ ଜାତୀୟ ଦଳ ପକ୍ଷରୁ ଚୟନ ହୋଇଥିଲେ । ୨୦୧୧ରେ ସେ ବିଶ୍ଵର ପଞ୍ଚମ ଶ୍ରେଷ୍ଠ କନିଷ୍ଠ ଖେଳାଳି ଭାବରେ ୧୦୦ଟି ଟେଷ୍ଟ ୱିକେଟ ନେଇଥିଲେ ।

Ishant Sharma (
( help · info )
; born 2 September 1988) is an Indian cricketer who has represented India in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He is a 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in) tall [1] [2] [3] right-arm fast-medium bowler. [4]
At the age of 18, Sharma was called to join the Indian squad for the tour of South Africa in 2006–07 . However, after receiving the call and organising travel arrangements, it was decided not to send him on the tour. [5] In reference to his height and lean physique in his Under-19 days, the bowler was nicknamed Lambu. [6] [7] In 2011, he became the fifth youngest player to take 100 Test wickets. Against South Africa in 2013, Ishant Sharma became the fifth quickest Indian to grab 100 ODI wickets. [8] While being a "rhythm" bowler, he still is considered one of the fastest Indian bowlers having bowled in excess of 150 km/h on several occasions in international cricket as well as the IPL, his fastest being 152 km/h.
Domestic and first-class career
Ishant plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and has taken 68 wickets in 14  first-class games, [9] [10] including a five-wicket haul against Baroda on the opening day of a match Delhi drew after failing to bowl Baroda out on the fourth day. [11]
Ishant toured England with the India Under-19s in 2006 and Pakistan in 2006–07. He played three youth tests and six youth One Day Internationals for India. On the basis of his strong performance in Australia in 2008, Ishant Sharma was bought for a winning bid of $950,000 by Kolkata Knight Riders in the player auction for the Indian Premier League . This was the highest amount paid for any bowler in tournament.
International career
Ishant Sharma in 2008
In May 2007, Sharma was selected in the test team for the Bangladesh tour and played as a replacement for the fast bowler Munaf Patel . Over there he played for his national side in the second test where he bowled three overs including one maiden and conceded only five runs without taking a wicket. [12] Later on, he was called for the tour of England in July–August 2007.
Sharma got a call back in the team in the 3rd Test during Pakistan's tour of India in December 2007 due to injury of India's frontline pacers Zaheer Khan , RP Singh , and Sreesanth . [13] Sharma picked up 5 wickets during the third test in Bangalore . [14] This performance earned him a place in India's squad for the tour of Australia.
Sharma was left out in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne during the Border–Gavaskar Trophy as India retained their main fast bowlers, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh. However, in January 2008 Sharma was called to represent India once again to replace the injured Zaheer Khan in the second test at the SCG . Sharma started the first day of the match strongly and was involved in a controversial decision from Steve Bucknor when Andrew Symonds nicked the ball to keeper MS Dhoni off his bowling but was given not out. He bowled reasonably in the match, however without much luck.
Although he had little success, the management retained him for the third Test match at Perth. On the fourth day of the match he bowled an exceptional spell to Australian captain Ricky Ponting that resulted in his wicket and helped India claim victory. [15] He used the pace and bounce of the WACA wicket to trouble the batsmen. In the following test played in Adelaide he picked up two wickets and impressed everyone with his bowling. He finished the tour of Australia with figures of 6/358, an average of 59.66 and a strike rate of 101.0. [16]
On 10 February 2008, Sharma bagged four important wickets in the 4th ODI of CB Series against Australia. He ended the match with figures of 4/38 and named Man of the Match. [17] He scalped two important wickets on 18 February 2008 versus Australia in the 7th ODI of CB series. [18]
During the 2008 Test series against Australia in India , Ishant was the leading wicket-taker, with 16, and was named man-of-the-series as India won 2–0. He thereby became the first Indian paceman to win such an award in a Test series on Indian soil after Kapil Dev who won the award in 1983. He was noted for achieving reverse swing on balls sometimes as young as eight overs, and along with senior opening bowler Zaheer Khan, troubled the touring Australians. [19] He took Australian captain Ricky Ponting's wicket three times during the series, and six times in as many Tests, making the Indian press label Ponting as Ishant's bunny. [20]
However, in 2009, Ishant's form slumped, and he was dropped for the second Test against Sri Lanka, replaced by Sreesanth .
On 5 October 2010, Ishant helped VVS Laxman pull off a highly unlikely win over Australia by one wicket in the first Test in Mohali after India had fallen to 8/124 in pursuit of 205. Ishant provided Laxman with support during an 81-run partnership in which he contributed 31 valuable runs.
Sharma bowling in the nets in 2008
In the 2011 IPL auction, Sharma was bought by the Deccan Chargers ; he hoped that his performance in the competition would give him a chance to impress selectors and push for selection in India's ODI team. [21] From 12 matches, Sharma took 11 wickets at an average of 28.54. [22] A month after the IPL, which was held in April and May, India toured the West Indies for five ODIs and three Tests . Several senior players were rested from the ODI side and others absent through injury; this mostly affected the batsmen but Zaheer Khan missed the ODI series. [23] India won the first three ODIs, and Sharma was called into the team for the fourth, his first ODI since August 2010. [24] [25] He managed one wicket from two matches in the series while conceding 109 runs. [26] The first Test resulted in a win for India and Sharma took three wickets in each innings. [27] He claimed his 100th Test wicket in the second Test, becoming the fifth youngest to reach thally, the editorial cycle is short. A paper encyclopedia stays the same until the next edition, whereas editors can update Wikipedia at any instant, around the clock, keeping articles abreast of the most recent events and scholarship.
Strengths, weaknesses, and article quality in Wikipedia
See also: Reliability of Wikipedia and Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia
Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences all arise because it is open to anyone, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are written by consensus, according to editorial guidelines and policies.
Wikipedia is open to a large contributor base, drawing a large number of editors from diverse backgrounds. This allows Wikipedia to significantly reduce regional and cultural bias found in many other publications, and makes it very difficult for any group to censor and impose bias . A large, diverse editor base also provides access and breadth on subject matter that is otherwise inaccessible or little documented. A large number of editors contributing at any moment also means that Wikipedia can produce encyclopedic articles and resources covering newsworthy events within hours or days of their occurrence. It also means that like any publication, Wikipedia may reflect the cultural, age, socio-economic, and other biases of its contributors. There is no systematic process to make sure that "obviously important" topics are written about, so Wikipedia may contain unexpected oversights and omissions. While most articles may be altered by anyone, in practice editing will be performed by a certain demographic (younger rather than older, male rather than female, rich enough to afford a computer rather than poor, et cetera) and may, therefore, show some bias. Some topics may not be covered well, while others may be covered in great depth.
Allowing anyone to edit Wikipedia means that it is more easily vandalized or susceptible to unchecked information, which requires removal. See Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism . While blatant vandalism is usually easily spotted and rapidly corrected, Wikipedia is more subject to subtle viewpoint promotion than a typical reference work. However, bias that would be unchallenged in a traditional reference work is likely to be ultimately challenged or considered on Wikipedia. While Wikipedia articles generally attain a good standard after editing, it is important to note that fledgling articles and those monitored less well may be susceptible to vandalism and insertion of false information. Wikipedia's radical openness also means that any given article may be, at any given moment, in a bad state, such as in the middle of a large edit, or a controversial rewrite. Many contributors do not yet comply fully with key policies , or may add information without citable sources. Wikipedia's open approach tremendously increases the chances that any particular factual error or misleading statement will be relatively promptly corrected. Numerous editors at any given time are monitoring recent changes and edits to articles on their watchlists .
Wikipedia is written by open and transparent consensus—an approach that has its pros and cons. Censorship or imposing "official" points of view is extremely difficult to achieve and usually fails after a time. Eventually for most articles, all notable views become fairly described and a neutral point of view reached. In reality, the process of reaching consensus may be long and drawn-out, with articles fluid or changeable for a long time while they find their "neutral approach" that all sides can agree on. Reaching neutrality is occasionally made harder by extreme-viewpoint contributors . Wikipedia operates a full editorial dispute resolution process, one that allows time for discussion and resolution in depth, but one that also permits disagreements to last for months before poor-quality or biased edits are removed. A common conclusion is that Wikipedia is a valuable resource and provides a good reference point on its subjects.
That said, articles and subject areas sometimes suffer from significant omissions, and while misinformation and vandalism are usually corrected quickly, this does not always happen. (See for example this incident in which a person inserted a fake biography linking a prominent journalist to the Kennedy assassinations and Soviet Russia as a joke on a co-worker which went undetected for four months, saying afterwards he "didn’t know Wikipedia was used as a serious reference tool".)
Wikipedia is written largely by amateurs. Those with expert credentials are given no additional weight. Wikipedia is also not subject to any peer review for scientific, medical or engineering articles. One advantage to having amateurs write in Wikipedia is that they have more free time on their hands so that they can make rapid changes in response to current events. The wider the general public interest in a topic, the more likely it is to attract contributions from non-specialists.
The MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes, thus information added to Wikipedia never "vanishes". Discussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics. Therefore, serious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously or thoughtfully advocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article. As with any source, information should be checked. A 2005 editorial by a BBC technology writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of cultural changes that are happening across all sources of information (including search engines and the media), and may lead to "a better sense of how to evaluate information sources".

Career[ edit ]
Pragyan Ojha made his debut in first class cricket in 2004/05 and represented India at the under-19 level as well. He finished the 2006–07 Ranji Trophy season with 29 wickets with an impressive average of 19.89 in just 6 games. The left arm spinner is known for his ability to flight the ball. He is the only Hyderabadi to have played in all three formats of the game for India.
His earliest pursuit in cricket was at the age of 10, when he went to Sahid Sporting Club for a summer camp in Bhubaneswar under Sasang S Das, while studying at D.A.V Public School in Chandrasekharpur . Three years later, he moved to Bhavan's Sri RamaKrishna Vidyalaya (BSRKV) in Sainikpuri and carried on his cricket coaching under the guidance of T Vijay Paul.
Pragyan Ojha represents Hyderabad Cricket Association in domestic cricket. He has previously played for Deccan Chargers and currently plays for Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. His high success in the first couple of seasons in domestic cricket and the IPL ensured his selection in the 15-man Indian squad for the Bangladesh tour and Asia Cup in 2008.
He played his first One Day International match against Bangladesh on 28 June 2008 in Karachi and ended up with figures of 2/43.
On 24 November 2009, Ojha made his Test debut in the Second Test against Sri Lanka in Kanpur, replacing Amit Mishra and gaining figures of 2/37 off 23 overs and 2/36 off of 15.3 overs in India's 100th Test win. He then took five wickets in the Third Test in another innings win for India, taking nine wickets at 28.66 in two Tests. Ojha became the 800th and final Test victim of Muttiah Muralitharan, the highest wicket-taker in Test history.
In his T20 debut against Bangladesh on 6 June 2009, he took 4/21 in four overs. He was awarded Man of the Match for his outstanding and match-winning performance.
He has performed exceedingly well in the six editions of IPL, earning him the praise of his captain Adam Gilchrist and Sachin Tendulkar. He was all the more successful in the second season, which ensured his selection in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England. IPL 3 he was awarded the Purple Cap for picking up the most number of wickets in the tournament. He has been part of 3 IPL winning teams (1 for Deccan Chargers & 2 for Mumbai Indians) & 1 champions League for Mumbai Indians.
In August, 2011 he signed to play for Surrey for the final few weeks of the 2011 season.[2] His 24 wickets inft Arm Finger Leg spin bowling in the sport of cricket . Left-arm orthodox spin is bowled by a left-arm bowler using the fingers to spin the ball from right to left of the cricket pitch (from the bowler's perspective).
Left arm orthodox spin bowlers generally attempt to drift the ball in the air into a right-handed batsman, and then turn it away from the batsman (towards off-stump) upon landing on the pitch. The drift and turn in the air are attacking techniques. The left-arm orthodox spin like an off break or off spin is also a bowling action.
The major variations of a left-arm spinner are the topspinner (which turns less and bounces higher in the cricket pitch), the arm ball (which does not turn at all, drifts into a right-handed batsman in the direction of the bowler's arm movement; also called a 'floater') and the left-arm spinner's version of a doosra (which turns the other way). The left-arm unorthodox spin like a leg break or leg spin is also a bowling action.

Sponsorship[ edit ]
PepsiCo replaced DLF Ltd as the title sponsor starting with the 2013 season. DLF did not renew their contract after their initial five-year contract, for ₹ 2.50 billion, ended with the previous season. PepsiCo's contract is ₹ 3968 million for five years, ending with the 2017 season. [4] [5] In response to questions about the higher sponsorship costs compared to DLF's, a representative of PepsiCo said, "Our estimate is that we will get five to six times the value of the money we paid." However, Brand Finance had assessed the IPL's brand value to have fallen from $4.1 billion in 2010 to $2.9 billion in 2012, attributed to the decline in television ratings over the two years. [6]
Termination of Deccan Chargers[ edit ]
Main article: Deccan Chargers: Franchise termination
Deccan Chargers , champions of the 2009 Indian Premier League , became the second team to be terminated from the IPL after Kochi Tuskers Kerala . The owners failed to save the team after several attempts were made with the Bombay High Court and Supreme Court of India . Immediately after the Chargers' termination, the BCCI invited bidders for a replacement team also based in Hyderabad . It was announced on 25 October 2012 that Sun TV Network won the bid at ₹ 850.5 million per year. [7] The new team was named the Sunrisers Hyderabad . [8]
Main article: List of 2013 Indian Premier League personnel changes
In October 2012, the teams were allowed to release any number of their players from their contracts to reduce their player costs. The released players would have the option of entering the auction. The players' auction was held on 3 February 2013, [9] where 37 players were sold. [10]
Overseas participation[ edit ]
Availability of Bangladeshi players was put in doubt when the Bangladesh Cricket Board considered not issuing the players with the No Objection Certificates they needed to participate in the tournament. Their deliberation was due to the tournament's dates clashing with the Bangladesh tour of Zimbabwe . [11] Regardless, both affected players, Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal , missed the start of the tournament due to injury.
Despite the progress on the restoration of cricketing relations between India and Pakistan after the Pakistan national cricket team toured India in December 2012 and January 2013, no Pakistani players were included in the auction. [12] [13] Several South Africans missed the start of the tournament to play in the knockout stage of the Ram Slam T20 Challenge . [14] Two New Zealand players were released early by their teams to join the New Zealand tour of England . Both players were not performing for their teams. [15] Sri Lanka Cricket made a similar request to allow some of their players to join their preparations for the ICC Champions Trophy . [16]
Shortly before the start of the season, the IPL governing council ruled that Sri Lankan cricketers and match officials will not participate in any matches held in Chennai . [17] This was a result of the growing political tensions in Tamil Nadu concerning the ethnic conflict between the Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamils . [18] The anti-Sinhalaese sentiments from the people of Tamil Nadu raised security concerns for Sri Lankan involvement. The decision was made after Jayalalithaa , the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, wrote to the Prime Minister of India requesting the ban. [19]
Other than the Chennai Super Kings , the franchises were not in support of the decision as they believed it offered Chennai an added advantage in their home matches. Chennai's Sri Lankan players hold secondary positions in their team while some Sri Lankans in other teams play key roles and their absence in those matches would affect their team strategies. Another concern was with how the decision did not follow the precedence of moving the matches to a different venue. [20] However, the playoff matches originally scheduled to be held in Chennai were later relocated to Delhi. [21]
Opening ceremony[ edit ]
The opening ceremony was held at the largest stadium in India, and the second largest stadium in the world by capacity, the Salt Lake Stadium or Yuva Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata , on 2 April 2013. All nine teams, led by their captains, took the " MCC Spirit of Cricket" pledge. Mamata Banerjee , the Chief Minister of West Bengal , was present at the ceremony. It featured live performances of American rapper Pitbull and Indian film stars Shahrukh Khan , Katrina Kaif and Deepika Padukone . [22] [23] [24]
April[ edit ]
The season began on 3 April with the defending champions the Kolkata Knight Riders defeating the Delhi Daredevils . Kolkata would then struggle and lose five of their next six matches due to good batting performances only coming from captain Gautam Gambhir and Eoin Morgan . [25] Delhi, who topped the group stage in 2012, had a six-match losing streak due to batting failures apart from three half-centuries from captain Mahela Jayawardene and David Warner . [26] Both Delhi and Kolkata were positioned at the bottom of the points table for the first half of the season.
Two-time runners-up the Royal Challengers Bangalore won six of their first eight matches with a six-of-six home record. This was credited to good death-over bowling from Vinay Kumar and prolific and quick run-scoring from captain Virat Kohli , Chris Gayle and AB de Villiers . This included Gayle's score of 175 not out, the highest in Twenty20 cricket. [27] However, their performances were fluctuant. Included was a 130-run victory, two Super Overs and two other matches involving a tight finish. [28] Two-time champions the Chennai Super Kings were similarly dominant, with good batting from captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni , Michael Hussey and Suresh Raina and an all-round bowling attack. [29] They came up with an IPL record-equalling seven-match winning streak, which took them to the top of the points table. [30]
The Mumbai Indians , who made playoff-stage appearances in each of the past three years, were inconsistent with both batting and bowling. Good batting performances from Dinesh Karthik , Rohit Sharma and Kieron Pollard put Mumbai at the middle of the points table halfway through the season. [31] The Sunrisers Hyderabad produced results contrary to the poor performance last season by their predecessors the Deccan Chargers . With no stand-out individual batting performances, Hyderabad managed to win five of their first seven matches. Their strength was in their strong and economical bowling from an attack centred around Dale Steyn and Amit Mishra . Mishra got the second hat-trick of the season, becoming the first to achieve three IPL hat-tricks. [32]
Also at the middle of the points table was the Rajasthan Royals . They won matches with cohesive batting and bowling where different players delivered match-winning contributions. Shane Watson produced scores of 101 and 98 not out while James Faulkner was briefly the season's top wicket-taker after taking 5 for 20. [33] The Pune Warriors India and the Kings XI Punjab continue their form from 2012. Pune won two matches from eight with significant contributions coming only from Aaron Finch , Steve Smith and Bhuvneshwar Kumar . [34] Punjab had average performances with poor contributions from their international players and a dependency on their less-accomplished local players.
May[ edit ]
In the second half of the season, Chennai continued to be dominant and held their number-one position on the points table while Mumbai, Rajasthan, Bangalore and Hyderabad were evenly matched as they switched between the positions of second to fifth. Mumbai excelled to win seven out of eight matches with improved bowling performances around Mitchell Johnson and Pollard producing an unbeaten innings of 66 runs from 27 balls. [35] Rajasthan were also strong and had four consecutive victories and a perfect record at home. Ajinkya Rahane scored three consecutive half-centuries, Sanju Samson made a strong IPL debut and Watson continued his good form. [36]
Bangalore's schedule had them play six consecutive away matches, of which they could only win two due to their bowling attack struggling on away surfaces and repeatedly failures to defend high scores set by Gayle, Kohli and de Villiers. Hyderabad's bowlers continued to perform while their batting was strengthened with the inclusion of Shikhar Dhawan , who returned from injury after scoring the fa purpose of simply explaining the case for ODF directed at the "average civil servant" and includes an extract form the UK Government policy relating to Open Document Format.
The toolkit also includes a single page graphical image [54] designed to articulate the consequences of not choosing Open Document Format. The illustration has now been translated in to more than 10 languages.
Information technology companies like Apple Inc. , Adobe Systems , Google , IBM , Intel , Microsoft , Nokia , Novell , Red Hat , Oracle as well as other companies who may or may not be working inside the OASIS OpenDocument Adoption Technical Committee.
Over 600 companies and organizations promote OpenDocument format through The OpenDocument Format Alliance . [55]
NATO with its 26 members uses ODF as a mandatory standard for all members. [56]
The TAC (Telematics between Administrations Committee), composed of e-government policy-makers from the 25 European Union Member States, endorsed a set of recommendations for promoting the use of open document formats in the public sector. [57]
The free office suites Apache OpenOffice , Calligra , KOffice , NeoOffice and LibreOffice all use OpenDocument as their default file format.
Several organisations, such as the OpenDocument Fellowship and OpenDoc Society were founded to support and promote OpenDocument.
The UK government has adopted ODF as the standard for all documents in the UK civil service [58]
The Wikimedia Foundation supports ODF export from MediaWiki , which powers Wikipedia and a number of other Internet wiki -based sites. [59]
The default text processing applications in Windows 10 ( WordPad ) and Mac OS 10.9 ( TextEdit ) support OpenDocument Text.
On 4 November 2005, IBM and Sun Microsystems convened the "OpenDocument (ODF) Summit" in Armonk, New York , to discuss how to boost OpenDocument adoption. The ODF Summit brought together representatives from several industry groups and technology companies, including Oracle, Google, Adobe, Novell, Red Hat, Computer Associates, Corel, Nokia, Intel, and Linux e-mail company Scalix (LaMonica, 10 November 2005). The providers committed resources to technically improve OpenDocument through existing standards bodies and to promote its usage in the marketplace, possibly through a stand-alone foundation. [60] Scholars have suggested that the "OpenDocument standard is the wedge that can hold open the door for competition, particularly with regard to the specific concerns of the public sector." [61] Indeed, adoption by the public sector has risen considerably since the promulgation of the OpenDocument format initiated the 2005/2006 time period. [61]
Different applications using ODF as a standard document format have different methods of providing macro/scripting capabilities. There is no macro language specified in ODF. Users and developers differ on whether inclusion of a standard scripting language would be desirable. [62]
The ODF specification for tracked changes is limited and does not fully specify all cases, resulting in implementation-specific behaviors. [63] In addition, OpenDocument does not support change tracking in elements like tables or MathML . [64]
It is not permitted to use generic ODF formatting style elements (like font information) for the MathML elements. [64]
Main article: OpenDocument adoption
One objective of open formats like OpenDocument is to guarantee long-term access to data without legal or technical barriers, and some governments have come to view open formats as a public policy issue. Several governments around the world have introduced policies of partial or complete adoption. [61] What this means varies from case to case; in some cases, it means that the ODF standard has a national standard identifier; in some cases, it means that the ODF standard is permitted to be used where national regulation says that non-proprietary formats must be used, and in still other cases, it means that some government body has actually decided that ODF will be used in some specific context.

Further information: Wikipedia:Category names
When naming a category, one should be particularly careful and choose its name accurately. Moving non-conventionally categorized pages to another category name (see {{ Category redirect }}) imposes an additional overhead – an edit for each article and subcategory.
General conventions
Standard article naming conventions apply; in particular, do not capitalize regular nouns except when they come at the beginning of the title.
Names of topic categories should be singular, normally corresponding to the name of a Wikipedia article. Examples: " Law ", " France ", " George W. Bush ".
Names of set categories should be plural. Examples: " Writers ", " Villages in Poland ".
Avoid abbreviations. Example: " Category:Military equipment of World War II ", not ":Category:Military equipment of WW2". However, abbreviations that have become the official or generally used name (such as NATO ) should be used where there are no other conflicts.
Don't write the category structure in names. Example: " Monarchs ", not "People - Monarchs".
Choose category names that can stand alone, independent of the way a category is connected to other categories. Example: " Geography terminology stubs ", not "Terminology" (a subcategory of " Geography stubs ").
As with lists , avoid descriptive adjectives such as famous, important, or notable in category titles.
Particularly for technical subjects, use words and phrases which exist in reliable sources, so that those sources may be used to support inclusion of articles.
Special conventions
Note that in many instances a topic category and a set category have similar names, the topic category being singular and the set category plural. For example, Opera is a topic category (containing all articles relating to the topic), while Operas is a set category (containing articles about specific operas). Be careful to choose the right one when categorizing articles.
If there are a lot of lists in a particular subject area, it may be useful to have a category to hold them, called something like " Category:Lists of countries ". These categories should only contain list pages (for example " List of Soviet Republics ", " List of countries by population "). When placing pages in such a category, use a sort key that excludes the phrase "List of" (otherwise all lists would appear under "L"). See also Category:Lists .
All WikiProject categories should have "WikiProject" (or "WikiProjects") as part of the name. Note that this does not apply to the names of categories that projects might create for the use of assessments. In these cases, the advice given in Project Categories , which conforms to Category:Wikipedia 1.0 assessments is advised, though not mandatory.
Categories used for Wikipedia administration are prefixed with the word "Wikipedia" (no colon) if this is needed to prevent confusion with content categories. For example, Category:Inactive project pages (where no confusion is likely), but Category:Wikipedia tools (as distinctstest Test-debut hundred two months ago, [37] and Darren Sammy . [38] Bangalore and Hyderabad slowly fell behind Mumbai and Rajasthan in the points table, allowing a chance for other teams.
Delhi and Pune failed to recover from their poor starts to the season and were the first to be eliminated from the tournament, similar to their performances in 2011 . [39] Punjab's form deteriorated as they faced teams at the top-half of the points table, with only Shaun Marsh and David Miller making significant batting contributions. [40] Kolkata showed signs of improvement as their bowlers limited the opposition to low scores but this only lifted their position to sixth. [41] Both Punjab and Kolkata needed to win every one of their remaining matches for any chance of qualification.
With ten matches remaining in the group stage, Chennai, Mumbai and Rajasthan were first to earn playoff stage berths while a few losses by Bangalore and Hyderabad gave Kolkata and Punjab a slim chance of competing for the final spot. [42] Kolkata was eliminated after suffering an upset at home by Pune. [43] Punjab, despite finishing their season with three straight wins, failed to catch up. [44] The tie between Bangalore and Hyderabad came down to the final match of the group stage, between Hyderabad and Kolkata. Hyderabad won to place themselves narrowly ahead of Bangalore by one win and qualify. [45]

Amidst the spot-fixing controversy and despite Faulkner's second five-wicket haul , Rajasthan finished the group stage with two consecutive losses and gave Mumbai and Chennai the advantageous top two positions. [44] In Qualifier 1 between Chennai and Mumbai, a 140-run partnership between Raina and Hussey against Mumbai's formidable bowling helped Chennai win by 48 runs and qualify for their fifth IPL Final. Dwayne Smith 's innings of 68 runs was the only highlight of Mumbai's innings. [46] Rajasthan faced Hyderabad in the Eliminator . On a slow pitch that troubled batsmen, Brad Hodge top-scored with an unbeaten innings of 54 runs to help Rajasthan win in a low-scoring match. [47]
In Qualifier 2 , Mumbai defeated Rajasthan by 4 wickets. Mumbai bowled better, as Harbhajan Singh 's 3 wickets earned him the man of the match . Smith was again the top-scorer for Mumbai, scoring 68 but better support from other batsmen allowed Mumbai to win with one ball remaining. [48] Mumbai faced Chennai in the Final , in which the Mumbai Indians had a shaky start but due to some great batting by Kieron Pollard (he scored 60*), they managed to reach a score of 148-9. They started well with the ball, reducing Chennai to 39-6, but captain MS Dhoni led from the front. However, he lacked support from the other end. Finally they finished at 125-9, giving the Mumbai Indians an unexpected victory and won their first IPL Title.

Cricket career[ edit ]
Boult accompanied the New Zealand A team on their winter training tour in 2007. [7] On 9 February 2007, he took two wickets for 28 runs and scored seven not out against India's Under-19 team. [8] He then travelled to Malaysia in February 2008 for the Under-19 World Cup.
On 21 January 2009, Boult was selected for the New Zealand squad for the one-day series against Australia at just 19 years of age. Boult only managed to play in the warm up game against the Prime Minister's XI and went wicketless of seven overs. During the tour Boult was clocked as the fastest bowler touring with the New Zealand team with a highest speed of 143.3 km/h (89.0 mph).
Boult made his Test debut in the 2011–12 season, in the Second Test against Australia in Hobart , a match won by New Zealand by 7 runs, New Zealand's first test win in Australia since 1985 and their first test win over Australia since 1993. He took four wickets in the match; additionally, he scored 21 runs in a tenth-wicket partnership with Chris Martin in the second innings.
His brother Jono Boult has also played cricket for Northern Districts.
In 2012, Boult produced a string of strong performances with the ball against the West Indies, India and Sri Lanka to consolidate his position as Tim Southee 's new ball partner. He carried this good form into 2013 when he took 19 wickets in 5 tests against England, including his best test match innings bowling figures of 6/68 at Eden Park in March.
After suffering a side strain during New Zealand's final test match against England at Leeds, Boult returned to the New Zealand test side for a two test tour of Bangladesh. Boult struggled in the hot and dry conditions, taking just 3 wickets and frenquently straying with his accuracy. However, when back in home conditions against the touring West Indies, Boult swiftly returned to his best. In the second test at the Basin Reserve Boult won man of the match after taking career best figures of 10 for 80 and completing a brilliant one-handed diving catch to his left to dismiss Dinesh Ramdin . In the first innings of the second test on the same venue against India, Boult made another one-handed diving right-handed catch to dismiss Ajinkya Rahane . He also had bowling figures of 4 for 146.
In 2014 T20 series against West Indies, Boult's squad number switched from 8 to 18, a number previously worn by Mathew Sinclair . [9]
In 2015, Boult received a Maiden call-up into the Indian Premier League by the Sunrisers Hyderabad and he was purchased for $600,000
Bowling and fielding style[ edit ]
Boult is a left-arm fast medium swing bowler. He makes up for his relative lack of height with deceptive pace and the ability to swing the ball both ways. Boult's primary weapon is the inswinger to the right-hander. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his childhood cricketing hero was Wasim Akram . In 2013, in a radio interview, former New Zealand Captain Jeremy Coney rated Boult as New Zealand's best bowling discovery since Shane Bond. He is also known to haul in one-handed catches with either hand, both in Basin Reserve . [10] [11] In 2014, he became the 4th test bowler since Richard Hadlee , Chris Martin and Ian O'Brien to claim 30+ wickets in consecutive years. He has also developed a great opening bowling partnership with Tim Southee , having taken 46% of all wickets between them since 2013, especially since the retirement of Martin. [12] In 2015 at Basin Reserve, he finally removed Kumar Sangakkara with his left hand after he scored a double century. [13]
In Trans-Tasman trophy 2015-16 series, against Australia, in the third Test, which was the first ever day-night test in the history, Boult became the first New Zealander and second overall after Josh Hazlewood , to took five-wicket haul in a day-night test. However, Australia won the day-night match by 3 wickets.
Batting style[ edit ]
Boult is a useful right-handed tailender, having scored a half century against Bangladesh in a 2013 test. He tends to open his stance by stepping the left (front) foot off to the side for his back-foot cover drive, much akin to Shivnarine Chanderpaul . He is also known to have a Flamingo Back Defensive stroke (FBD) where he lifts his left (front) foot up before the ball reaches the bat. [14]

Naman Ojha (Ind) and Kusal Perera (SL) made their Test debuts. This was 14th time that two wicketkeepers made their debuts in the same Test match. [20]
Ishant Sharma (Ind) took his 7th five-wicket haul in Test matches. His 5/54 are the best bowling figures by an Indian pace bowler in Sri Lanka . He also became the 8th Indian overall and fourth Indian pace bowler to reach 200 Teswly-appointed coach Duncan Fletcher , who said he was a supporter of the rotation policy. "While I was in England [Fletcher coached England between 1999 and 2007], I started the rotation policy resting senior guys," Fletcher said. "I was heavily criticised by the English authorities. It's important to do that considering the heavy schedule. We need to look into the matter as we go into the future."
He said he looked forward to working with the youngsters, but cautioned against complacency. " Any team playing at home is difficult to beat. We should not be complacent. There is a lot of talent in India and my job is to prepare these youngsters.
"Yes, we would like to beat England in England and Australia in Australia. But the first job is the tour of the West Indies. It's very important not to look too far down the road. India have a plan to stay at the top. The young players have the potential and this tour will show the depth of talent we have."
He also said that the club versus country debate is something that just has to be dealt with. "That's the way it is in modern day sports. We have to ensure that all the players are fit enough."
India's tour of the West Indies kicks off with a T20 game on Friday in Port of Spain.

Gameplay[ edit ]
In many other sports, the length of the game is dictated by a clock and teams swap offensive and defensive roles dynamically by taking possession of a ball or similar item. In cricket, however, one team, said to be "batting", attempts to score runs while the other team, said to be "fielding", attempts to prevent the scoring of runs and get members of the batting team out. The teams switch places after the fielding team has succeeded in getting a fixed number of players out, making a clock unnecessary.
A team's innings usually lasts until 10 of the 11 batsmen in the team are out, leaving the not out batsman without a partner and thus unable to continue, or until another event intervenes (such as the captain of the team declaring the innings closed for tactical reasons; or the time allotted for the entire game expiring).
In First-class cricket and Test cricket , each side has two innings. In one-day cricket and other abbreviated forms of the game , an innings lasts only for a set period or for a certain number of overs (typically 50 in one-day cricket and 20 in Twenty20 cricket).
An individual innings usually lasts until the batsman is given out, or until the end of the team innings. Although batsmen bat together in pairs, this combination is never called an innings: it is a partnership or a stand.
Origin[ edit ]
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the term innings has been used in reference to cricket since at least 1735. As cricket was a mature, highly organized sport in the 17th century in England, the term's origin could well precede this first recorded usage. The word inning meaning 'a gathering in' is first recorded in 1522, and could be related.
Usage outside cricket[ edit ]
The term innings is also used to refer to the play of one particular player (Smith had a poor innings, scoring only 12). By extension, this term can be used in British English for almost any activity which takes a period of time (The Liberal government had a good innings, but finally lost office in 1972, or You've had a fair innings, now it's my turn, meaning "you have spoken for long enough, now let me speak"). It is also used in reference to someone who has died at a reasonably old age or lived a rich and rewarding life (Ah, well. John was 89. At least he had a good innings). The baseball-derived parallel to this in American English is the term at bat .
Baseball and softball use the term " inning " to refer to a similar concept.



Main article: Indian national cricket captains
A total of 32 players have captained the Indian Test team so far and among them, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has the highest win rate (45,76%), followed by Sourav Ganguly (42.85%). Mahendra Singh Dhoni captained the team for most number of test matches (60). Sunil Gavaskar(1975 - 1984) has maximum number of drawn matches (30). As of 2012, Nawab of Pataudi remains the youngest captain for India in test matches. [6]

Part of the wicket[ edit ]
A wicket consists of three stumps that are inserted into the ground, and topped with two bails .
The stumps are three vertical posts which support two bails . [1] The stumps and bails are usually made of wood, and together form a wicket at each end of the pitch .
The overall width of each wicket is 9 inches (22.9 cm). Each stump is 28 inches (71.1 cm) tall with maximum and minimum diameters of 11⁄
2
inches (3.81 cm) and 13⁄
8
inches (3.49 cm). They have a spike at one end for inserting into the ground, and the other end has a U-shaped 'through groove' to provide a resting place for the bails. [2] In junior cricket the items have lesser dimensions.
Each stump is referred to by a specific name:
Off stump [3] is the stump on the off side of the wicket (the same side as the batsman's bat).
Middle (Lie) stump [4] is the centre stump, the middle of the three stumps.
Leg stump [5] is the stump on the on side of the wicket (the same side as the batsman's legs).
These names are relative to the batsman, so a right-handed batsman's leg stump becomes the off stump when a left-handed player is batting.
In modern professional play, the stumps are often emblazoned with a sponsor's logo. Although they are too far away from spectators to be seen, such logos are visible on television coverage.
For professional matches, often one or more of the stumps is hollow and contains a small television camera. This is aligned vertically, but can view through a small window on the side of the stump via a mirror. The so-called stump-cam gives a unique view of play for action replays, particularly when a batsman is bowled.
Manner of dismissing a batsman[ edit ]
In cricket , a batsman can be out stumped if:
the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket, while the batsman is:
out of his ground (because he has moved down the pitch beyond the popping crease , usually in an attempt to hit the ball); and
not attempting a run.
Being "out of his ground" is defined as not having any part of the batsman's body or his bat touching the ground behind the crease - i.e., if his bat is slightly elevated from the floor despite being behind the crease, or if his foot is on the crease line itself but not completely across it and touching the ground behind it, then he would be considered out (if stumped). One of the fielding team (such as the wicket-keeper himself) must appeal for the wicket by asking the umpire. The appeal is normally directed to the square-leg umpire, who would be in the best position to adjudicate on the appeal.
Stumping is the fifth most common form of dismissal after caught , bowled , leg before wicket and run out , though it is seen more commonly in Twenty20 cricket because of its more-aggressive batting. It is governed by Law 39 of the Laws of cricket . It is usually seen with a medium or slow bowler (in particular, a spin bowler ), as with fast bowlers a wicket-keeper takes the ball too far back from the wicket to attempt a stumping. It requires co-operation between a bowler and wicket-keeper: the bowler must draw the batsman out of his ground (such as by delivering a ball with a shorter length to make the batsman step forward to hit it on the bounce), and the wicket-keeper must catch and break the wicket before the batsman realises he has missed the ball and makes his ground, i.e. places the bat or part of his body on the ground back behind the popping crease . If the bails are removed before the wicket-keeper has the ball, the batsman can still be stumped if the wicket-keeper removes one of the stumps from the ground, while holding the ball in his hand. The bowler is credited for the batsman's wicket, and the wicket-keeper is credited for the dismissal. A batsman may be out stumped off a wide delivery but cannot be stumped off a no ball as bowler gets the wicket while stumping.
Notes:
The popping crease is defined as the back edge of the crease marking (i.e. the edge closer to the wicket. Therefore,  from the content category Tools ).

Creating category pages
See also: Wikipedia:HotCat
After you have determined an appropriate category name and know its parent category, you are ready to create the new category. To create a category, first add an article to that category. Do this by editing the article page. At the bottom, but before the interwiki links (if any are present), add the name of the new category, (e.g.: 
[[Category:New category name]]
 ), and save your edit. The as-yet-undefined category name will now appear as a red link in the article's category list at the bottom of the page.
Next, to create the category, click on that red link, which brings you back into the editor. Adding this new category into the appropriate parent category is much the same as with an article: at the bottom, simply add the parent category (e.g.: 
[[Category:Parent category name]]
 ).
Sometimes, a common-sense guess based on the title of the category isn't enough to figure out whether a page should be listed in the category. So, rather than leave the text of a category page empty (containing only parent category declarations), it is helpful – to both readers and editors – to include a description of the category, indicating what pages it should contain, how they should be subcategorized, and so on.
In such cases, the desired contents of the category should be described on the category page, similar to how the list selection criteria are described in a stand-alone list. The category description should make direct statements about the criteria by which pages should be selected for inclusion in (or exclusion from) the category. This description, not the category's name, defines the proper content of the category. Do not leave future editors to guess about what or who should be included from the title of the category. Even if the selection criteria might seem obvious to you, an explicit standard is helpful to others, especially if they are less familiar with the subject.
The description can also contain links to other Wikipedia pages, in particular to other related categories which do not appear directly as subcategories or parent categories, and to relevant categories at sister projects , such as Commons . Another technique that can be used is described at Wikipedia:Classification . Like disambiguation pages, category pages should not contain either citations to reliable sources or external links .
Various templates have been developed to make it easier to produce category descriptions; see Category namespace templates . There are hatnote templates including {{ Cat main }} and {{ Category see also }}; others are listed at Wikipedia:Hatnote#Categories .
A maximum of 200 category entries are displayed per screen. To make navigating large categories easier, a table of contents can be used on the category page. The following templates are some of the ways of doing this:
{{ Category TOC }} – adds a complete table of contents (Top, 0–9, A–Z)
{{ Large category TOC 2 }} – adds a complete table of contents with five subdivisions for each letter (Aa Ae Aj Ao At)
{{ Large category TOC }} – adds a complete table of contents with twenty-six subdivisions for each letter (Aa ... Az)
Subcategories are split alphabetically along with the articles, which means that the initial screen of a split category may not include all its subcategories. To make all subcategories display on each screen, add a category tree to the text of the category page, as described at the help page under Displaying category trees and page counts .
Interlanguage links work on category pages just as they do for articles, and can be used to link to corresponding categories on other language Wikipedias.

India in Bangladesh, 2007 May 18, 2007
Ishant Sharma to replace injured Munaf
Ishant Sharma will definitely join the Indian Test squad this time
© Martin Williamson
Ishant Sharma, the young Delhi fast bowler, will replace the injured Munaf Patel in the Indian Test squad in Bangladesh. Munaf, who missed the first Test in Chittagong with pain in his lower back, will fly back to India, and it is expected that Ishant will leave Delhi for Chittagong on Saturday.
On Friday morning Ravi Shastri, the cricket manager of the Indian team for this tour, spoke to a senior Indian board official to convey the news of Munaf's unavailability. Following this Dilip Vengsarkar, the chairman of the national selection committee, spoke to his colleagues over the telephone and it was decided that Munaf would return to India immediately and be replaced by Ishant. It is understood that the team management specifically requested the selection committee to send Ishant to Bangladesh.
Sharma, who has enjoyed a good first-class season for Delhi, was first in the news when it was suggested that he would be sent to South Africa a batsman whose bat or foot is on the crease marking, but does not touch the ground behind the crease marking, can be stumped. This is quite common if the batsman's back foot is raised so that only his toe is on the ground.
The wicket must be properly put down in accordance with Law 28 of the Laws of cricket : using either the ball itself or a hand or arm that is in possession of the ball. Note that since the ball itself can legally put down the wicket, a stumping is still valid even if the ball merely rebounds from the 'keeper and breaks the wicket, even though never controlled by him.
The wicket-keeper must allow the ball to pass the stumps before taking it, unless it has touched either bat or batsman first. If the wicket-keeper fails to do this, the delivery is a "no ball", and the batsman cannot be stumped (nor run out, unless he attempts to run to the other wicket).
End of the day's play[ edit ]
Stumps is also used as a term to mean the end of a day's play, e.g. "The umpires called stumps" means that the umpires have declared play over for the day. At the end of a session, i.e. before lunch or tea, the umpires will remove the bails ; at the end of the day's play, the umpires will also remove the stumps.

Early days[ edit ]
He was born into a Sikh family, educated at Brampton Manor School , East Ham and Barking Abbey School , Bopara attended Frenford Clubs and represented Essex Boys and Girls Clubs in their representative U14 cricket team. Bopara made his first-class debut for Essex in May 2002. In 2003 and 2004, he played several matches for England U-10s , including in the 2004 U-19 Cricket World Cup .
Bopara playing against Cambridge UCCE , April 2005
In the 2005 season , he scored 880 first-class runs, including his first first-class century. He also hit 135 in a non-first-class match against the touring Australians , putting on 270 for the second wicket with Alastair Cook , [1] and in 2006 he was selected for England A in their March tour of the West Indies , as well as their matches against the touring Sri Lankans and Pakistanis in the summer of that year. In July, he was selected in England's 30-man provisional squad for the 2006 Champions Trophy . He was select for the third edition of World T20 in Caribbean.
International career[ edit ]
2007 World Cup[ edit ]
In January 2007 Kevin Pietersen sustained a rib injury in England's first One Day International against Australia, keeping him out of the remainder of the series. Bopara was called up as his replacement, and made his ODI debut on 2 February. Later that month, he was named in the England squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup , [2] and he played his second ODI in England's second match of that tournament. In England's match against Sri Lanka , Bopara was named man of the match for his 52 off 53 balls, which brought England to within three runs of victory from a seemingly hopeless position. [3] [4] The partnership for the seventh wicket was an English World Cup record and was the second record partnership made by Bopara in the tournament, following his record fifth wicket partnership with Paul Collingwood against Canada . [5]
2007 India and Sri Lanka[ edit ]
In the first three games of the limited overs series against India Bopara was ineffectual, not batting in the first game and then making just 27 runs in the next two games combined. On 30 August, in the fourth match of huge series, he featured in a prominent tail end partnership, this time with Stuart Broad as the pair added an unbeaten 99 for the 8th wicket to defeat India at Old Trafford. Bopara finished 43 not out. He could not continue his good form, making just 11 in the next match.
He made his Test debut in the tour to Sri Lanka in December 2007 but had a poor series, scoring only 42 runs in five innings including three ducks , and taking only one wicket at an average of 81. One BBC commentator described him as "well out of his depth at Test level", [6] and Bopara was subsequently selected in the ODI squad but not the Test squad for the tour to New Zealand in early 2008. [7] However, he returned to the Test squad for the fourth Test against South Africa in August 2008, following a good season for Essex in the County Championship . [8]
On 4 June 2008, Bopara recorded his highest List A score in the quarter finals of the Friends Provident Trophy. He scored an unbeaten 201 runs off 138 balls, including 18 fours and 10 sixes. [9] Bopara's score was just the eighth instance of a double hundred in the history of List A cricket and the highest for six years. [10] On 9 September 2008 Bopara was named in England's 15-man squad for the inaugural Stanford Super Series in Antigua . There, England took on the Middlesex Crusaders and Trinidad and Tobago before facing the Stanford All-Stars on 1 November. The winning players in that match would have earned $1million each, with a further $1million being shared between the four players left out of the side. [11] This never came to fruition, however, as England fell to a heavy defeat in the final. The same day, Bopara was also handed an Increment Contract by the ECB. [12]
2008 New Zealand, South Africa and India[ edit ]
Bopara made just three in the first ODI in New Zealand. He made 23 in the next match, but did not bowl in either matches. In the return series in England, Bopara got off to a slow start, making scores of 10 and 27 in his first two matches. However, in the fourth match of the series he made 58 although it wasn't enough to prevent a narrow defeat for England. He made 30 in the final match of the series, leaving him with over 100 runs in the matches he played in.
He played in the first ODI against South Africa but was not required to bat, instead just bowling two overs and conceding 11 runs. England won the match by 20 runs.
He made 54 not out in the first ODI against India as he continued to consolidate himself in the ODI side. In the third match he made 60, although England lost the game by 16 runs. In the final match of the series he took figures of 1-42 as well as contributing 24 runs with the bat, although England again lost, this time by six wickets.
2009 T20 World Cup, West Indies and Australia[ edit ]
On 18 February 2009, Bopara, along with Amjad Khan , was invited to join the England Test squad on their tour of the West Indies as cover for Andrew Flintoff who was struggling with a hip injury. He scored 124 not out in a warm up match, earning him a place in the 4th Test against the West Indies. In the first innings he scored his maiden Test century with 104 off 143 balls before being caught. [13] He was dropped for the next Test of the series, however he was re-selected for the first Test of the home series against the West Indies on 6 May. [14] There he scored his second consecutive Test century, scoring 143 runs from 186 balls. [15] He then scored another century in the second Test, becoming only the fifth England player to score three consecutive centuries. [16] [17] He credited his success to his coaching by Graham Gooch at Essex. [18]
Bopara played well in England's opening game of the T20 World Cup, hitting 46 against the Netherlands. He made 37 against India before 55 against the West Indies, although England lost the match by 5 wickets. This meant that England progress no further in the competition despite being on home soil.
Australians Mitchell Johnson and Ricky Ponting stated to local media that during the upcoming 2009 Ashes series they were going to target Bopara in particular. [19]

On 22 June, the England selectors announced a sixteen-man preliminary Ashes squad for that summer's series; it included Bopara. [20] Cricinfo staff wrote that "Bopara's stock could not be higher". [21] He found success in a warm-up match against Warwickshire, however, scoring 104 while opening with Andrew Strauss . [22]
Bopara struggled during the series, however, with scores of 35, one, 18, 27, 23, one and a duck . [23] He was dismissed by Ben Hilfenhaus in five of his seven innings. Speculation grew about his position for the final Test, where England required a win to regain the Ashes, and it was announced on 16 August that Bopara had been dropped in favour of uncapped Jonathan Trott , who went on to score a century on debut. [24] Bopara returned to Essex and scored 201 against Surrey, [25] and despite being replaced in the Test team remained in England's squads for the ODI series against Australia and the Champions Trophy in September. [26] On 11 September 2009 it was announced that Bopara had been awarded an "incremental contract" with England, as had Trott. [27] However, after the Champions Trophy Bopara did not play ODI cricket for ten months. [28]
2010 Bangladesh and Pakistan[ edit ]
Trott kept his Test place after his impressive debut, and Bopara saw Michael Carberry and Eoin Morgan make their Tests debuts in the away and home series against Bangladesh respectively, with Bopara making neither squad. However, some impressive form for Essex in domestic 40-over and Twenty20 cricket in 2010, as well as a century for the England Lions saw him recalled to the ODI team for the series decider against Bangladesh, after an injury to Ian Bell . [28] Bopara hit a late innings of 45 not out from just 16 balls and took career-best ODI bowling figures of 4/38. [29] His convincing performance lead to him being selected in the two match T20 series against Pakistan. England won both matches, but Bopara had little impact, making scores of 11 and 12. Despite this, Bopara played in the ODI series, making 35 runs in the first game as England won by 24 runs. England won the next game, although Bopara only made 16 runs. His poor form continues as England suffered defeat in the final game and Bopara scored just 7 runs.

2011 World Cup and India[ edit ]
Bopara headed for the West Indies with England Lions in January 2011 after he missed out for the 2010-11 Ashes series Test and ODI squad and the 2011 World Cup . His stay in the Caribbean was cut short when he was called up to England's World Cup squad before the tournament as a replacement for the injured Eoin Morgan . Bopara played in England's opening match against the Netherlands and scored a match-winning 30 from 20 balls. After that, he did not play against India and Ireland as England chose to field a second spinner, Michael Yardy . Bopara returned to play against South Africa in place of the dropped Paul Collingwood . Bopara came in with the score at 15/3 and managed a partnership of 99 with Trott; Bopara ended with 60 of 98 balls. England restricted South Africa to 165 and Bopara was named the man of the match . England lost he next match by two wickets against Bangladesh, with Bopara scoring 16 runs. Bopara did not perform well against he West Indies, making just 4 with the bat, although England went on to win by 18 runs and progress to the quarter finals. Here, England were thrashed by ten wickets as Sri Lanka's openers made light work of England's target. Bopara scored 31 when he batted in the first innings.
In 2011, Bopara turned down £100,000 to play for the Delhi Daredevils in the IPL as a late replacement for the injured Paul Collingwood. [30] After Collingwood retired from Tests, Bopara and Morgan were the leading contenders to take his place in the side. [31] Bopara, who had already scored two centuries in the County Championship by May, was the favourite but an innings of 193 by Morgan for the England Lions against the touring Sri Lankans kept Bopara out of the Test side. [32] After missing out on the series against Sri Lanka, he returned to the team in August for the third Test against India in place of the injured Trott. [33] However, he could only manage 7 runs despite big scores from England's other batsmen. He kept his place for the next match, this time performing better with an unbeaten 44 as England went on to win the series 4-0 and become the best Test Team in the World.
In the following ODI series with India, Bopara was England's top run scorer with 197. He made 24 in the his first game of the series and followed his up with 40 in the next match. In the tied fourth ODI Bopara hit a career-best 96 before being dismissed by Munaf Patel . [34] He finished the series making an unbeaten 37 as England went on to win the series. In the return ODI series in India, Bopara was less effective. He made 8 as England won the first match followed by 36 in the second, which turned out to be his highest score of the series. He made 24 in the third ODI, but only made 8 and 4 in the final matches as England lost the series 3-2. On 23 September 2011, Bopara claimed the best bowling figures by an Englishman in a T20 international with 4/10. [35]
2012 Pakistan and West Indies[ edit ]
In the ODI series against Pakistan, Bopara contributed with both bat and ball. After hitting 50 in the first match, he followed this up with 58 in the second match of the series, as England won by 20 runs. He was not required to bat in the final match of the series, as England won the match by 9 wickets.
Despite losing his place in the test side, Bopara continued to play in the One Day and Twenty20 sides. He batted at number 4 in the opening ODI against the West Indies, making just 8. in the second game, he guided England to victory with an unbeaten 19. This gave England a 2-0 lead in the best of three series. In the only T20 International between the two sides, Bopara made 59 and helped England win the game. Throughout the series Bopara had also been used as a bowler, with batsman struggling to score of his medium pacers. Bopara also gained a reputation as a partnership breaker.
2012 Australia and South Africa[ edit ]
He was a key player for England in the limited overs series against Australia. He made 82 in the second ODI which led to him receiving the man of the match award. In the fourth game of the series he made 33 to help England win by 8 wickets, before hitting an unbeaten half century in the final match of the series to help England to another convincing victory.
Following his impressive form in limited overs cricket, Bopara was selected to play for the Test team in the opening Test against South Africa. However, he was out for a duck in the first innings as England slumped to defeat. Bopara was replaced by James Taylor for the second Test. Bopara returned for the ODI Series, making 16 in the second ODI. Although he was dismissed for a duck in the third game, he took 1-31 of ten overs to help England level the series. However, he continued to struggle with the bat, making 16 runs in the next two matches. Bopara continues to be used to bowl overs, as he continued to be economical and pick up occasional wickets.
Bopara was left out of the T20 team that toured India in 2013. He also went on to play no part in the ODI series, with the likes of Samit Patel and Chris Woakes being preferred instead. This was largely due to Bopara's poor form with the bat. Bopara was again overlooked for the T20 series against New Zealand. Bopara again missed out on selection for the ODI team against New Zealand, with many suggesting that his international was now over.
2013 Champions Trophy and Australia[ edit ]
Bopara returned to the England team for the 2013 Champions Trophy, now batting in the number 6 position. He made an unbeaten 46 against Australia to help guide England to victory. In the second game he was again unbeaten, making 33 and also bowled six overs. However, in a close game Sri Lanka won meaning England had to win their last game to qualify. They did so after beating New Zealand, with Bopara taking 2-26 in a low scoring match. England convincingly beat South Africa in the semi final, with Bopara not being required to bat. In the final against India Bopara took figures of 3-20 and also made 30 during a big partnership with Eoin Morgan, Hoe landmark; the fixture was also the first time he took ten wickets in a match for India. [28] [29] The second and third Tests ended in draws and India won the series 1–0; [30] Sharma was the leading wicket-taker on either side with 22 dismissals at an average of 16.86. [31]
After the tour of West Indies, India suffer a run of eight consecutive defeats in away Tests. In July and August the team played four Tests in England . England inflicted a 4–0 whitewash on India, [32] and in the process replaced India as No. 1 ranked Test team. [33] Playing in all four matches, Sharma managed 11 wickets at an average pushing 60. [34] During the series Sharma suffered an anckle injury and missed the ODI leg, but was sufficiently reovered to face the West Indies in November when India hosted them for three Tests. [35] While India won 2–0, Sharma managed five wickets from three matches at a cost of in excess of 65 runs each. [36] Sharma played in all four Tests of India's tour of Australia in 2011–12 . India lost the series 4–0, while Sharma took five wickets at the cost of 451 runs. [37]
In March 2012, Sharma underwent surgery on his ankle which had been troubling him for over a year. The operation meant that he missed the 2012 IPL. [38]
In 2013 Ind vs Aus ODI series, he gave away 30 runs in an over, equalling the most expensive over by an Indian bowler. (Yuvraj Singh had conceded 30 runs against England in an ODI match in 2007) [39]
After some bad performances against Australia in 2013 ODI series, he came back strongly against South Africa taking 4/40 in the third ODI on 11 December 2013 at SuperSport Park , which was his 2nd best performance in ODIs. [40]
In the 2014 tour of England , Sharma secured his career best figures of 7/74 at the Lord's , with an aggressive spell in England's second innings, bowling India to a 95-run win. [41] During the first test of the series, Sharma suffered the slight ignominy of becoming Alastair Cook 's sole Test wicket when caught down the leg side. [42] India finished the series losing 3–1. He finished the 2015 three-match Test series in Sri Lanka with 13 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul in the third Test at SSC . At the end of the match, he was handed a one match ban by the International Cricket Council (ICC), following an altercation with Dhammika Prasad in the course of the match. [43] The series also saw him pick his 200th wicket in Tests. [44] India won the series 2–1.
Bowling style
A right arm fast-medium bowler, the speed of Sharma's bowling has diminished since he emerged on the international scene, [45] although in 2008 he bowled a delivery at over 152 kilometres per hour (94 mph). [46] Such occurrences were not the norm as his pace dropped to around 130 km/h (81 mph), but under Eric Simons (who was India's bowling coach from 2010 to 2012) Sharma was regularly bowling in excess of 140 km/h (87 mph) when India toured Australia in 2011/12. [47] [48] According to India's former bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad he is amongst the most dedicated bowler in India's set up. [49]
Simons noted height was a factor in the length Sharma bowled, saying "For Ishant to hit the stumps, he has to pitch it fuller, and that means the batsman has more chance of keeping it out". [48] Former West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh identified two problems with Sharma's bowling action : his head drops when the ball is delivered and the position of his wrist varies. The first takes some of the speed out of the delivery, while the second reduces the chance of the ball seaming and swinging . The former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar suggested that the lack of movement in Sharma's bowling discouraged him from pitching the ball up so instead he tends to bowl short . The slower pace of his bowling when he pitches the ball up may explain why the yorker is not an effective delivery for him. Manjrekar went further, saying that "for all his talent and commitment he just does not take enough wickets"; when the remark was made in January 2012, Sharma had a bowling average of nearly 37 from 43 Tests. [50]

Michael Clarke , former captain of the Australia Test, ODI, and T20I cricket teams .
The captain sets where the fielders will stand, in consultation with the bowler and sometimes other senior players. The fielding positions will usually be dictated by the type of bowler , the batsman's batting style, and the captain's assessment of the state of the match (and hence whether to set an attacking or a defensive field). [2]
Powerplays[ edit ]
The laws governing the Powerplay period during a ODI match were amended on 7 July 2005. Along with the increased number of Powerplay overs from 15 to 20, to enable greater tactical flexibility, the decision of when to The initial fielding restrictions, termed Powerplay 1, apply during the first 10 overs of each innings. The second block of 10 Powerplay overs is divided between the Batting and Bowling Powerplays of 5 continuous overs each. The decision of when to take the batting/bowling powerplay rests the captains of the respective sides. [2] [4]
Bowling[ edit ]
The captain decides when each bowler will bowl. If a batsman is seeking to dominate the current bowler, the captain may ask someone else to bowl; alternatively, keeping the bowler on may be deemed the best chance of getting the batsman out or restricting the scoring rate. If the regular bowlers are not achieving the desired results, the captain may decide to use non-regular bowlers to attempt to unsettle the batsmen. The captain may also change the bowlers around to introduce variation, and to prevent the batsmen getting "set". [2]
In limited overs cricket the captain additionally has to make certain that bowlers bowl no more than their allotted maximum number of overs, and that experienced bowlers are available at the end of the batting side's innings, when the batsmen are usually looking to take risks to attack and score quickly. [2]
In the longer forms of cricket, when a new ball becomes available the captain decides whether to use it. [2]
See also: Batting order (cricket)
When the team bats, the captain decides the batting order . In professional cricket the captain usually changes the established batting order only for exceptional reasons, because batsmen tend to specialize in batting at certain positions. However, in certain circumstances it may be in the team's interest to change the batting order. If quick runs are needed, a naturally attacking batsman may be promoted up the order. A player who is 'in form' may be promoted to a higher batting position, at the expense of a player who is 'out of form'. [2]
If a wicket falls near the end of a day's play, especially if the light is failing, or if the bowlers seem particularly confident, the captain may choose to send in a non-specialist batsman, referred to as a nightwatchman . If the night watchman does not get out before the end of play then the specialist batsman will have been protected, and will not need to bat until the following day when conditions are likely to have improved. If the nightwatchman does get out, the cost of losing a late wicket will have been minimized, because the specialist batsman is still available to bat. [2]
Declarations[ edit ]
The captain may declare the team's innings closed at any time, but usually only does so as an attacking ploy, for instance if the captain thinks the team has enough runs to win the match, or if a sudden change in conditions has made it advantageous to bowl rather than bat. [2]
Follow-on[ edit ]
In a two-innings match, if the situation arises the captain decides whether to impose the follow-on . [2]
Miscellaneous[ edit ]
The captain is also consulted on whether an injured batsman from the opposing team may use a runner when batting. Permission is usually given if the batsman has become injured during the course of the match, but if the batsman was carrying the injury at the start of the match then the captain may refuse. (As from 2012 runners are not allowed in test cricket and injured batsmen are required to continue batting with the injury or retire hurt.) [5]
Other duties[ edit ]
As well as decisions taken either immediately before or during a match, captains also often have some responsibility for the good running of the cricket club. For instance, he or she may decide when the team is to practice, and for how long. In professional cricket the captain often has some say in who will form the squad from which teams are selected, and may also decide how young up-and-coming players are to be encouraged and improved, and how members of the squad who are not regularly selected for first-team matches are to gain match practice to be kept match-fit. [2]
David Warner , current vice-captain of Australia .
The captain may be assisted by a vice-captain. This is particularly useful when the captain is forced to leave the field of play during fielding, due to injury or illness (etc.). Some teams also allocate the vice-captain a more or less formal role in assisting with team selection, discipline, field-setting etc. There is no such rule that a vice captain will be appointed as the next captain. [6]
Vice captain may have a say in setting up the batting order along with the captain in consensus seeing the team's capability.
When a limited-overs match is affected by rain or bad light, and the Duckworth Lewis method is used to adjust the target for a team batting second, because of the complexity of the situation, the fielding side's captain may decide to give a piece of paper with the Duckworth Lewis calculations to the vice captain or another player, so that he is not overburdened with duties.



International recall as a batsman[ edit ]
Karthik batting in the nets.
In April 2006, Karthik's career was revived when he was recalled to the ODI team by selectors to give Dhoni a rest in the final ODI against England in Indore . He was not required to bat as India cruised to a seven-wicket victory. [2]
He was then reinstated as the reserve wicketkeeper for the tour to the West Indies . [22] after a campaign for India A during April in which he scored 134 runs at 33.50, including a man-of-the-match 75 runs against UAE on a tour to the gulf country. [23] [24] However, Karthik had little to do on his Caribbean sojourn, playing in only one non-first-class tour match ahead of the Tests. [2]
At the start of the 2006–07 season, Karthik scored 11 and 85 for India Red in the Challenger Trophy. He then played in two Duleep Trophy matches for South Zone, scoring 95 in the latter against Sri Lanka A. [2]
Karthik was given more opportunities at international level in late-2006 during the ODI tour of South Africa, after Yuvraj Singh was sidelined with a knee injury, and Karthik was given a spot purely as a batsman following the poor form of Suresh Raina and Mohammad Kaif . Karthik had opened the batting for Tamil Nadu in the previous season in the Ranji Trophy, as well as for South Zone in the Duleep Trophy. Playing in three of the ODIs, Karthik himself struggled, with 42 runs at an average of 14.00, and a top score of 17 as South Africa took a 5–0 whitewash. [14] With India's batsmen struggling, Raina and Kaif were dropped altogether from the Test squad, as Karthik was selected as a back-up wicket-keeper and middle order batsmen in the Test team for the first time in a year. [25] He then scored an unbeaten 31 to steer India to a six-wicket win in the Twenty20 International against South Africa with one ball to spare. [26] After Dhoni suffered from a finger injury, Karthik replaced him for the Third Test at Newlands against South Africa, playing in his first Test in over a year. With regular opener Virender Sehwag suffering from a loss of form, Karthik opened the innings with Wasim Jaffer , allowing Sehwag to bat in the middle order. He used his domestic experience to score 63 in the first innings, combining in a century opening stand, helping India to 414, enough for a first innings lead of 41. In the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 38, as the team suffered a batting collapse and were all out for 169, allowing the hosts to take the series 2–1 by five wickets. [20] In addition to his batting, his wicket-keeping was praised and brought former South African fast bowler Allan Donald to predict further success in the future. [27]
Karthik then featured in the four-match ODI series against West Indies, and after not batting in the victory in the first match, he top-scored with 63 as a specialist batsman when India recovered from 35/3 to post 189 on a slow wicket at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack . India went on to win by 20 runs, giving Karthik his first man of the match award. [28] He was rewarded with continued selection for the subsequent series against Sri Lanka and the 2007 Cricket World Cup . [14] [29] However, Karthik faltered in the series against Sri Lanka, managing only 31, 4 not out and 1, [2] leaving his position in jeopardy. In two warm-up matches in the West Indies before the start of the World Cup, Karthik scored 3 and 38 not out against The Netherlands and the West Indies . [2]
Karthik did not play a match at the World Cup, [14] and following India's unexpected exit from the first round, a group of players was dropped from the squad, including Sehwag. [30] [31] As a result, Karthik was selected as a specialist opener for the tour of Bangladesh, scoring 56 and 22 in the drawn First Test in Chittagong before scoring his maiden Test century in the Second Test in Dhaka, compiling 129 runs and featuring in a century opening stand as India took an innings victory. [20] He completed his tour with 58* and six in the ODI series, playing in the middle order as India won both matches. [14]
Prior to their tour of England, India played a series of ODIs in Ireland, against the hosts and South Africa. Karthik played in four matches, scoring 15 runs at 51.00 and keeping wicket in two of the matches. [14]
Karthik established himself as a regular opener in the mid-2007 Test series in England. After scoring 76 and 51 in the two tour matches ahead of the Tests, he recorded a half century in each of the three Tests, regularly helping India to make solid starts. In the First Test at Lord’s, Karthik made 60 in the second innings before India fell to 9/282 in pursuit of 380 when rain ended the match early. In the Second Test at Trent Bridge , Karthik scored 77, helping to lay a top-order platform for India’s first innings of 481, which gave them a 283-run lead. He then scored 22 as they reached their target of 73 to take a winning series lead. In the Third Test at The Oval , Karthik scored 91 as India batted first and helped to lay the foundation for their total of 664 and a first-innings lead. This was enough to secure a 319-run first innings lead, and although India were unable to finish England off, it was enough to secure a 1–0 series win. [2] [20] With a total of 263 runs at 43.83, he was the highest scorer in the series for India, [32] as the tourists won their first series in England for 21 years. [33] He started the ODI series with an unbeaten 44 in the first ODI as India capitulated to 184 all out and a 104-run defeat, but thereafter had four consecutive innings where he failed to score more than four runs, and he was dropped for the final two matches. [14]
Karthik was selected for the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa in September 2007, and played in India's earlier matches, scoring 11, 17, and a duck, [2] before being dropped from the semi-final and final in favour of Rohit Sharma . [34] India went on to win after starting the tournament as outsiders. Karthik kept his place in the Indian squad for the home ODI series against Australia but was on the outer after his decline in form in England, and played in only the final match in Mumbai , making a duck as India scraped home by two wickets. [2] [14]
After struggling in recent months in the limited overs format, Karthik bounced back during the Challenger Trophy at the start of the Indian domestic season. Playing for India Blue, he made a duck in the first match, but then made 65 against India Green and an unbeaten 116 in the final to guide his team through a succest wickets. [5]

The match also became the lowest stand for opening partnerships by both teams in a three-Test series.[ citation needed ]
Indian Ishant Sharma and three Sri Lankan Dinesh Chandimal , Dhammika Prasad , and Lahiru Thirimanne have been charged by the ICC for their roles in several angry exchanges during the match.
Injury to Murli Vijay meant that India had their third different opening combination of the series. However, the start was still poor and on back of an unbeaten century from Cheteshwar Pujara and a fifty from Amit Mishra India scored 312. The Sri Lankan innings had a similar poor start and was reduced to 47/6 before debutant Kusal Perera and veteran Rangana Herath took Sri Lanka to 201. India in their 2nd innings were reduced to 7/3 but successive 50+ run partnerships between Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and Stuart Binny meant India set a target of 384. Sri Lanka had another poor start until Mathews and Perea joined forces and took Sri Lanka from 109/5 to 248. Ashwin got the wicket of Perera after he was caught trying to reverse sweep which exposed the tail and led to India winning in the last session on the final day. Ishant Sharma , for his aggressive behavior was handed a one-match ban along with Dinesh Chandimal . [22] This victory marked India's 1st victory in Sri Lanka since 1993 and Kohli's 1st series victory as skipper. Ashwin was named man of the series.



He is known to work hard on the field but not get the wickets he seemingly deserves. Harsh but true: it's because he doesn't bowl enough wicket-taking balls

What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ishant Sharma ? I'm guessing it would be an image of a tall, young fast bowler coming off a long run-up ball after ball, giving his all for the team. It is this quality that impressed me on India's wretched tour of England, where Ishant ran in with great zest and bowled long spells the whole day, with intensity - all in a losing cause. When others around him were falling like ninepins, Ishant carried on gamely, day after day, showing the same passion for bowling in the last 20 minutes of the day as he did in the first 20.
Such bowlers, who are ready to do the hard yards for the team, are a boon to a captain. But there are bowlers of another kind that a captain would much prefer: bowlers who take wickets. This is where Ishant has proved a disappointment so far; for all his talent and commitment he just does not take enough wickets.
When I looked at Ishant's bowling record , it took me by surprise. Until recently I hadn't bothered to look at his numbers, for there was so much to like about Ishant on the field that it did not matter what was on paper.
Ishant has played 43 Tests at an average of 36.8. That's right, the bowler India keep looking at as a bright young prospect, expected to take over the leadership role from Zaheer Khan, has already played 43 Tests. Forty-three Tests makes you a seasoned Test player - a player for the present, not one for the future. It's time Indian cricket started looking at Ishant that way, expecting results from him today instead of tomorrow.
Let's now move to the other eye-catching number in his bowling record - the average. Bowling averages somehow never get as much media- and mind-space as batting averages do. When it comes to gauging the success of a player, it's simpler for fans to understand batting averages. To give you a very rough estimate of Ishant's bowling average in batting parlance: an average of 36 runs per wicket is about equal to averaging just under 35 per innings for a batsman. Would India be tolerant of a batsman who averaged around 35 after 43 Tests? Ishant's strike rate of 64.8 is also below par. This means he needs to bowl nearly 11 overs to get one wicket.
Granted, India are not spoilt for choice when it comes to seam bowlers, but that Ishant has generally been an automatic pick in the playing XI and his bowling returns are never a talking point suggests we have all been slightly swayed by his demeanour on the field. It is always "unlucky" Ishant, a bowler who deserves more wickets for his lion-hearted performance in the field. "Unlucky Ishant Sharma" has become his brandname in Indian cricket today.
But there is no such thing as an unlucky batsman or an unlucky bowler.  Over a short span, yes, but if someone is an "unlucky" bowler over a long period of time, he is simply not bowling enough wicket-taking balls. And that is the simple truth about Ishant - he has just not bowled enough potential wicket-taking balls, and it reflects in his record.
An average of 36 runs per wicket is equal to averaging just under 35 per innings for a batsman. Would India be tolerant of a batsman who averaged around 35 after 43 Tests?
Following a good series in the West Indies, where he picked up 22 wickets, his dry run resumed in England. After Ishant had another fruitless day in the field in the recent home series against West Indies, I asked Courtney Walsh, a fellow panelist on a TV show, for his take on Ishant. Walsh also bowled the same genre of seam as Ishant does, and he made an observation about what prevented Ishant from being a more potent wicket-taking bowler: the head falling away at the time of delivery, and the uncertain position of the wrist behind the ball when he lets it go were his two main deficiencies, Walsh said. Of course, this is not the first time these aspects of Ishant's bowling have been pointed out, but it is sad to see that these two critical issues have remained largely unaddressed.
All fast bowlers will tell you that the head falling away sideways at the time of delivery kills much of the speed, especially when the ball is pitched up. It's an important reason why Ishant is never quick when he pitches the ball up, and why the yorker is not a real weapon for him. This, along with his wrist action - where the two fingers on the seam tend to slide away rather than remain behind the seam when the ball is released - greatly diminishes the movement he would otherwise get in the air and off the pitch, and the zip.
When he tries to get the ball into that full-length area, it just does not respond. It reacts better when it's pitched shorter, which is why he feels compelled to bowl that length. But when the ball is short you don't find the edges, the leg-befores and the bowleds, as often. And that is what makes Ishant an "unlucky" bowler in Indian cricket.

==Indian Premier League==  ===IPL 2011=== In [[IPL 2011]], he played for [[Kochi Tuskers Kerala]]. He played only one match for them and that was against [[Rajasthan Royals]], where he didn't get the opportunity to bat. He bowled one over which went for 18 runs (0-6-0-0-6-6), [[Shane Watson]] hitting all three sixes on that occasion.  ===IPL 2013=== He was bought by [[Sunrisers Hydas cover for the injury-hit Indian squad late last year. The Indian team in South Africa then thought it would be a good idea for the 18-year-old Sharma to be a part of the Indian dressing-room and get a feel for cricket at the highest level. However, after some confusion in the board it was decided that Sharma would not be sent to South Africa after all.
This latest injury could be a serious blow to Munaf's career. It's worth remembering that Munaf came under a serious cloud of suspicion during India's tour of South Africa where he did not play a part in the majority of the tour and yet remained with the squad. Munaf made a comeback in the final Test, but was clearly well below full fitness, and did not perform to expectations. When India returned from that tour the Board of Control for Cricket in India did not take the Munaf issue lightly.
As soon as India returned from South Africa Niranjan Shah, the secretary of the BCCI, summoned John Gloster, the physio, to the Mumbai offices of the board for a full briefing on what exactly happened with Munaf. The board then raised concerns that Munaf had gone into the final Test carrying an injury and that this might have impacted India's chances. "According to his report Gloster said they had taken all the fitness tests necessary and felt that he was totally fit. I think Rahul [Dravid] and the other members of the team management must also have been convinced of Munaf's fitness before taking him in the eleven," Shah had told Cricinfo back then. "Certain injuries are such that the physio may believe that the player will recover any time. Whether the player has that same confidence or not is something else. The players should be honest with themselves, there's no point blaming the physio."
Most damningly, however, Shah laid the blame squarely at the feet of Munaf  in a strong statement. "Then we were surprised, when Dr Anant Joshi conducted tests, and Munaf complained about pain. Joshi then advised a couple of weeks' rest," he said. "Here I am a little concerned about the player himself. The player himself should be honest enough about his own fitness. The last 5% has to come from the player. The doctor cannot say how much pain you are experiencing. Many players can play even with a big injury but some players cannot play even with a small injury. The honesty of the player - at least in the case of Munaf Patel - is in question."
With Munaf once again breaking down just before the start of a Test series, serious questions are bound to arise over his long-term fitness.

Australia tour of India, 2nd Test: India v Australia at Mohali, Oct 17-21, 2008



1991-March 1996
Formative years
On first-class debut against Maharashtra , Dravid makes himself heard by scoring 82. He knocks on the Test doors with 153 in the semi-finals and a double-hundred in the Ranji Trophy final in 1996.
April 3, 1996
International appearance
Dravid makes his one-day debut against Sri Lanka in Singapore , making just 3 in an Indian win.
June 20-24, 1996
Distinguished Test debut
An injury to Sanjay Manjrekar gives Dravid his India cap at Lord's five years after his first-class debut. He and Sourav Ganguly then light up the arena with a 94-run partnership. Ganguly scores a memorable hundred, but Dravid misses out by five runs, walking on a thin edge. "I was a bit disappointed, sure, but not all that much. In the sense, I was happy I scored 95 runs, I looked at it as a cup half full, instead of half empty," Dravid says later.

January 16-20, 1997
Maiden hundred
India enter the bullring for the third Test against South Africa at the Wanderers after being walloped in the first two. Dravid, batting at No.3, settles down after a nervous start and cuts, pulls, and drives his way to a masterclass. His 148, with 21 fours, helps India post a healthy 410, and in the second innings he hits 81, with 11 fours, as India make a sporting declaration. Despite a valiant effort from Srinath, bad light allows South Africa, eight wickets down, to escape with a draw. But Dravid, adjudged the Man of the Match, restores India's pride.
May 21, 1997
Maiden ODI hundred in lost cause
In the famous Saeed Anwar match in Chennai , Dravid sustains India with his maiden hundred in ODIs but his dismissal triggers the end.
January 2-6, 1999
Double impact
Becomes the third Indian to score a century in each innings, against New Zealand in Hamilton . With another marathon effort - 490 minutes, 354 balls, and 31 fours - Dravid comes to India's rescue. From a shaky 17 for 2, Dravid, with Sachin Tendulkar, lifts India out of the hole. In the second essay, set an improbable 415, India stumble to 55 for 2 but Dravid stars again, with a 136-ball 103 and in the company of Ganguly helps India draw the game. Dravid becomes the third Indian after Vijay Hazare and Sunil Gavaskar to achieve the feat.

May 26, 1999
Into the record books
Against Sri Lanka in Taunton during the 1999 World Cup, Dravid scores 145 out of a stand of 318 in 45 overs with Ganguly, which is the highest in any ODI. Dravid establishes himself as the pacemaker, reaching his second successive hundred at almost a run a ball.
November 8, 1999
History again
Against New Zealand , Dravid makes his highest ODI score and helps break the record he and Ganguly made in the World Cup. Dravid, with a run-a-ball 153, partners Tendulkar and the pair adds 331 in 46 overs as India post their then-highest total of 376 for 2.
Summer 2000
County cricket comes calling
Dravid turns out for Kent, and guess who the club's coach is? John Wright of course. There is a meeting of minds, and the rest is history. "The arrival of Rahul Dravid to enhance our batting is a major boost. It is great news to have a batsman of Dravid's class in the team," Wright declares. Dravid tops the Kent averages with 1,039 runs at 49.48.

November 18-22, 2000
Double joy
After Andy Flower sweeps his way to 183 in Delhi , Dravid responds with 200, off 350 balls with 27 fours, and follows up with a breezy 91-ball 70 in the second innings, adding 110 runs for the third wicket with Ganguly, as India chase down the target of 190 in 37.3 overs with 9.3 overs and seven wickets to spare. Another century - 162 in the second Test and the fact that he was dismissed only once in the series, gives him an astounding series average of 432 .
March 11-15, 2001
The match
No Indian fan can ever forget Kolkata in 2001 . Dismissed by Shane Warne twice in three innings and demoted to No.6, Dravid has a point to prove. In the second innings, he joins VVS Laxman, with India still needing 42 runs to avoid an innings defeat, and lifts India from ignominy to incredible triumph. Warne is creamed for 41 runs in 51 balls.
June-September 2002
The great run-fest
Four centuries on a trot. Three against England  - 115 in the second Test , 148 in the third in a match India win, 217 - his first double hundred against England - in the fourth Test - and then follows them up with an unbeaten 100 against West Indies .
« Prev Showing 4 of 11 Next »
October 16-20, 2003
First taste of captaincy
Against New Zealand in Mohali , Dravid stands in for the indisposed Ganguly. In the drawn first Test, he compiles a mammoth 222 but, in the second, fails with the bat (1 and 5) and generally has a nightmarish Test as a captain. Despite centuries from Laxman and Sehwag, India are forced to follow-on after four top-order centuries see New Zealand run away to 630. However, India manage to draw the game.
December 2003-January 2004
Bring on the Aussies
The Dravid and Laxman show hits the road again in the second Test against Australia. After Australia amass 556, the duo come together just after tea on the second day and are not separated till the last over before tea on the third, by which time they add 303 for the fifth wicket , and power India to 523. After Ajit Agarkar comes up with his best performance to lay the foundation for a win, Dravid again stars in the second essay, remaining unbeaten on 72, taking India to a famous win. He also hiwever, once the pair were out the England innings fell apart and India went on to lift the trophy.
Following his good performance in the Champions Trophy, Bopara kept his place in the England squad for the ODI series against New Zealand. He played in the hard ODI, making 28 and bowling 6 overs for just 21 runs. England went on to win the match but lose the series. In the T20 series he made an unbeaten 30 in the first game, but was expensive with the ball. England went on to lose the match. Although Bopara was selected for the second ODI, the game was rained off.
Although Bopara never played in the Ashes series, he played in the two T20 Internationals. In the first match, which England lost, he scored 45 and participated in an impressive partnership with Joe Root. Bopara played in the second match which England won to tie the series. With many Test players rested for the ODI Series, Bopara was one of the most experienced players in the squad. He took 2-57 in the second ODI, and made 62 in the final match of the series. Throughout the series, Bopara was used to finish off the innings by accelerating towards the end. Bopara also bowled in long spells instead of the occasional spell, making him an important member of the team.
Bopara joined up with the England squad for the tour of Australia for the limited overs series, after the Test team had already lost 5-0. Things did not get much better in the ODI series, as they went on to lose 4-1. During the series, Bopara made 19 in the first match, before making a quick fire 26 in the second. He also took his first wicket of the tour in the second match. He then made 21 in the third match, before making 3 in the fourth, which turned out to be England's only win on the tour. He was stumped on the final match when on 25.He played in all three of the T20 games, scoring 65 from 27 balls in the first match although England lost by 13 runs. In the next two games he only managed 10 runs as England lost the series 3-0.
2014 West Indies, T20 World Cup and Sri Lanka[ edit ]
In the limited overs tour of the West Indies, Bopara made scores of 23, 38 not out and 5 not out. This gave him an impressive average of 66. Bopara bowled just 5 overs in the series, taking 1 wicket. In the T20 series, Bopara hit 42 in the first game, although England went on to lose. He made 14 in England's score of 152 in the second, although it ended in another defeat. He made an unbeaten 6 in the final game to help England avoid a whitewash, instead losing the series 2-1.
In the 2014 T20 World Cup, Bopara scored an unbeaten 24 against New Zealand, although England lost the match. He made 11 not out against Sri Lanka and helped finish the game of with Alex Hales to keep England's hopes of qualification alive. He made 31 in the defeat to South Africa, and took figures of 0-13 in his two overs. Bopara could only make 18 in the humiliating defeat against the Netherlands, although he bowled impressively, taking 0-15 in his four overs at an economy rate of less than 4 an over.In the entire tournament, Bopara bowled 6 overs for just 28 runs, and also scored 84 runs, making him one of England's stand out performers.
Bopara was poor in his first three matches against Sri Lanka. He managed just 10 runs and took just one wicket. He made 51 in the fourth match of the series but could not prevent an England defeat, before being dismissed for 17 in the final match as England again lost, and also lost the series 3-2.
Bopara was left out of the ODI squad against India, which drew criticisms from many pundits. He returned for the T20 between he two sides, making 21 runs as England secured a narrow victory.
Bopara returned to the England ODI squad for the tour against Sri Lanka. He made two fifties in the first two matches of the tour, hitting 65 in the first match and 51 in the second. Despite this, England lost both games. In the third ODI he only made six runs, although he did take his first wicket of the series. He made 22 in the fourth match and followed this up by making28 in the fifth ODI, a game England won to keep the series alive. In the sixth ODI of the series, Bopara could only make 13 as England lost the match which meant they could no longer win the series. Bopara was dropped for the final game of tour, but England lost this match to lose the series 5-2.
2015 Tri-series and World Cup[ edit ]
Bopara endured a poor Tri series against India and Australia. He scored 13 in the first game against Australia as England suffered a defeat, and was not required to bat as England comfortably beat India in the next game. He scored seven against Australia as England again lost, and made four as England beat India to reach the final. He made his biggest score of the series in the final, making 33 in a losing cause against Australia. Bopara also failed to take a wicket in the series.
Bopara did not play in the World Cup until he final game against Afghanistan, by which point England had already been eliminated from the competition. He picked up figures of 2-31 and was not needed to bat as England won by nine wickets.

In 2009, Ireland stated its intention to apply for Full Membership of the ICC with the aim of achieving Test status, [11] and restated its intention in 2012, but the 2012 plan aims to achieve Test status by 2020,. [12]
In 2014, the ICC announced the introduction of the ICC Test Challenge, which will see the holder of the Intercontinental Cup play a pair of two five-day match series against the lowest ranked test-playing nation every four years, starting in 2018. [13]
Conduct of the game[ edit ]
See also: Playing time (cricket)
The times of sessions and intervals may be altered in certain circumstances: if bad weather or a change of innings occurs close to a scheduled break, the break may be taken immediately; if there has been a loss of playing time, for example because of bad weather, the session times may be adjusted to make up the lost time; if the batting side is nine wickets down at the scheduled tea break, then the interval may be delayed until either 30 minutes has elapsed or the team is all out; [14] the final session may be extended by up to 30 minutes if 90 or more overs have not been bowled in that day's play (subject to any reduction for adverse weather); [15] the final session may be extended by 30 minutes (except on the 5th day) if the umpires believe the result can be decided within that time. [16]
In the early days of Test cricket, matches were played for four days. Until the 1980s, it was usual to include a 'rest day,' often a Sunday. There have also been ' Timeless Tests ', which did not end after a predetermined maximum time. In 2005, Australia played a six-day match against a World XI, which the ICC sanctioned as an official Test match even though the match reached a conclusion on the fourth day.
There have been attempts by the ICC, the sport's governing body, to introduce day-night Test Matches. [17] In 2012, The International Cricket Council passed playing conditions that allowed for the staging of day-night Test matches. [7] The first day-night Test is scheduled to take place on New Zealand's tour to Australia in November 2015. [8]
Further information: Cricket § Rules and game-play
Test cricket is played in innings (the word denotes both the singular and the plural). In each innings, one team bats and the other bowls (or fields ). Ordinarily four innings are played in a Test match, and each team bats twice and bowls twice. Before the start of play on the first day, the two team captains and the match referee toss a coin ; the captain who wins the toss decides whether his team will bat or bowl first.
In the following scenarios, the team that bats first is referred to as Team A and their opponents as Team B.
Usually the teams will alternate at the completion of each innings. Thus, Team A will bat (and Team B will bowl) until its innings ends, and then Team B will bat and Team A will bowl. When Team B's innings ends, Team A begin their second innings,sful run-chase against India Red. [2] He then rounded off his preparation for the next Test series with consecutive fifties for Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy. [2]
Karthik had a lean Test series against Pakistan at home in late-2008. In the first two Tests, he managed only 39 in two innings, passing single figures only once. [20] In the Third Test in Bangalore, Sachin Tendulkar was injured, and his replacement Yuvraj scored 170. Karthik, batting down the order with Gautam Gambhir taking his opening position, scored 24 and 52 in a high-scoring draw and kept wickets because of Dhoni's absence with injury. [20] [35] In the first innings, Karthik was behind the stumps as India set a world record for the most extras conceded in a Test innings. The 35 byes that were leaked were the second highest amount in Test history. [36] India won the First Test and the other matches were drawn. [2]
Karthik was retained for the Test tour of Australia as an opener, while Gambhir was ruled out after suffering an injury. However, he did not play in the first two Tests, [20] because Dravid was elevated into his opening position so that both Tendulkar and Yuvraj could bat in the middle order. When Dravid and Yuvraj both struggled in their new positions, [37] Dravid was moved back to his No. 3 position and Yuvraj dropped for the Third Test of the series, [38] but instead, it was Sehwag—who had earned a late call-up as the reserve opener after Gambhir succumbed to injury—and not Karthik who was recalled. [20] [39] During the Test leg of the tour, Karthik played in only one non-first-class match against an Australian Capital Territory Invitation XI, scoring 25 and 97. [2] Karthik was selected for the limited overs component of the Australian tour, [40] but did not play in any of the ten ODIs. [14] This meant that in almost three months on tour, Karthik only played in a two-day match and a Twenty20 match against Australia, in which he scored eight runs. [2]
Back on the fringes[ edit ]
Dinesh Karthik during the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series .
Upon his return to India, Karthik played in six one-dayers for Tamil Nadu and South Zone, reaching 40 twice in six innings. [2] Karthik played in the 2008 Indian Premier League as the wicket-keeper for the Delhi Daredevils , scoring 145 runs at 24.16 with a strike rate of 135.51. [41] His highest score was an unbeaten 56 to steer Delhi to a five-wicket win in a group match over the Mumbai Indians . [2] In a match against the Deccan Chargers , team-mate Amit Mishra took a hat-trick, and when the new batsman came in, he charged out of his ground and missed, only for Karthik to miss the opportunity for the stumping and double hat-trick.
He was recalled to the Test team as a wicket-keeper for the July 2008 tour of Sri Lanka after Dhoni chose to take a break from cricket, citing the need to rest. [20] [42] Karthik played in the first two Tests, but struggled with the bat in the middle-order, scoring 36 runs at 9.00, falling all four times to the spinners Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis . He also dropped frequent catches and he was replaced for the Third Test by Patel. [2]
Following the loss of his place in the Indian team, Karthik returned home and played for India A in a series of one-dayers against their counterparts from Australia and New Zealand, and then for India Blue in the Challenger Trophy. He had an unsuccessful campaign, accumulating only 70 runs at 11.66. [2]
He then had a strong domestic first-class season in 2008–09. After starting the Ranji Trophy campaign with two single-figure scores, he scored 213, featuring in a 213-run partnership with Subramaniam Badrinath as Tamil Nadu defeated Uttar Pradesh by an innings. Karthik then scored 123 and 113 in consecutive matches against Baroda and Railways before ending his Ranji Torphy campaign with 72 against Uttar Pradesh in the return match. He then continued his strong run against Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy , scoring 153 and 103 in one match. Karthik ended with 1026 runs at 64.12 for the season, including five centuries and two fifties.
He then scored an unbeaten 117 against Kerala in the one-day tournament and was selected for the tour of New Zealand as the reserve wicket-keeper. After watching the entire T20 and ODI series from the sidelines, he played in the Second Test after Dhoni was injured, but he was criticised for dropping multiple catches as the hosts amassed 9/619 and made only six in his only innings.
In the 2009 Indian Premier League held in South Africa, Karthik played in each of Delhi's 15 matches, scoring 288 runs at 36.00, passing 40 on three occasions and making 17 dismissals. Delhi topped the pool stage of the tournament, but Karthik made only nine in the semi-final as Delhi were defeated by six wickets by the Deccan Chargers . [2]
He got a chance again in India's four match tour of West Indies where he replaced opener Sehwag, who was out with a shoulder injury. [43] He scored 67, 4 and 47 as an opener which could help him claim a berth for the future, as India took the series 2–1. [44] [45] [46]
With Sehwag still injured, he was retained for a short triangular ODI tournament in Sri Lanka in September. He scored 4 and 16 in India's two round robin matches and was dropped for the final, in which India triumphed over the hosts. Karthik was retained for the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa, but after his performances in Sri Lanka, was omitted for the first two matches. He was given an opportunity in India's final pool match against the West Indies and scored 34 in a seven-wicket win, but it was not enough to prevent India's first round exit. [2]
Sehwag and Yuvraj recovered in time for the home ODI series against Australia, so Karthik returned to domestic duty at the start of the 2009–10 season. He played in Delhi's four matches in the 2009 Twenty20 Champions League , scoring 92 runs at 23.00, including a top-score of 61 against Sri Lanka's Wayamba . Delhi were knocked out in the Super 8 stage. Karthik played in six Ranji Trophy matches for Tamil Nadu as captain, and he had an uneven run of scoring with the bat. He scored 152 against Orissa and 117 against Punjab, and added a further two scores of at least 70, but managed only 16 runs in his four other innings. Karthik ended the season with 443 runs at 55.37. He also resorted to bowling himself twice, when matches were proceeding towards a draw, with no success; he delivered 14 overs and conceded 97 runs in all. However, Karthik was not to lead Tamil Nadu into the knockout stages of the competition. [2]
In December 2009, Karthik was recalled to the ODI team during the Sri Lankan tour of India after Dhoni was banned after the second match for two matches because of slow over rates. Karthik kept wickets in the next two matches, scoring 32 and 19 and remaining unbeaten in both instances, helping to guide India to the target in successful runchases. [2] He retained his place as a middle-order batsman in the fifth and final match when Dhoni returned after Tendulkar was rested and Yuvraj injured, but the match was ended prematurely due to an unsafe pitch.
Karthik retained his place for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh against the hosts and Sri Lanka after Tendulkar was rested for the tournament. Karthik played as an opener along Gambhir in the last two of the round-robin matches after Sehwag was rested. Karthik made 48 and 34 in quick time as India won both matches but was dropped for the final, which was lost. [2]
Karthik then played in the First Test at Chittagong after Dhoni was forced to withdraw due to injury. He made a duck in the first innings as India stumbled to 243 on the first day. He then made 27, falling in pursuit of quick runs for a declaration after India recovered in the second innings. India went on to win the match, [2] and Karthik watched the next match from the sidelines after Dhoni recovered and steered India to a clean sweep.
Karthik was then displaced as the reserve gloveman for the two-Test home series against South Africa; Wriddhiman Saha was called up to be Dhoni's deputy. Karthik scored 183 and 150 in the Duleep Trophy final against West Zone, becoming the third player after Lalchand Rajput and Yuvraj Singh to score centuries in both innings of a Duleep Trophy final. However, it was not enough as Yusuf Pathan scored an unbeaten 210 from only 190 balls to set a new world record for a successful run-chase. [47]
For 2012 Indian Premier League Dinesh Karthik transfer to Mumbai Indians from Delhi Daredevils . [48]
In the 2013 Indian Premier League Dinesh Karthik had some good starts for the Mumbai Indians, in the early matches: in particular, when he scored a quick 86 against the Delhi Daredevils in their home match at the Wankhede Stadium. The Mumbai Indians went onto win their first IPL trophy this season with Karthik batting and wicket-keeping in all 19 of their matches. In almost all the matches he batted third and was seen as a key run getter for the team. He ended the tournament with 510 runs and was within the top 10 run scorers of the tournament.
Karthik was recalled to the Indian ODI team for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy following a great domestic season and IPL performance. He scored back to back centuries in the two warm up games sealing his place in the team for the tournament. Unfortunately these centuries will not be counted in his first class statistics as the teams were playing a 15- side team. He scored an unbeaten 51 in India's group match against the West Indies.

1.  Our Services
The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge.  Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here . However, we act only as a hosting service, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework that allows our users to build the Wikimedia Projects by contributing and editing content themselves.  Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and the other users:
We do not take an editorial role: Because the Wikimedia Projects are collaboratively edited, all of the content that we host is provided by users like yourself, and we do not take an editorial role.  This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content.  Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content.  Instead, we simply provide access to the content that your fellow users have contributed and edited.
You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on Wikimedia Projects, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws.  For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America.  Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. WMF generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification.
2. Privacy Policy
We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy , so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information.

By using our services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country.
3. Content We Host
You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we provide a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable.  We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.
Our content is for general informational purposes only: Although we host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice.  Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project websites.

Paid contributions without disclosure
These Terms of Use prohibit engaging in deceptive activities, including misrepresentation of affiliation, impersonation, and fraud. As part of these obligations, you must disclose your employer, client, and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways:
a statement on your user page,
a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or
a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions.
Applicable law, or community and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure.
A Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section when contributing to that Project. An alternative paid contribution policy will only supersede these requirements if it is approved by the relevant Project community and listed in the alternative disclosure policy page .
For more information, please read our FAQ on disclosure of paid contributions .
We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the above terms.
5. Password Security
You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and should never disclose it to any third party.
6. Trademarks
Although you have considerable freedoms for re-use of the content on the Project websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators.  Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks.  All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy .
7. Licensing of Content
To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to re-distribute and re-use their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to re-use and re-distribute is granted to any derivative works.  In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who cares to access it.
You agree to the following licensing requirements:
Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under:
GNU Free Documentation License (“GFDL”) (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).
(Re-users may comply with either license or both.)
The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license.  In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under that particular license.  For example, at the publication of this version of the Terms of Use, English Wikinews mandates that all text content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic License (CC BY 2.5) and does not require a dual license with GFDL.
Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms.
Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses.  We consider it giving credit where credit is due – to authors like yourself.  When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions:
Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all authors and editors);
Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or
Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with the CC BY-SA 3.0 license (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature)("CC BY-SA"). Content available only under GFDL is not permissible.
You agree that, if you import text under a CC BY-SA license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion.  Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text.  The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.
Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted re-use and re-distribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy , and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing.   Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to that Project.
No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Wikimedia Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services.
Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome!  It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition.  When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.
Re-use: Re-use of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under "fair use" or similar exemptions under copyright law.  Any re-use must comply with the underlying license(s).
When you re-use or re-distribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions:
Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are re-using (since each page has a history page that lists all authors and editors);
Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or
Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).
If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in “Importing text,” above).  In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to re-license it under GFDL.  To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to re-use or re-distribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page.
In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements.  Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly.  Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear for example in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere.  Where there are such visible notations, re-users should preserve them.
For any non-text media, you agree to comply with whatever license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work).  When re-using any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.
Modifications or additions to material that you re-use: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 3.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature).
When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available.
With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified.  If you are re-using text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text.  For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.
8. DMCA Compliance
The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be re-used by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers.
However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith.  In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper.  For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Chilling Effects website.
If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed under the DMCA.  To make such a request, please email us at
legal
wikimedia.org
or snail mail our designated agent at this address .
Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than prescribed under the DMCA.  In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns.  For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, look here . Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at
info
.
9. Third-party Websites and Resources
You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources.  Although the Projects contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.
10. Management of Websites
The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions.  At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement.  In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior.  In such cases, we reserve the right, but do not have the obligation to:
Investigate your use of the service (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or appropriate governmental request;
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests;
Refuse, disable, or restrict access to the contribution of any user who violates these Terms of Use;
Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat copyright infringement;
Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and
Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public.
In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had his or her account or access blocked under this provision, he or she is prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission.  Without limiting the authority of the community, the Wikimedia Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies.
The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies.  You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition.
Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy .  In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures.
The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 12 of these Terms of Use.
11. Resolutions and Project Policies
The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time.  Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable.
12. Termination
Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time.  In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Term and this is followed by Team B's second innings. The winning team is the one that scores more runs in their two innings.
A team's innings ends in one of the following ways: [18]
The team is "all out". This typically occurs when a team has lost ten wickets (ten of the eleven batsmen having been dismissed ) and are "bowled out". It may occasionally occur with the loss of fewer wickets if one or more batsmen are unavailable to bat (through injury, for example).
The team's captain declares the innings closed, usually because they believe they have enough runs. A declaration before the innings starts is called an innings forfeiture.
The team batting fourth score the required number of runs to win.
The prescribed time for the match expires.
If, at the completion of its first innings, Team B's first innings total is 200 or more fewer than Team A's, the captain of Team A may (but is not required to) order Team B to have their second innings next. This is called enforcing the follow on . [19] In this case, the usual order of the third and fourth innings is reversed: Team A will bat in the fourth innings. It is rare for a team forced to follow on to win the match. In Test cricket it has only happened three times, although over 285 follow-ons have been enforced: Australia was the losing team on each occasion, twice to England, in 1894 and in 1981, and once to India in 2001. [20]
If the whole of the first day's play of a test match has been lost because of bad weather, then Team A may enforce the follow on if Team B's first innings total is 150 or more fewer than Team A's. During the 2nd test between England and New Zealand at Headingley, Leeds, 24–28 May 2013, England batted first after the first day was lost because of rain. [21] New Zealand, batting second, scored 180 runs fewer than England, meaning England could have enforced the follow on, though chose not to. This is similar to four-day first class cricket, where the follow on can be enforced if the difference is 150 runs or fewer.
After 80 overs, the captain of the bowling side may take a new ball , although this is not required. [22] The captain will usually take the new ball: being harder and smoother than an old ball, a new ball generally favours faster bowlers who can make it bounce more variably. The roughened, softer surface of an old ball can be more conducive to spin bowlers, or those using reverse swing . The captain may delay the decision to take the new ball if he wishes to continue with his spinners (because the pitch favours spin). After a new ball has been taken, should an innings last a further 80 overs, then the captain will have the option to take another new ball.
A Test match may end in one of six results :
All four innings are complete. The team batting fourth are all out before overtaking the other team, usually before matching the other team's score. The team that batted third are the winners by a margin equal to the difference in the aggregate runs scored by the two teams (for example, "Team A won by 95 runs"). Very rarely (in over 2,000 Test matches played, it has only happened twice ) the scores can end level, resulting in a tie .
The team batting in the fourth innings overtakes the opposing team's run total. The match ends, and the team batting fourth is the winner by a margin equal to the number of wickets still to fall in the innings (for example, "Team B won by five wickets").
The third innings concludes with the team that batted twice still trailing the team that batted once. The match ends without playing a fourth innings. The team that batted only once is the winner by a margin equal to "an innings" plus the difference in aggregate run totals of the teams (for example, "Team B won by an innings and 26 runs").
Time for the match expires without a result being reached. This usually occurs at the end of the last day of the match. The result is a draw : there is no winner, no matter how superior the position of one of the sides. Rain causing a loss of playing time is a common factor in drawn matches, although matches may be drawn even without interference from the weather: usually as a result of poor time management or an intentional effort on the part of one team to avoid losing.
The match is abandoned because the ground is declared unfit for play. This has occurred three times, resulting each time in a draw being declared: England v Australia at Headingley , Leeds , 1975 (vandalism); [23] West Indies v England at Sabina Park , Kingston, Jamaica , 1998 (dangerous ground); [24] West Indies v England at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium , Antigua , 2009 (dangerous ground). [25]
The match is awarded through a forfeiture. If a team refuses to take the field of play, the umpires may award the match to the opposing team. [26] This has only happened once in Test cricket, in the 2006 Fourth Test between England and Pakistan . [27] [28]
Competitions[ edit ]
Test cricket is almost always played as a series of matches between two countries, with all matches in the series taking place in the same country (the host). Often there is a perpetual trophy that is awarded to the winner, the most famous of which is the Ashes contested between England and Australia. There have been two exceptions to the bilateral nature of Test cricket: the 1912 Triangular Tournament , a three-way competition between England, Australia and South Africa (hosted by England), and the Asian Test Championship , an event held in 1998–99 and 2001–02.
The number of matches in Test series has varied from one to seven. [29]
Up until the early 1990s, [30] Test series between international teams were organised between the two national cricket organisations with umpires provided by the home team. With the entry of more countries into Test cricket, and a wish by the ICC to maintain public interest in Tests in the face of the popularity of one-day cricket , a rotation system was introduced that sees all ten Test teams playing each other over a six-year cycle, and an official ranking system (with a trophy held by the highest-ranked team). In this system, umpires are provided by the ICC. An elite panel of eleven umpires has been established, and the panel is supplemented by an additional International Panel that includes three umpires named by each Test-playing country. The elite umpires officiate almost all Test matches (usually not a Test involving their home country); the International Panel is only employed when the cricketing calendar is filled with activity, or for one-day internationals (ODIs).

Sides designated as "England" began to play in the late 18th century, but these teams were not truly representative. Early international cricket was disrupted by the French Revolution and the American Civil War . The earliest international cricket match was between USA and Canada , on 24 and 25 September 1844. [31] This has never been officially considered a "Test match". Tours of national English sides abroad took place, particularly to the USA, Australia and New Zealand. The Australian Aborigines team became the first organised overseas cricketers to tour England in 1868 .
Two rival English tours of Australia were proposed in the early months of 1877, with James Lillywhite campaigning for a professional tour and Fred Grace for an amateur one. Grace's tour fell through and it was Lillywhite's team that toured New Zealand and Australia in 1876–77. Two matches against a combined Australian XI were later classified as the first official Test matches. The first match was won by Australia, by 45 runs, and the second by England. After reciprocal tours established a pattern of international cricket, The Ashes was established as an ongoing competition during the Australian tour of England in 1882. Surprisingly beaten, a mock obituary of English cricket was published in the Sporting Times the following day: the phrase "The body shall be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia" prompted the subsequent creation of the Ashes urn. The series of 1884–85 was thts 90 plus scores in the remaining two Tests to top the Indian averages - 619 runs at a staggering 123.80.

Fun in Pindi
After two quiet Tests he explodes in the third Test with his highest score yet - a magnificent 270, paving the way for a series win against Pakistan.

Last man standing
A minefield awaits the two teams, with the series already in Australia's bag, in the last last Test . While the Indian top-order is whipped by a rampaging Jason Gillespie, Dravid, leading the side, holds one end up. Groping with the demons in the pitch, he is the only Indian batsman to bat more than 100 deliveries and is left stranded on 31. Sparkling half-centuries from Laxman and Tendulkar in the second innings set up the game for Harbhajan and Murali Kartik to spin India to a thrilling 13-run win.
December 17-21, 2004
First man in history
A 160 against Bangladesh in Chittagong, 2004 gives him a unique record - he is the first player to score centuries in all Test-playing countries. And until the ICC decides to give some new country Test status, Dravid's record can only be equalled, not broken.
March 16-20, 2005
Pakistan run into the wall, again
He lights up Eden Gardens again, with centuries in both innings (110 and 135) to charge India to a 195-run victory over Pakistan. A 122-run partnership with Tendulkar in the first innings and a stirring 165-run stand with Dinesh Karthik (93) in the second sets up an Indian win. In the second innings, Sehwag, Tendulkar and Ganguly fall early while Laxman retires hurt with a swollen left eyebrow, courtesy a snorter from Mohammad Sami, to leave India shaking at 156 for 4 before Dravid unleashes his special. He guides his young partner and they set up the game for Kumble, who sends Pakistan hurtling to a big defeat.

And... here comes the captain
After a dramatic period involving leaked emails and public spats, Dravid is appointed as the captain for the Test series against Sri Lanka. "It's time for us to look ahead," Kiran More, chairman of the selection panel, declared as the curtains came down on the captaincy saga of Ganguly.
January 13-17, 2006
First hundred as a captain
Hits a hundred in a run-fest in Lahore , and is involved in a mammoth 410-run first-wicket stand with Virender Sehwag. He follows up with another century in the next Test.

Dravid's one-man show delivers the Holy Grail
At Sabina Park , the colossal figure of Dravid - who passed 9000 Test runs along the way - sets the foundation for India's second series victory in the Caribbean, 35 long years after Ajit Wadekar and his men had seen off the challenge posed by Sir Garfield Sobers and friends. Without Dravid's two masterful efforts the result would probably have been reversed. If his 81 on the first day is executed with a shield - he dodges the dangerous deliveries and keeps out the straight ones - his second-innings 68 is played with a sword.

10,000 ODI runs
With a drive to long-on for a single, Dravid becomes only the sixth player to get to 10,000 runs in ODIs. Of the batsmen who have reached the milestone, Tendulkar does it in the least number of innings - only 259 - while Dravid's 287 innings puts him in fourth place.
March 17, 2007
Ousted by Bangladesh
One of the toughest defeats of his career, as India go down by five wickets against Bangladesh in the World Cup. Another defeat against Sri Lanka - despite Dravid's 60 - against Sri Lanka a week later means India are dumped out of the World Cup.
July-August, 2007
An Indian summer
Under Dravid, India tour England and win their first Test series in England since 1986, albeit 1-0. Just one fifty in six innings is average by any standards, more so if your standards are as high Dravid's. But as captain he is blessed with luck: winning the toss in two of the three Tests, one of which produces a decisive result.

Dravid resigns as captain
In a letter written to the Indian board, Dravid asks to be relieved of the captaincy before Australia's tour later in the month. Under his captaincy India win eight Tests, including series wins in the West Indies, Bangladesh and England. However, his ODI record is patchy: he begins on a winning streak, where India set a record for 16 consecutive successful chases. But then India exit the 2007 World Cup in the first round and lose the NatWest series to England 4-3.
October 27, 2007
Dropped from ODIs
Dravid is left out of the squad to face Pakistan in a five-match series. His ODI career appears over.
December 20, 2008
Happy to be contributing again
Dravid ends a wretched 2008 with his 26th Test century, a dogged, stonewalling effort against England in Mohali .

A call for help
In response to India's woes against short-pitched bowling in the summer of 2009, the selectors recall Dravid after nearly two years for a tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy. He is dropped less than a month later.
November 2009-February 2010
Centuries galore
Dravid scores three centuries in seven innings versus Sri Lanka and Bangladesh,  including two in consecutive Tests against Sri Lanka in November 2009.
July 2010-January 2011
Ordinary patch
Except for two centuries against a weak New Zealand attack, Dravid struggles for runs with only one half-century in 17 other innings. He ends the South Africa series with an average of just 20.

July-August 2011
Back at his best
Standing tall amid a 4-0 drubbing in England, Dravid scores three centuries in a series in which no other Indian manages even one. Two of those hundreds are as openers, and in the fourth Test at The Oval he becomes only the third Indian to carry his bat, scoring an unbeaten 146 out of 300.
December 2011-January 2012
Disappointment in Australia
In eight innings in Australia, Dravid manages only 194 runs at an average of 24.25. It's to be his last Test series.

The blonde bombshell arrives
The younger brother of Australia international Shane Lee makes his Sheffield Shield debut for New South Wales against Western Australia at the SCG. Takes three wickets and the opposition rate him the fastest bowler they've faced in Australia.
1999-2000
A tearaway beginning
Lee overcomes stress fractures in the back to emerge a contender for national selection. He is named the twelfth man for the Perth Test against Pakistan but makes his debut against India at the MCG. Rattles a clueless India with his tearaway pace by taking a five-wicket haul in the first innings, including a wicket in his first over. Ends the series with 13 wickets in two Tests. Takes his maiden one-day five-wicket haul against the Indians in Adelaide on Australia Day. Storms New Zealand with 18 wickets in three Tests in his first away series.
December 2000-August 2001
Injury calling
His first major injury setback. After taking seven wickets against West Indies at the WACA, he suffers a stress fracture to the lower back and misses the rest of the series. Returns for the one-day tri-series but injures his elbow and hence, misses the historic tour of India. Returns for the Ashes tour.

One-day wonder
Finishes the leading wicket-taker in the 2002-03 VB Series with 18 wickets, including a match-winning 5 for 30 in a tense second-final against England. Lee has an outstanding World Cup in South Africa and finishes second in the overall wicket charts with 22 scalps at 17.90. Carries his form to the West Indies where he finishes with 17 wickets.
2003-04
The designated drinks man
In the absence of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, Lee has to carry the bowling attack but finds the going tough against India. Returning from an abdominal injury, he takes eight wickets in two Tests but at an expensive 59.50 per wicket. Suffers an ankle injury and misses the tour of Sri Lanka. He's out for nearly five months and misses yet another Test tour of India. The return of Michael Kasprowicz puts enormous pre first to be held over five matches: Shaw, writing in 1901, considered the side to be "the best ever to have left England".
The first Test series not to involve Australia occurred in 1888–89, as an understrength England side toured South Africa.

His family presently reside at Sadiq Nagar, New Delhi. [1]



Early years[ edit ]
Ceylon, as the country was known before 1972, played its first first-class match under that name against Marylebone Cricket Club at Nomads Ground, Victoria Park, Colombo in 1926–27, losing by an innings . [4] The team's first win came against Patiala at Dhruve Pandove Stadium in 1932–33. [5]
The Ceylonese side competed against Madras in the M. J. Gopalan Trophy games from the 1950s, through the change of name to Sri Lanka, well into the 1970s. Sri Lankan cricket team's One Day International debut came in the 1975 Cricket World Cup and their first One Day International win against a Test cricket playing nation came in the 1979 Cricket World Cup against India . Sri Lanka were later awarded Test cricket status in 1981, by the International Cricket Council .
Rise to Prominence[ edit ]
1996 Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
1996 Cricket World Cup , hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan team was led by Arjuna Ranatunga , where they played their first round in Group A with Australia, West Indies, India, Zimbabwe and Kenya. Australia and The West Indies forfeited the matches against Sri Lanka held in Sri Lankan soil due to safety concerns, so Sri Lanka won both matches by a walkover. Sri Lanka won against Zimbabwe by 6 wickets, courtesy of Aravinda de Silva 's 91 runs. Sanath Jayasuriya overtook Indian bowlers in the next match, where Sri Lanka won the match by 6 wickets. The last group match was against Kenya, Sri Lanka recorded the highest team total in that time by scoring 398/5, Aravinda again played a gem of an inning with 145 runs. This score was the highest score by a Sri Lankan player in the World Cup.
In the first quarter finals, Sri Lanka played with England, where Sanath devastated the English players with his fast 82 runs just off 44 balls. Sri Lanka won the match by 5 wickets and progressed through to their first semi finals in the World Cup. Sri Lanka met India again in the semi-final, and the match was played in Kolkata, at the Eden Gardens, under the eyes of a lot of Indian fans. Sri Lanka came into bat first, but their first three wickets were taken very early. But then, Aravinda and Roshan Mahanama paced the innings with their half-centuries. Skipper Arjuna and Hashan Tillakaratne also played valuable innings. Indian pacer Javagal Srinath took 3 wickets.
Sri Lanka finished with 251/8 in 50 overs, giving Indians a good chance of winning the match. But the Sri Lankan bowling was so good, Navjot Singh Sidhu and skipper Mohammad Azharuddin got out very early. Sachin Tendulkar along with Sanjay Manjrekar slowly built the innings, but their wickets gave Sri Lanka a big chance of winning. When India was 120/8, the Indian fans got aggressive, throwing bottles and other materials into the ground, where the match could not be continued further. The umpires went onto a discussion with both teams and decided to award the match to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka went on to their first finals in World Cup history.
The finals was against Australia led by Mark Taylor at Gaddafi Stadium , Lahore . Before the match, former 1992 Cricket World Cup winning captain Imran Khan talked with Sri Lankan captain Ranatunga, stating that if they won the toss, to choose batting first. This was because the ground was more favorable to batting first and bowling under lights. In the toss however, Ranatunga won the match, but chose to field first. After a blazing start from captain Mark Taylor and young superstar and future captain Ricky Ponting , Australia fell from being 1–137 to 5–170 after which Sri Lanka's four prong spin attack took its toll. After Australia crashed to a 7–241 in its quota of 50 overs, Sri Lanka overcame a nervous start where they lost both openers before the score was 30, to win in 45 overs. Sri Lankan batting sensation Aravinda played a match-winning knock of 107, not out, and was assisted ably by fellow veterans Asanka Gurusinha (65) and captain Ranatunga (47*). De Silva was named man of the match after he had taken 3–42 in his 10 overs eairlier in the Australian innings & Sanath Jayasuriya got man of the series award.
Sri Lankan cricket's greatest moment undoubtedly came during the aforementioned 1996 World Cup , when they defeated the top-ranked Australian team under the leadership of Arjuna Ranatunga in the finals. Sri Lanka's game style over the course of the series revolutionised One Day International Cricket, and was characterised by the highly aggressive batting of their openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana in the first fifteen overs of the innings to take advantage of the fielding restrictions imposed during this period. This strategy has since become a hallmark of One Day International cricket.
1999 Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
1999 Cricket World Cup hosted by England and Netherlands, where Sri Lanka came as defending champions. Ranatunga against lead the team with 1996 World Cup winning members - Jayasuriya, Muralitharan , Mahanama, Hashan, Kalu, Vaas , Aravinda, Pramodya and Upul Chandana . They grouped in Group A with South Africa, India, Zimbabwe, England and Kenya.
Sri Lanka played their first group match with England, where they only scored 204 bowled out in 48.2 overs. the high bouncing pitches gave the subcontinent players a real headache. England won the match comfortably by 8 wickets. In the second group match, against South Africa, they played badly. By chasing 199 runs of South Africa, Sri Lanka only scored 110 runs, only Mahanama scored 36 runs. Against Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka finally won the match by 4 wickets. Zimbabwe only scored 197/9 and Sri Lanka scored 198/6. Next match was with India, where they posted 373/6 in total with Sourav Ganguly played a magnificent 183 runs in 158 balls. Sri Lanka played only 216/10, and India won by 157 runs. With this loss, Sri Lanka eliminated from the World Cup. Being the champions in last World Cup, this world cup campaign was really disappointed. Their last match was against Kenyans, where Sri Lanka won the match by 45 runs.
2003 Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
2003 Cricket World Cup was moved to the African continent, where South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the tournament. Sanath Jayasuriya lead the team. The team was grouped in Pool B with South Africa, New Zealand, West Indies, Bangladesh, Canada and Kenya. The first match was against New Zealand, where Blackcaps captain Stephen Fleming won the toss and sent Sri Lanka in to bat first. Sri Lanka’s opening batsmen- Jayasuriya and Marvan Atapattu were going strong and kept a steady run rate until the fifth over when they conceded their first wicket. Skipper Jayasuriya dominated the Blackcaps bowling attack by scoring 120 runs. The final score at the end of the innings was 272/7. The second innings didn’t start very well for New Zealand, losing their opening batsman, Nathan Astle , in the first over and captain Flemming in the second. The first real form of excitement came for New Zealand supporters when Styris and Cairns start hitting a few boundaries. Scott Styris overpassed Jayasuriya's batting by his 141 runs, but New Zealand all out for 217 in the total. Sri Lanka won by 47 runs and Jayasuriya was named man of the match.
Next match was against Bangladesh, where Chaminda Vaas became the only bowler to claim a hat tricks in the first three balls of any form of international cricket when he took the first three wickets off the opening three balls of the match. With this feat, Vaas became the third of only four players to have achieved two hat tricks. Bangladesh poorly scored 124/10. Sri Lankan opening batsmen reached the target without a wicket falling. At the very next match against Canada, Sri Lanka again involved for a World record, where Canada total of 36 was the lowest total in World Cup history and second lowest in all ODIs. Sri Lanka comfortably won the match by 9 wickets.
All these World Record matches next became a desperate sad for all the Sri Lankans. They lost the match to underdog Kenyans for the first time. The match was at Kenyan soil , Kenya batted first and scored Kennedy Otieno scored 60 runs. Murali took 4 wickets and Vaas with 3 wickets. Sri Lanka came to bat, only Aravinda scored 41 runs. All the others scored less than 30. Sri Lanka all out for just 157 runs in 45 overs. This was the first time that, Sri Lanka lost a match to affiliate nation. Against West Indies, Sri Lanka back in the game, where they chased 222 runs and won the match by 4 wickets. Last group match was against South Africa, Sri Lanka batted first and scored 268/9. South Africa was at 229/6 when rain came. According to Duckworth–Lewis method , match was tied. Finally Sri Lanka reached top of the Pool B, and selected for the quarter finals.
In the quarter finals, they lost to Australia and India, only won over Zimbabwe. This result gave them fourth place in standings, where Kenya recorded first semi-final occasion in the history. Sri Lanka's semi-final was against Australia. On a difficult, slow pitch at Port Elizabeth, Australia struggled their way to 212 (7 wickets, 50 overs) against tight Sri Lankan bowling, thanks mainly to a great innings from Andrew Symonds (91* from 118 balls, 7 fours, 1 six), demonstrating again captain Ricky Ponting's faith in him. Vaas, continuing his excellent tournament, took three wickets. Australia's pace attack then ripped through the Sri Lankan top order, with Brett Lee (3/35 in 8 overs) taking three early wickets and Glenn McGrath (1/20 in 7 overs) taking one. By the time rain arrived in the 39th over, continued tight bowling had squeezed Sri Lanka to 123 (7 wickets, 38.1 overs), well behind the target given by the Duckworth–Lewis method. This is the match in which Adam Gilchrist famously "walked" despite being given not out.
2007 Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
West Indies islands hosted the 9th Cricket World Cup , where Sri Lanka was lead by Mahela Jayawardena . The 12 teams were grouped into four groups, where Sri Lanka in group B. India, Bangladesh and Bermuda played with Sri Lanka in group matches. Bermuda's World Cup debut became the second-heaviest defeat at the World Cup, 40 runs worse than Scotland's defeat the day before. After Sri Lanka won the toss and batted, they scored 321/6 in 50 overs while skipper Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Chamara Silva all collected half-centuries. Kevin Hurdle took two wickets for Bermuda, but his second over lasted 14 balls due to no-balls and wides. Bermuda fell to 20 for four after Lasith Malinga had taken three wickets in three overs, ending with bowling figures of three for 10. With the seven first men down, Lionel Cann paired up with Delyone Borden for a 25-run partnership, the largest of the innings. Farveez Maharoof removed both before Murali had Dwayne Leverock lbw to end the innings for 78, Bermuda's lowest total ever in One-day Internationals. Sri Lanka won the match by 243 runs.
Next match for Sri Lanka was against Bangladesh, who won the match against India and was in good performance before coming to this match. But Bangladesh' chances of reaching the Super Eights by means of net run rate diminished after a 198-run defeat to Sri Lanka, the third-heaviest of their history and the largest since their 200-run defeat to India in 2003. Indeed, it was only due to the rain during Bangladesh' innings and the consequently readjusted target that the margin of victory was smaller; Bangladesh were bowled out for 112, with all the Sri Lankan bowlers except Jayasuriya taking wickets, but Jayasuriya had already contributed with seven sixes in his 24th One-day International century as Sri Lanka totalled 318 for four. Spinners Mohammad Rafique and Abdur Razzak were the only ones to keep the economy rate below five an over, while for Sri Lanka only Russel Arnold cost more than five an over. Four Sri Lankan batsmen outscored Bangladesh' top-scoring batsman, Mohammad Ashraful , who made 45 not out from number seven.
Last group match was against the neighbors-India, who was at brink of eliminating from the tournament. So the match was highly valuable to Indians than Lankans. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, went through to the second stage unbeaten, after newcomers to the team Upul Tharanga and Chamara Silva both struck half-centuries and Murali took three wickets, including wicket-keeper MS Dhoni for a duck.
Indian pacer Zaheer Khan started off with a wide, but also had Jayasuriya caught behind in his opening spell, striking at the end of the seventh over, and also had Tharanga in trouble with in-cutters. Tharanga, however, batted through nearly two thirds of the match for his 64, and none of the bowlers managed to keep the run rate below four as Sri Lanka made it to 254 for six, due to poor cricket from India. For Sri Lanka, Vaas struck twice within eleven overs, taking a return catch off Robin Uthappa and having Ganguly caught for a 23-ball seven. Tendulkar followed in the next over, bowled by Dilhara Fernando for his second duck of the tournament, but Virender Sehwag and skipper Rahul Dravid made it through the next ten overs, before the "turning point" arrived when Murali had Sehwag caught at first slip in his third over; the next six overs yielded only 14 runs and two more wickets, after Dhoni went lbw to Murali, and India needed 141 runs off 22 overs. Despite double-digit scores from Ajit Agarkar , Harbhajan Singh and Munaf Patel , they were bowled out for 185. India eliminated and Sri Lanka through to Super 8s.
Super 8s has gone pretty well for Sri Lankans, with their performances, only lost to South Africa and Australia. In the first Super 8 match for Sri Lanka vs South Africa, Malinga became the first bowler to take four wickets with four consecutive deliveries in international cricket. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat, and lost their first five wickets for 98, with Charl Langeveldt taking two in his first spell. Tillakaratne Dilshan and Russel Arnold built a sixth-wicket stand of 97 in nearly 20 overs, but Dilshan was caught off Makhaya Ntini 's bowling, and then Langeveldt took 3 in 5 balls as Sri Lanka were bowled out in the final over for 209. In reply, Vaas had AB de Villiers bowled in the first over, but Jacques Kallis added 95 with Graeme Smith and 65 with Herschelle Gibbs , leading South Africa to within four runs of victory with his 86. Then Lasith Malinga struck and show begun. His four-in-four had Shaun Pollock , Andrew Hall , Kallis and Ntini. Though South Africa managed a run off Vaas in the intermediate over. South Africa now needed three runs to win with one wicket in hand, and eleven deliveries went by before Robin Peterson got an outside edge to a Malinga ball, which went out of reach of slip and went fine for four. South Africa won the match by only 1 wicket, in a very tied game. With this feat, Lasith Malinga became the only bowler to get four consecutive wickets in four balls in any form of the game.
Next match was against the hosts-West Indies. The start of the match was delayed due to bad weather, but a full 50-over match was played, which resulted in West Indies' third defeat in four days. Jayasuriya and Jayawardene added 183 for the third wicket, before Dilshan came in and took 39 off 22 deliveries as the final eleven overs yielded 84 runs. In reply, West Indies needed 170 off 94 when Ramnaresh Sarwan was stumped off Jayasuriya; they only got 56 of those, and were bowled out for 190, with four batsmen out in single figures. Sri Lanka won the match by huge 113 runs.
Against England, the match was again became a nail biter. Sri Lanka batted first and made 235, bowled out off the last ball with a run out. England lost their openers for 0 and 10, but Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen made a stand of 90 for the third wicket, and skipper Paul Collingwood joined Pietersen to add a further 25 before Pietersen was caught and bowled by Murali. England then lost two more wickets for seven runs to Dilhara Fernando, and required 103 off 16.3 overs with four wickets in hand. However, Ravi Bopara scored a half-century in his fourth One-Day International innings, as he and Paul Nixon took England within three runs of victory. However, Fernando returned for the last over, and bowled Bopara off the last ball giving Sri Lanka victory. Sri Lanka won two of last three matches -won against New Zealand and Ireland, lost to Australia, secured their place to semi-finals.
In the semi, Sri Lanka met New Zealand again, where Sri Lanka scored 289/7 courtesy of century by skipper Jayawardena. New Zealand only scored 208 runs and eliminated from the World Cup. Sri Lanka selected for their second final in World Cups, against same opponent as in 1996-Australians. Aussie skipper Ricky Ponting won the toss and elected to bat. However, the start of play was delayed due to rain, and the match was reduced to 38 overs per side. Gilchrist played an incredible innings of 149 – the highest for any batsman in a World Cup final – to give Australia an imposing total going in at the break., but the innings was in controversy due to Gilchrist usage of squash ball inside the left glove.
While Sri Lankan batsmen Sangakkara and Jayasuriya were adding 116 for the second wicket, the contest was alive, but after the pair got out, Sri Lanka's chances slowly diminished. Further rain forced the reduction of Sri Lanka's innings to just 36 overs, with the target revised to 269. At the end of the 33rd over, with Sri Lanka still trailing the adjusted D/L target by 37 runs, the umpires suspended the game due to bad light. While Australia's players began to celebrate their victory (since the minimum 20 overs had been reached), the umpires incorrectly announced that because the match was suspended due to light and not rain, the final three overs would have to be bowled the following day. With Sri Lanka needing 61 runs from 18 deliveries, Jayawardene agreed there was no need to return the following day, and instructed his team to resume batting, with Ponting agreeing to play only spinners. The umpires later apologised for their error: the match should have ended then with Australia winning by 37 runs. The last three overs were played in almost complete darkness, during which Sri Lanka added just nine runs, giving Australia a 53-run victory by the D-L method, as Sri Lanka had batted two overs fewer than they had.

Canada bowled well in the early overs, but did not get a wicket, as openers Tharanga and Dilshan reached 50 runs. When the first wicket did fall, it was a run-out when the batsmen had a mix-up with the score at 63, and Tharanga was dismissed. Dilshan got to his half-century, but fell trying to go for a big hit. The Canadians restricted Sri Lanka to 88/2 with over 19 overs bowled; but the two experienced Sri Lankan batsmen, captain Sangakkara and Jayawardene came together and got a partnership of 50.

Jayawardene reached his century but fell immediately afterwards. More wickets fell and the game got hot-tempered, with a confrontation between Angelo Mathews and Harvir Baidwan and Sri Lanka finished with 332/7.
The Canadian chase went nowhere, with Thisara Perera and Nuwan Kulasekara getting three wickets quickly. Captain Ashish Bagai tried to lead a recovery, but once Perera took his wicket to reduce Canada to 53/5, all doubts about the result finished. Big-hitter Rizwan Cheema took 37, including two huge sixes off spinner Murali, but the latter ultimately got his wicket as Canada fell to 122 all out. Sri Lanka won the match by 210 runs.
Next match was with Pakistani team, which gave Lankans their first World Cup defeat in home soil. Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi won the toss and decided to bat first against Sri Lanka, one of the pre-tournament favorites.

Misbah stayed not out till the end for a well made 83, kept Pakistan to 277/7 at the end.
Sri Lanka started off with a very good reply, with their openers Tharanga and Dilshan accelerating steadily after a slow start to add 76 in just over 14 overs until Hafeez had Tharanga caught at point. This was the turning point of the match, as three more wickets, including that of Dilshan fell soon after to leave Sri Lanka tottering at 96/4. Sangakkara rode his luck with Kamran missing two stumpings off him, and staged a recovery with Chamara Silva, but his luck eventually ran out as the required run rate went up, with Afridi having him caught at long on one short of his fifty. Jayawadena was bowled by pacer Shoaib Akhtar with a magnificent in swing. Silva struggled to time the ball early in his innings, being 16 off 49 balls at one point, but he then accelerated rapidly to reach his half-century, but Afridi returned to remove dangerous looking Angelo Mathews. Silva eventually fell for 57 when Kamran did get a stumping right, and despite Kulasekara's cameo, Sri Lanka ended up 11 short.
In the next match against Kenyans, Malinga took a hat-trick, the second in his career. He became the first bowler to take two World Cup hat-tricks, and the fourth bowler to take two career ODI hat-tricks. Sri Lanka comfortably chased the target of 146b by giving one wicket only.

In reply, Zimbabwe made a good start, but were dismissed for 188 runs with 11 overs spare.

Skipper Sangakkara scored 111 runs and Lankans managed to get 265/9. Blackcaps were struggled from the very first ball, where they were all out for 153.
In the quarter finals, Sri Lankan counterpart was England. England total of 229 was easily reached by Dilshan and Tharanga. Both made centuries as Sri Lanka chased down a target by ten wickets.

This was the last match Murali played on Sri Lankan soil. Sri Lanka won the match by 5 wickets and reached their first consecutive World Cup final.
Sri Lanka started the innings slowly, constrained by good bowling from Zaheer and committed fielding from Yuvraj Singh , Suresh Raina , and Virat Kohli inside the 30-yard circle. Zaheer began with three consecutive maidens and the wicket of Tharanga, conceding only six runs in his five-over spell. Dilshan was bowled by Harbhajan when a delivery carried on to the stumps after deflecting off his gloves. Sangakkara came in after Tharanga's dismissal, and was building a solid foundation with Dilshan before the latter was dismissed. Jayawardene came to the crease when Sri Lanka were 60/2 in the 17th over. Sangakkara and Mahela went about the task of consolidating the innings, but eventually Sangakkara was caught behind by Dhoni at 48. New batsman Thilan Samaraweera was adjudged not out by the umpire when a ball hit his thigh pad off the bowling of Yuvraj Singh. The Indians decided to review the decision and he was ultimately given out. Chamara Kapugedera , who was playing his first World Cup match, was caught off a deceptive slower ball by Zaheer Khan. Jayawardene, meanwhile, continued with his quality batting, ultimately scoring 103 not out from 88 balls in a high-class batting display. Helped by the hard-hitting of Kulasekara and Thisara, Sri Lanka scored 91 runs in the last 10 overs, including 63 in the batting powerplay (45–50 overs) to take the score to 274/6.
India had a shaky start, with Sehwag and Tendulkar both early by Malinga, leaving them struggling at 31 for two. Kohli and Gautam Gambhir started the recovery with some fluent stroke play and quick running between wickets, taking India to 114 before Kohli was caught-and-bowled by Dilshan for 35. When he was on 30, Gambhir mistimed a shot off the bowling of Suraj Randiv , sending the ball high up in the air, but Kulasekara could not hold on to a difficult chance at long off. Kohli and Gambhir put together an 83-run partnership before Kohli's dismissal. Dhoni came in after Kohli to bat at number five. Gambhir and Dhoni added 109 for the fourth wicket with Gambhir scoring 97. Gambhir tried to finish his century with a boundary, but was bowled by Thisara.

This is the first World Twenty20 tournament held in an Asian country, the last three having been held in South Africa, England and the West Indies.

The Sri Lankan third consecutive World T20 semi-final was against Pakistanis. Sri Lanka scored 139/4, where Mahela paced the innings with his 42 runs. While chasing, skipper Mohammad Hafeez scored 40 runs, all the other players were undone by Rangana Herath.

They then restricted Sri Lanka to 39/1 after eight overs, produced two run outs and held each Sri Lankan batsman to no more than 33 (posted by captain Mahela Jayawardene). Kulasekara mustered a brief fightback (26 runs from 16 balls) but holed out to leave the tail end exposed, and Sri Lanka was soon all out 36 runs short. Samuels earned Man of the Match honors for being the top-scoring batsman on either side while also taking 1-15 in his four overs of bowling. For the first time, a host nation (Sri Lanka) competed in the final of the ICC World Twenty20. Ajantha Mendis was the highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets.
2014 ICC World Twenty20[ edit ]
As the runner-up of previous World T20 competition, Sri Lanka went Bangladesh under the captaincy of Dinesh Chandimal to this edition of World T20 . In the group stage at Super 10 stage, they played with South Africa, New Zealand, England, and Netherlands. In the first match, Sri Lanka played with South Africa. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat first. They had a good understanding about Bangladeshi pitches, due to Bangladesh bilateral tournament and 2014 Asia Cup , which was held prior to the World T20 at the same site. Sri Lankan opener Kusal Perera reminded all sorts of aggressive shots by legendary Sanath Jayasuriya. Kusal's master stroke was a photocopy of Jayasuriya and he devastated Dale Steyn , Morné Morkel , and Lonwabo Tsotsobe . He scored 61 runs off 40 balls giving Sri Lanka a total of 165/7. South Africans was not down as yet, where they progressively built the innings. With the wickets in crucial intervals, they ended up in the losing side with 5 runs short. Kusal was the Man-of-the-Match.
The next match was against talented Netherlands, who show their powerful strokes against Ireland in this tournament. But all those stroke play was undone by magnificent bowling by Mathews, Kulasekara, and Malinga. Dutch were all out for 39 runs, which is the lowest by any team in a T20I match . Sri Lanka chased this easy target by 5 overs, which also earns Biggest victory in terms of balls remaining in all T20I.
In the very next match against England, beat Sri Lanka by 6 wickets with courtesy of unbeaten 116 by Alex Hales . Sri Lanka batted first and scored 189/4. Mahela scored 89 runs. England always maintained the required run rate very well, which gave them a fast hitting in last few overs. England scored 190/4 in 19.2 and won the match.
The last group match was a thrilling match for the both teams, where Sri Lanka came as the favorites to win the match. Skipper Chandimal was out of play due to some injuries, so Lasith Malinga captained the match. By batting first, Sri Lanka scored only 119 all out, Mahela scored 25 runs as the best batsman. Blackcaps came to the crease as the favorites to win the match, because 120 is not a huge task at all to them as smashers - Brendon McCullum , Martin Guptill , Ross Taylor , and Corey Anderson . During the match, Anderson was injured and so New Zealand played with only 10 players in batting. New Zealand started pretty well with Guptill and Kane Williamson . At this time, Malinga decided to go with Rangana Herath , who turned the match in nowhere. Herath ball Guptill and he lunges forward to push to mid-on. Sets off for a single straight away but his partner is not at all interested. The bowler is wise to the mistake, rushes across to his right and cuts the ball in its path and sends in a rocket throw and Sangakkara whips the bails off. After this run-out, it wall all Herath. he stumped skipper McCullum, then caught Ross Taylor to lbw. Next, Herath bowled James Neesham in first ball he faced. He then captured Luke Ronchi for lbw, and New Zealand were never in the game. Finally New Zealand all out for just 60 runs, which is the lowest score by a test playing nation in Twenty20 Internationals. Herath finished with 5 wickets for 3 runs, earned him Man-of-the-match. With this win, Sri Lanka moved their fourth consecutive World T20 semi-finals.
The semi-finals was against defending World T20 champions- West Indies. Malinga again lead the team. But this time, Lankans were all over West Indies, where Sri Lanka scored 160/6. In chasing, West Indies was 80/4 when rain came into play. Rain and hail ended the match after 13.5 overs in the West Indies' innings. Their par score was 107 runs according to the Duckworth–Lewis method. So, Sri Lanka won by 27 runs in D/L method. At the presentation, West Indies skipper Darren Sammy stated that, "rain and god gave Sanga and Mehela" a big farewell party. This World Cup belongs to them. So, good luck to both of them". The final was not easy at all, with their opposition being a difficult one - India. The match was lead by Malinga for third time, where he gave permanent T20I captaincy.
Sri Lanka and India had played each other over sixty times in the last seven years, with India winning the majority of the matches. During the tournament India was the only unbeaten team heading into the final, whereas Sri Lanka had lost a group match to England. Despite this, statistically there had been little between the two teams during the tournament. India, sent into bat by Sri Lanka after they won the toss, posted 130 runs in their 20 overs. Virat Kohli top scored with 77, but Yuvraj Singh's 11 runs off 21 balls slowed the innings momentum in the final overs. Sri Lanka reached 134 runs in 17.5 overs with the loss of 4 wickets. Kumar Sangakkara, playing his last Twenty20 international match, guided Sri Lanka home with an unbeaten 52 runs. Sangakkara was named Player of the Match, while Kohli was named Player of the Tournament. After all losses in major World Cups in 4 times, Sri Lanka finally ended with Champions. With this match, Mahela and Sanga retired from twenty20 internationals. The words of Sammy became true at last.

Lahiru Thirimanne scored 65 runs, and finally Sri Lanka bowled out for 233, with 98 runs lost at the end.
The next match was against debut World Cup contestants- Afghanistan. Afghanistan got off to a solid start before both their openers were dismissed off consecutive overs and the score read 40/2 in the tenth over. Asghar Stanikzai and Samiullah Shenwari built a steady third-wicket partnership which was broken when Afghanistan had reached 128 in the 28th over. Following this, Afghanistan started losing wickets at regular intervals to the Sri Lankan pace bowlers before finally being bowled out for 232 in 49.4 overs. Malinga and Mathews picked 3 wickets each for Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka's innings got off to a disastrous start as both openers fell for ducks within the second over, which was the second time in ODI history where this has occurred. Then in the sixth over, they lost the wicket of Sangakkara with the score at 18/3. They slipped into further trouble when Dimuth Karunaratne was dismissed in the 12th over with the Sri Lankan total still at 51. Then the maestro Jayawardene came to the crease. He and Mathews then added 126 runs for the fifth wicket and Mathews was run out for 44 and Jayawardene was dismissed soon after completing his 19th ODI hundred. Thisara, who came in to bat with Sri Lanka in a precarious position of 178/6, struck an unbeaten 47 from 26 balessure on Lee to win back his place and as a result, he spends many months in the sidelines as a twelfth man.
2005
A lifeline
Returns to the Test line-up after an 18-month hiatus. Bowls his heart out in the 2005 Ashes in England, taking 20 wickets in five games. The decline of Kasprowicz and Jason Gillespie gives Lee a lifeline. Nearly wins the Edgbaston Thriller with the bat. Returns to top form against West Indies later that year, leading the wicket charts with 18 wickets at 20.94.

A day Australia feared at lunch would become impossible turned into something less intimidating by stumps. Not that the tourists had reason to be pleased. Just that there was relief in the camp following the earlier desperation.
Australia's mid-day fightback prevented them from being out of the game and a couple of hours later an Indian total of 311 for 5 felt like the situation was almost even. The home side is well ahead, but Australia will remain in the contest if they can dismiss the hosts quickly on the second morning. Given the pitch's current condition even that could be a tough ask.
India's batsmen showed their might on a surface made for them and Australia's attack, which was missing Stuart Clark and carried a debutant in Peter Siddle, struggled for impact at the beginning and the end. The first hour felt like the opening of a one-day game, with Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir slashing at any bowling misdirection and racing to 70 in the 15th over.
Despite a brief and unexpected rally of 3 for 17 in the middle session, the day finished as it had begun - with India in control. "We actually finished off alright, five wickets for only 311 in the end," Siddle said. "When considering in the first session they were 1 for 150 at one stage, we came out of it in not a bad position."
Siddle experienced the sort of return a fast bowler playing his 13th first-class match could have expected. He showed zippy speed and flashes of hope, the same ones which have impressed the selectors who want him to be a long-term option, but was not helped by the tendency to lose his line. At this level, against these batsmen, there isn't any margin to lapse. He recognised the "massive step up" in intensity but started to relax in his second spell.
In one over in the morning to Rahul Dravid, Siddle could not believe a reasonable ball had been flicked to square leg for four. He just stared at the batsman in disbelief. Later in the over a fuller ball went to the midwicket boundary. Life at this level is tough. Bowling at Sachin Tendulkar was harder, but more rewarding.
Siddle kept sprinting in without success until he picked up Tendulkar in his first over with the second new ball. Two fours were followed by a play and a miss and an edge to Matthew Hayden at first slip. It was a satisfying note after he had been the bowler operating when Tendulkar became the game's highest run-scorer.
"It being me puts me in the record books," Siddle said. "To get him out is a great thrill, a real privilege."
Showing an old-school fast bowler's outlook, he started his Test career with a fierce, short delivery around 140kph that was perfect. Gambhir took his eyes off the ball as he ducked, providing Siddle with his first scalp.
"I went with the bouncer and it wasn't a bad first delivery," he said. "I think I broke his helmet, so that's always pleasing." Brett Lee used to speak like that too.
The Australians talk about bowling in partnerships,I retire, I am keeping all my options open." [301]
In November 2014, Kohli and Anjana Reddy's Universal Sportsbiz (USPL) launched a youth fashion brand 'WROGN'. The brand is set to produce men's casual wear clothing in 2015 and has tied up with Myntra and Shopper's Stop . [302] [303]
In 2015, Kohli invested ₹90 crore to start a chain of gyms and fitness centres across the country. Launched under the name "Chisel", the chain of gyms is jointly owned by Kohli, Chisel India and CSE (Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment), the agency which manages Kohli's commercial interests. [304]
In September 2015, Kohli became a co-owner of the International Premier Tennis League franchise UAE Royals . [305]
Endorsements
Kohli was signed up by sports agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after the 2008 Under-19 World Cup. Sajdeh recalls, "I didn’t go after them after they became stars. In fact, I watched Virat at the 2008 ICC Under-19 World Cup in Kuala Lumpur. I was mighty impressed with his attitude and the way he was marshalling his team. He had that spark. And I told Yuvi to set up the meeting." [306] Sajdeh manages Kohli's endorsement deals, along with those of other Indian cricketers Shikhar Dhawan , Rohit Sharma and Murali Vijay . Kohli currently has brand endorsements worth over ₹100 crore. His bat deal with MRF is said to be the costliest deal in Indian cricket history. He was also reportedly offered ₹100 crore for a ten-year deal by an apparel brand. [306] In 2014, the UK-based magazine SportsPro rated Kohli as the second most marketable athlete in the world behind only Lewis Hamilton , placing him above the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo , Lionel Messi and Usain Bolt . [6]
As of January 2015, Kohli has endorsements with 11 brands: PepsiCo , Boost , Munch (from Nestle ), Clear hair care ( Unilever ), Royal Challenge (from United Spirits ), Adidas , MRF, Mattel , Oakley , TVS Motors and Vicks . [307] The brands Kohli previously had endorsements with include Fastrack (from Titan ), Sangam Suitings, Fair and Lovely , Herbalife , Flying Machine, Red Chief Shoes, Toyota Motors , Celkon Mobiles , Cinthol (from Godrej ) and 3C Company. [308] [309]
Charity
In March 2013, Kohli started a charity foundation called 'Virat Kohli Foundation' (VKF). The organisation aims at helping underprivileged kids and conducts events to raise funds for the charity. [310] According to Kohli, the foundation works with select NGOs to "create awareness, seek support and raise funds for the various causes they endorse and the philanthropic work they engage in." [311] In May 2014, eBay and Save the Children India conducted a charity auction with VKF, and directed the funds generated towards the education and healthcare of underprivileged children. [312]

Recognition[ edit ]
In 2002, Wisden carried out a statistical analysis of all Test matches in an effort to rate the greatest cricketers in history, and Muralitharan was ranked as the best Test bowler of all time. [4] However, two years earlier, Muralitharan was not named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Century . Former Australian captain Steve Waugh called him "the Don Bradman of bowling". [146]
Muralitharan was selected as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2000 and in 2006. [147]
On 15 November 2007, the Warne-Muralidaran Trophy was unveiled named after the two leading wicket-takers in Test cricket, Shane Warne and Muralitharan. The trophy displays images of the two spin bowlers' hands each holding a cricket ball. This trophy will be contested between Australia and Sri Lanka in all future Test series. [148]
On 3 December 2007, just hours after Muttiah Muralitharan became Test cricket's leading Test wicket-taker, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) announced it had unveiled a portrait of the Sri Lanka off-spinner at Lord's . [149] On the same day the Philatelic Bureau of the Department of Posts in Sri Lanka issued a circular stamp with a denomination of Rs. 5 to mark the world record set by Muttiah Muralitharan. The circular design was meant to denote the cricket ball. [150]
Australian musician Alston Koch provoked worldwide interest when he recorded the only official tribute song to Muralitharan. The song was even mentioned on the BBC's Test Match Special . [151] [152] The Muralitharan Song video was also released after he broke the world record.
On 10 January 2008, the Parliament of Sri Lanka felicitated Muttiah Muralitharan for his world record breaking feat of being the highest wicket taker in Test cricket. [153] This was the first time that a sportsman had been honoured in the country's Supreme Legislature. [154]
The Central Provincial Council in Kandy has decided to rename the International Cricket Stadium in Pallekele after Muttiah Muralitharan. [155]
Controversy of bowling action[ edit ]
Throughout much of his international career, Muralitharan's action was suspected of contravening the laws of the game by the straightening of his bowling arm during delivery . Although he was cited three times, subsequent biomechanical testing led the ICC to clear him of the charge and permit him to continue bowling.
Biomechanical testing conducted on four occasions fueled debate as to whether his action was in fact illegal or actually an illusion created by his allegedly unique ability to generate extra movement both at the shoulder as well the wrist, which enables him to bowl the doosra without straightening the elbow. [156] [157]
First throwing citation and testing[ edit ]
Muttiah Muralitharan bowling in SCG for ICC World XI
Initial concerns as to whether Muralitharan's action contravened the laws of the game by straightening his bowling arm during delivery broke into open controversy after Australian umpire Darrell Hair called a " no ball " for an illegal action seven times during the Boxing Day Test match in Melbourne , Australia, in 1995. Australian Sir Donald Bradman , universally regarded as the greatest batsman in history, was later quoted as saying it was the "worst example of umpiring that [he had] witnessed, and against everything the game stands for. Clearly Murali does not throw the ball". [158] [159]
Ten days later, on 5 January 1996, Sri Lanka played the West Indies in the seventh ODI of the triangular World Series competition, in Brisbane. Umpire Ross Emerson officiating in his debut international match, no-balled Muralitharan three times in his first over, twice in his second and twice in his third. It was an identical tally to that called by Hair on Boxing Day and (like Hair) Emerson made his calls from the bowler's end while his partner stood silent. The main difference was that several no-balls were for leg-breaks instead of the bowler's normal off-breaks.
In February 1996, just before the world cup Muralitharan underwent biomechanical analysis at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Ravindra Goonetilleke, who declared his action legal in the conditions tested, citing a congenital defect in Muralitharan's arm which makes him incapable of fully straightening it, but giving the appearance of fully straightening the arm. Although under the original Laws a bowler's arm did not need to be fully straightened to be in breach of a legal delivery. [160] [161] They concluded that his action created the 'optical illusion of throwing'. Based on this evidence ICC gave clearance to Muralitharan to continue bowling. [9]
Second citation and testing[ edit ]
Doubts about Muralitharan's action persisted, however. On the 1998–99 tour to Australia he was once again called for throwing by Ross Emerson during a One Day International against England at the Adelaide Oval in Australia. The Sri Lankan team almost abandoned the match, but after instructions from the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka, the game resumed. [162] The Sri Lankan captain at the time Arjuna Ranatunga , was later fined and given a suspended ban from the game as a result. [163] It later emerged that at the time of this match Emerson was on sick leave from his non-cricket job due to a stress-related illness and he stood down for the rest of the series. [164] Muralitharan was sent for further tests in Perth and England and was cleared again. [9] At no stage was Muralitharan requested to change or remodel his action, by the ICC. Up to this point in his career (1999) Muralitharan primarily bowled two types of deliveries, namely the off-break and the topspinner . He had not yet mastered the doosra.
Third citation and testing[ edit ]
Muralitharan continued bowling, taking his 500th Test wicket in the second Test against Australia in Kandy on 16 March 2004. At the end of the series his doosra delivery was officially called into question by match referee Chris Broad . At the University of Western Australia (Department of Human Movement and Exercise Science), three-dimensional kinematic measurements of Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling arm were taken using an optical motion capture system while he bowled his doosra. Muralitharan's mean elbow extension angle for the doosra delivery was 14°, which was subsequently reduced to a mean of 10.2° after remedial training at the University. The findings reported to ICC by the University of Western Australia 's study [165] was that Muralitharan's doosra contravened the established ICC elbow extension limit of 5° for spinners. [13] [166] [167]
Under the original throwing Laws of Cricket, the umpires officiating were under an obligation to call "no-ball" to a delivery that they were not entirely happy was absolutely fair. This Law gave the umpires absolutely no discretion. In 2000, the Laws were changed to put an allowable figure of straightening of 5° for spinners, 7.5° for medium pacers and 10° for fast bowlers in an attempt to more clearly define what was legal. [168] But these figures proved difficult to enforce due to umpires being unable to discern actual amounts of straightening and the differentiation between the three different allowable figures. Testing in Test Match conditions is not currently possible "when the identification of elbow and shoulder joint centres in on-field data collection, where a shirt is worn, also involves large errors. In a match the ability to differentiate anatomical movements such as 'elbow extension' by digitising segment end-points, particularly if you have segment rotations, is extremely difficult and prone to error. [14] This is certainly the case with spin bowlers. It is therefore not surprising that laboratory testing is preferred, particularly for spin bowlers, where an appropriate pitch length and run-up can be structured. This is clearly the only way to test players, where data would be able to withstand scientific and therefore legal scrutiny." [167]
An extensive ICC study, the results of which were released in November 2004, was conducted to investigate the "chucking issue". A laboratory kinematic analysis of 42 non-Test playing bowlers done by Ferdinands and Kersting (2004) established that the 5° limit for slow and spin bowlers was particularly impractical. [169]
Due to the overwhelming scientific findings, researchers recommended that a flat rate of 15° tolerable elbow extension be used to define a preliminary demarcation point between bowling and throwing. A panel of former Test players consisting of Aravinda de Silva , Angus Fraser , Michael Holding , Tony Lewis , Tim May and the ICC's Dave Richardson , with the assistance of several biomechanical experts, stated that 99% of all bowlers in the history of cricket straighten their arms when bowling. [170] Only one player tested (part-time bowler Ramnaresh Sarwan ) reportedly did not transgress the pre 2000 rules. [170] Many of these reports have controversially not been published and as such, the 99% figure stated has yet to be proved. In fact, Muralitharan stirred up controversy when he said during an interview with a Melbourne radio station that Jason Gillespie , Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee flexed their arms by 12, 13 and 14–15 degrees respectively, although it is unclear as to where Muralitharan quoted these figures from. Muralitharan was censured by the Sri Lankan Cricket Board for these comments. [171]
The ICC Executive was asked to ratify the panel's recommendations at the ICC's Annual General Meeting in February 2005. Based on the recommendations the ICC issued a new guideline (which was effective from 1 March 2005) allowing for extensions or hyperextensions of up to 15 degrees for all types of bowlers, thus deeming Muralitharan's doosra to be legal. [15] [172]
Explaining why the maximum level of 15 degrees was arrived at, panel member Angus Fraser stated "That is the number which biomechanics says that it (straightening) becomes visible. It is difficult for the naked eye to see less than 15 degrees in a bowler's action. We found when the biceps reached the shoulder the amount of bend was around 165 degrees. Very few bowlers can get to 180 degrees because the joint doesn't allow that. ... but once you go further than 15 degrees you get into an area which is starting to give you an unfair advantage and you are breaking the law". [172]
University of South Australia study[ edit ]
The original decision of disallowing the doosra bowling action was hailed widely as justifiable on account of being scientifically based. Hence, a team of Australian scientists [173] representing the University of South Australia conducted an independent research, in line with modern Artificial Intelligence and biomechanics in order to solve the controversial issue arise from doosra. The University of South Australia 's study, founded by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama , and contributed by Prof. Ozdemir Gol, Prof. J. Mazumdar, Prof. Tony Worsley and Prof. Lakmi Jain has analyzed the previous studies with close scrutiny since the techniques in their fields of expertise are employed in the course of assessment as the basis for decision-making. The findings based on this scientific study are overwhelming [173] and Dave Richardson , General Manager ICC stated that the ICC is currently reviewing the Law on throwing and the ICC regulations and the study done by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama with UniSA scientists [14] is a valuable source of information in this regard. [174] The team of Australian scientists including Sri Lankan-born Australian scientist, Prof. Mahinda Pathegama [173] reporting their findings, in line with the Muralitharan test to ICC, has analyzed in-depth various issues, such as Pitfalls in image interpretation when using 2D images for 3D modeling associates compared to the modern techniques in Artificial Intelligence and biomechanics , and Biomechanics assessment for doosra bowling action, etc. Pathegama at al. (2004) further reports on the Disagreement of expression on measurement accuracy in the Murali Report, with the analysis of the Motion tracking system used for the Murali Report, and discussing Cognitive aspects, Evidence of errors in Anthropometric assessment and movement tracking, Lateral inhibition in response tracking, Psycho-physiological aspect on post-assessments, Angular measurement errors, Skin marker induced errors, Geometrics-and physics-based 3D modeling and the Approach to on-field assessment, etc.
The Muralitharan Report produced by the University of Western Australia's study has considered the Richards study [175] done in 1999 to evaluate the error margin. University of South Australia 's study done by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama [173] argued that the Richards study which was presented by the University of Western Australia's study has used a rigid aluminium bar that only rotated in the horizontal plane to introduce such error margin. Pathegama 's report [14] stated that "in view of the system used in the test itself yielding considerable error even with a rigid aluminum bar (an accuracy level of approximately 4 degrees as stated in the Murali Report), it stands to reason that the error margin would be considerably larger when tracking skin markers on a spin bowler's moving upper limb by this same system".
Vincent Barnes in an interview argues [176] that Bruce Elliott, the UWA professor who is also the ICC biomechanist, had made an interesting discovery in his dealings with finger spinners. "He said he had found that a lot of bowlers from the subcontinent could bowl the doosra legally, but not Caucasian bowlers."
Fourth round of testing[ edit ]
On 2 February 2006, Muralitharan underwent a fourth round of biomechanical testing. There had been criticism that the previous round of tests in July 2004 did not replicate match conditions due to a slower bowling speed in the laboratory tests. The results showed that the average elbow flexation while bowling the 'doosra' delivery was 12.2 degrees, at an average of 53.75 mph (86.50 km/h). The average for his off-break was 12.9 degrees at 59.03 mph (95.00 km/h). [177]
Bowling with an arm brace[ edit ]
In July 2004 Muralitharan was filmed in England, bowling with an arm brace on. The film was shown on Britain's Channel 4 during the Test against England on 22 July 2004.
Initially, Muralitharan bowled three balls – the off-spinner, the top-spinner and the doosra – as he would in a match. Then he bowled the same three balls with a brace that is made from steel bars, which are set into strong resin. This brace has been moulded to his right arm, is approximately 46 centimetres long and weighs just under 1 kilogram.
TV presenter Mark Nicholas who tried the brace himself, confirmed that "There is no way an arm can be bent, or flexed, when it is in this brace." All three balls reacted in the same way as when bowled without the brace. They were not bowled quite so fast because the weight of the brace restricts the speed of Muralitharan's shoulder rotation, but the spin was still there.
With the brace on, there still appeared to be a jerk in his action. When studying the film at varying speeds, it still appeared as if he straightened his arm, even though the brace makes it impossible to do so. His unique shoulder rotation and amazing wrist action seem to create the illusion that he straightens his arm. [157]
The off-spinner said the exercise was to convince a sceptical public rather than sway an ICC investigation into bowling actions launched after he was reported by match referee Chris Broad for his doosra delivery in March 2004, the third time action was taken on his bowling. In an interview for August 2004 edition of Wisden Asia Cricket , Muralitharan stated "I think it will prove a point to those who had said that it was physically impossible to bowl a ball that turned the other way. I proved that it was possible to bowl the doosra without bending the arm." [178]
In 2004 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Muralitharan voluntarily performed a series of tests with live video cameras. Michael Slater and Ravi Shastri witnessed it all unfold. Muralitharan once again showed he could bowl all his deliveries including the doosra with an arm brace that prevents any straightening of his elbow. Orthopediatrician Dr Mandeep Dillon stated that Muralitharan's unusual ability to generate extra movement both at the shoulder as well the wrist enables him to bowl the doosra without straightening the elbow. [156]
Critics and converts[ edit ]
Two vocal critics of Muralitharan's action have been former test cricketers, Australian Dean Jones and Bishan Bedi , the former Indian captain. Dean Jones later admitted [179] to being wrong in his assessment of Murali when he witnessed first hand Murali bowling with an arm-brace on.
Michael Holding , the former West Indian fast bowler was also a critic of Muralitharan, but withdrew his criticisms under the light of the tests carried out. Holding had been quoted [180] as being in "110% agreement" with Bedi, who likened Murali's action to a "javelin throw" [181] and more recently, compared to a "shot putter". [182] Following the ICC study, as a member of the panel that conducted the study, Holding stated, "The scientific evidence is overwhelming ... When bowlers who to the naked eye look to have pure actions are thoroughly analysed with the sophisticated technology now in place, they are likely to be shown as straightening their arm by 11 and in some cases 12 degrees. Under a strict interpretation of the Law, these players are breaking the rules. The game needs to deal with this reality and make its judgment as to how it accommodates this fact." [183]
In May 2002, Adam Gilchrist , speaking at a Carlton (Australian) Football Club luncheon, claimed Muralitharan's action does not comply with the laws of cricket. The Melbourne-based Age newspaper quoted Gilchrist as saying."Yeah, I think he does (chuck), and I say that because, if you read the laws of the game, there's no doubt in my mind that he and many others, throughout cricket history have." [184] These comments were made before the doosra controversy, in spite of Muralitharan's action having been cleared by ICC in both 1996 and 1999. For his comment Gilchrist was reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and found guilty of being in breach of ACB rules concerned with "detrimental public comment". [185]
During the 2006 tour of New Zealand another Muralitharan critic, former New Zealand captain and cricket commentator Martin Crowe , called for Muralitharan's doosra to be monitored more closely, asserting that his action seemed to deteriorate during a match. [186] Earlier that year when delivering the Cowdrey lecture at Lords Martin Crowe had demanded zero tolerance instead of 15 degrees for throwing and specifically branded Muttiah Muralitharan a chucker. [187] [188] In response to Crowe's criticism ICC general manager Dave Richardson stated that the scientific evidence presented by biomechanists Professor Bruce Elliot, Dr Paul Hurrion and Mr Marc Portuswith was overwhelming and clarified that "Some bowlers, even those not suspected of having flawed actions, were found likely to be straightening their arms by 11 or 12 degrees. And at the same time, some bowlers that may appear to be throwing may be hyper-extending or bowl with permanently bent elbows. Under a strict interpretation of the law, they were breaking the rules – but if we ruled out every bowler that did that then there would be no bowlers left." [189]
Scientific research on bowling actions[ edit ]
Since 1999 there has been a number of scientific research publications discussing Muralitharan's bowling action as well the need for defining the legality of a bowling action using biomechanical concepts. This research directly contributed towards the official acceptance of Muralitharan's bowling action and convinced the ICC to redefine the bowling laws in cricket.
The key publications are listed below:
Elliot, B.C., Alderson, J., Reid, S. and Foster, D. (2004). Bowling Report of Muttiah Muralitharan. [190]
Ferdinands, R.E.D. (2004). Three-dimensional biomechanical analysi building the pressure in the hope that the guy at the other end can benefit from a maiden. Siddle bowled only two in 18 overs as he returned figures of 1 for 80.
However, he was able to watch the fine work of Lee and, particularly, Mitchell Johnson throughout the second and third sessions. Lee recovered from a poor opening and Johnson showed his growing maturity with three wickets and superb control. Any debutant needs to learn quickly but, faced with such a powerful batting order in foreign conditions, Siddle has to be particularly attentive in order to help his new side.

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 2nd day October 18, 2008
Australia fail to answer hard questions

Cameron White: "He's [Matthew Hayden] got a couple of good balls and I'm sure during the series he'll fight back and get lots of runs"

After a couple of tough days in unforgiving conditions against relentless opponents, two of Australia's most inexperienced players were left to explain the worsening situation. Nobody wants to talk when things go badly, but it is unfair to add more pressure to boys in their first weeks as Test players.
At the end of the first, debutant Peter Siddle spoke after picking up Sachin Tendulkar's wicket. It was a bright spot on a torrid opening day for a man who looks like he's most comfortable mucking around with his mates. Good on him.
On display on Saturday was Cameron White, Australia's newest Test legspinner who picked up Sourav Ganguly with a skied catch to mid-off and bowled Harbhajan Singh. Two breakthroughs don't usually earn a post-play appointment to dissect the day and in situations where nobody stands out, or doesn't want to speak about a negative position, the coach Tim Nielsen arrives.
Nielsen's views are of particular interest at the moment. Is it a couple of bad days or something more severe? Is Matthew Hayden the same player of a year ago? Why are the bowlers straying so often? Why are they so unsuccessful against the lower order? And with Troy Cooley in the dressing room, why aren't they getting more reverse-swing?
Both Siddle and White are not yet qualified - or confident enough, or willing to risk the wrath of their new team-mates - to discuss in detail things other than the brilliance of being part of the team. Which is fine. To an Australian cricketer nothing is better than wearing the baggy green for the first time and enjoying the occasion, without having to be grilled about issues they can't expand on.
Australia's bowling on the second day was generally wayward, apart from the superb Mitchell Johnson, and they again let India's lower order escape. When Ishant Sharma was dismissed by Siddle in the fifth over the hosts were 326 for 6, but a flurry of short-pitched balls at Mahendra Singh Dhoni resulted in a burst of match-changing runs. Dhoni and Sourav Ganguly batted well against tactics that were slow to change.
Johnson did not add to his first-day wicket haul, but his 3 for 85 was far better than the returns of Siddle, Lee or White. He is growing with each spell and it was confusing to see him not taking the new ball. His partner Lee, who needed two stitches in his hand following a fielding accident, has taken only three wickets for the series and is struggling for impact in his first series in India.
 
 
It's always hard to start against spin or reverse-swing. Mentally, any batter has to get their head around that. Starting or building an innings will be the hardest partCameron White
 
"The wickets are pretty flat," White said. "Brett hasn't played much cricket over the past little while. With bowling, Brett will definitely improve. Like Matt [Hayden], he's a proven performer so it's probably only a matter of time."
White's bowling is improving, but he knows he is a contributor rather than someone who scares the Indians. Dhoni was the one doing the frightening on Saturday, belting four sixes, including two off White, and almost slicing off the bowler's hand with a powerful straight drive.
"I thought I did an okay job for the team, I guess," White said. "My role is probably a bit different to some of the other spinners. And Ricky [Ponting] probably uses me a bit differently too."
The batting of Hayden is threatening to become a serious concern for Australia. In the country where he started his renaissance eight years ago he is looking unrecognisable. His legs seem heavy, particularly in the early overs when the ball is moving, and he is returning from a long recovery from a heel injury.
Thirteen runs in three innings is an unfamiliar lean spell and over the next couple of weeks Hayden, who will be 37 on October 29, will know whether time is ticking too quickly. "There's nothing wrong with him," White said. "Opening the batting is a very difficult thing to do. He's got a couple of good balls and I'm sure during the series he'll fight back and get lots of runs."
Australia, who are 367 behind, need a big contribution from White on the third day after they slipped to 102 for 4 at stumps. White, the No. 7, will wait until he gets to the crease before forming his plan. "It's always hard to start against spin or reverse-swing," he said. "Mentally, any batter has to get their head around that. Starting or building an innings will be the hardest part."
He said the opening hour on the third day would be crucial. "The first session will dictate the rest of the game," he said. "It's a big first session. The ball is reverse-swinging and spinning, it's going to be very tough."

Career[ edit ]
Duminy is a successful batsman generally occupying the top order, a skilled fielder and a useful change bowler. He became known during the South African under-19s tour to England in 2003 and in the 2003-04 domestic season, where he averaged over 72, two years after breaking into South Africa's Western Province side. Though he bowls less frequently in One Day Internationals , he has also found success with the ball, making his ODI debut in 2004 against Sri Lanka .
Replacing injured vice-captain Ashwell Prince , [1] Duminy made his Test debut against Australia at the WACA in Perth on 17 December 2008, scoring 50 not out in the second innings by hitting the winning runs in the match after putting on an unbroken century partnership with AB de Villiers . His performance was lauded by numerous critics, including Peter Roebuck . [1] In the next Test match, beginning on Boxing Day , Duminy combined with the tailenders to score his maiden Test century of 166. South Africa were more than 200 runs in arrears when they lost their seventh wicket in the first innings. In the process, he and Dale Steyn (76) put on 180 and surpassed Graeme and Peter Pollock 's South African ninth wicket partnership record against Australia. South Africa ended with a 62-run lead and converted it into a nine-wicket win. This sealed the series, the first time that South Africa had won a Test series in Australia, and Australia's first home Test series loss in 16 years.
He also took his first test wicket, Michael Clarke during that tour in the 3rd test, and took one of the freakiest catches ever seen in the 2nd Twenty20 international against Australia in Brisbane. David Hussey skied a ball up in the air and Duminy, while running towards the boundary, flung himself in the air, dived, and took the catch with two hands.
Duminy played in the Indian Premier League in 2009 after the Mumbai Indians franchise acquired him for US$950,000. He scored two half-centuries in the tournament. Currently, he is playing for Delhi Daredevils .
Duminy is sponsored by Gray-Nicolls , an England-based sports-goods company.[ citation needed ]
ICC World Cup 2011[ edit ]
Duminy became the second batsman after Adam Gilchrist to be dismissed for 99 in a World Cup match. Overall, there have been 36 occasions when a player has been dismissed in the nineties in World Cups. [2]
ICC World Cup 2015[ edit ]
Duminy became the first South African to take a hat-trick in a World Cup match. He dismissed Angelo Mathews with the last ball of an over, then dismissed Nuwan Kulasekara and Tharindu Kaushal with the first two balls of the next over. [3] [4]

==Domestic career== Kaul made his debut for the Punjab cricket team against [[Orissa cricket team|Orissa]] in the 2007-08 [[Ranji Trophy]], alongside his brother who was [[wicket-keeper]] for the match. He took a [[five wicket haul]] in the first [[Innings#Cricket|innings]], and finished with [[Bowling analysis|figures]] of 5/97.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/124/124493.html | title=Punjab vrding to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), it was the vote of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) that turned the matter. It was reported in Pakistani newspaper Dawn that the Asian countries promised to hold fundraising events for West Indian cricket during the 2007 Cricket World Cup , which may have influenced the vote. [10] However, I.S. Bindra, chairman of the monitoring committee of the Asian bid, denied that, saying that it was their promise of extra profits of US$400 million that swung the vote in their way. [11]
The ICC was so impressed by the efficiency of the Trans-Tasman bid that they decided to award the next World Cup, to be held in 2015, to them. [12]
Australia and New Zealand last jointly hosted the Cricket World Cup in 1992 .
Format[ edit ]
The tournament featured 14 teams, the same number as the 2011 World Cup, giving associate and affiliate member nations a chance to participate. [13]
The format was the same as the 2011 edition: 14 teams take part in the initial stages, divided into two groups of seven; the seven teams play each other once before the top four teams from each group qualify for the quarter-finals.
On 29 January 2015, ICC reinstated the use of the Super Over for Cricket World Cup Final match if the match finished as a tie. [14] [15]



Host selection[ edit ]
The ICC announced on 30 April 2006 which countries would host the 2011 World Cup. Australia and New Zealand had also bid for the tournament; if successful, they would have shared the hosting equally, leaving the location of the final still to be decided. The Trans–Tasman bid, Beyond Boundaries, was the only one delivered to the ICC headquarters in Dubai before the 1 March deadline, but the Asian bidders were granted an extension by the ICC. [11] The New Zealand government had given assurance that Zimbabwe would be allowed to compete in the tournament, following political discussions in the country over whether their cricket team should be allowed to tour Zimbabwe in 2005 .[ citation needed ]
The extra time needed for the Asian bid had weakened its prospects, but when the time came to vote, Asia won the hosting rights by ten votes to three. [11] The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has revealed that the vote of the West Indies Cricket Board was decisive, as the Asian bid had the support of South Africa and Zimbabwe as well as the four bidding countries. [12] The Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported that the Asian countries had promised to hold fund-raising events for West Indian cricket during the 2007 World Cup , which may have influenced the vote. [13] However, I. S. Bindra, chairman of the Monitoring Committee of the Asian bid, said that their promise of extra profits of around US$400 million had been decisive, [14] that there "was no quid pro quo for their support", [15] and that playing the West Indies had "nothing to do with the World Cup bid". [15]
The ICC prefers to rotate World Cup venues between major cricket playing nations. They have been hosted by England (in 1975, 1979, and 1983), India and Pakistan (1987), Australia and New Zealand (1992), India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka (1996), England and the Netherlands (1999), South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Kenya (2003), and the West Indies (2007). Australia/New Zealand were awarded the 2015 World Cup.
Format[ edit ]
Late in 2007, the four host nations agreed on a revised format for the 2011 World Cup, identical to that of the 1996 World Cup, except that there would be 14 teams instead of 12. The first round of the tournament would consist of two groups of seven teams. Each team in a group would play all the others once, and the top four from each group would qualify for the quarter-finals. [16] This ensured that every team would play at least six matches.
Main articles: ICC World Cricket League 2007–09 and 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier
As per ICC regulations, all 10 full members automatically qualify for the World Cup, including Zimbabwe who have given up their Test playing status until the standard of their team improves. [17]
The ICC also organised a qualifying tournament in South Africa to determine which Associate teams would participate in 2011 event. Ireland, who had been the best performing Associate nation since the last World Cup, won the tournament, beating Canada in the final. The Netherlands and Kenya also qualified by virtue of finishing third and fourth respectively. [18] All 4 associates kept their ODI status.
List of qualified teams[ edit ]
The following 14 teams qualified for the final tournament.
Group A



Australia v New Zealand, final, Melbourne March 29, 2015
New Zealand aggression goes missing
Throughout the tournament, they have captured the imagination of the world with an attacking style of cricket. But against an in-form Australia in the final, they were found wanting for a lack of plan B

Chappell: It went horribly wrong for NZ at the start
Whether setting a five-slip cordon or smashing an 18-ball fifty, Brendon McCullum has flown through this World Cup at breakneck speed. Almost literally, in the case of his reckless diving attempt to prevent a boundary against Bangladesh. The aggressive style has swept the nation up along the way, and raised hopes of beating Australia at their own approach in the final.
That is why Sunday's defeat was a letdown. That New Zealand lost in front of a record cricket crowd of 93,013 at the MCG was maybe not surprising. That they did so by scoring just over four an over, by reducing the cordon to one slip in the fifth over of Australia's chase, when David Warner's edge flew safely to where a second would have been - these were the disappointments.
After ten overs of New Zealand's innings, they had scored 31 for 1, the slowest New Zealand run since Mark Richardson raced Darren Lehmann in a beige bodysuit. It was less than half of the 77 that has been New Zealand's average ten-over score throughout the whole tournament. At one point, they crawled along for 57 balls without a boundary, and they struggled to 66 for 3 after 20 overs.
On the eve of this World Cup final, McCullum was asked about New Zealand's incessant attacking approach. Is there such a thing as too much aggression, someone enquired of him.
"I don't think so," McCullum replied. "For us, we need to play like that, that's how we're going to beat teams on regular occasions. We're not afraid of losing. For us we think about what we can achieve. That's not always going to work and there are going to be times when we come out on the wrong side of it. But that gives us our greatest chance of success against big opposition teams on a regular basis."
You have to wonder, therefore, if New Zealand really gave themselves their greatest chance of lifting the World Cup. To some degree, Australia just didn't let New Zealand play that way. Mitchell Starc's swing up front required serious negotiation. At no stage in this tournament had New Zealand batted first against an in-form attack.
Only twice had they set a target, against an insipid West Indies who served up half-volleys that allowed Martin Guptill to reach a double-century, and in the tournament opener against Sri Lanka, when Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Kulasekara struggled to find their rhythm, and catches were put down that helped New Zealand's cause greatly.
In some ways, New Zealand would have been better off losing the toss. They have chased so well through this campaign and seem to prefer knowing their goal from the outset. McCullum had to bat first when he called correctly, had to back his men to set the game up from the front. It was at once the right call and the wrong result.
When it mattered most, New Zealand were left in the shade © Ryan Pierse/Getty Images
The loss of McCullum himself in the first over of the match was pivotal. In every innings so far in this World Cup, McCullum has scored at better than a run a ball, even if he only stayed out there a couple of overs he got the innings away quickly. Here, Starc's inswing prevented McCullum so much as laying bat on ball from his three deliveries, and he was bowled for a duck.
Without their talisman at least getting a couple of boundaries away, New Zealand seemed lugh being a lower-order batsman, he scored 128 off 312 balls surpassing all the scores of his team mates and maintained a partnership with four batsmen. He was consequently awarded the Man of the match . In the 2008/09 Ranji Trophy final, he became the first bowler to dismiss Sachin Tendulkar , often rated as India's greatest batsman, for a duck in first-class cricket . [5]
Debut[ edit ]
Kumar was included in the playing eleven of the first T20I match against Pakistan at Bengaluru following Parvinder Awana 's poor showing in the previous series against England . He took 3 wickets for 9 runs in 4 overs in the match with an economy rate of 2.25 and thus broke the record for the best bowling figures on T20I debut. He took the wickets of Nasir Jamshed , Ahmed Shehzad and Umar Akmal .
He opened his account in ODIs by taking a wicket in the very first ball that he bowled, dismissing Mohammad Hafeez of Pakistan . Kumar's debut wickets in T20Is, ODIs and Tests have all been bowled and is the first ever bowler to do so.
Test Debut[ edit ]
In his debut Test series, he took 6 wickets in four matches against Australia in the 2013 Border-Gavaskar Trophy . He also had a record partnership with M. S. Dhoni for the 9th wicket in the first Test of the series. He has the highest score by an Indian number 10 on debut, 38.
Kumar made his debut on 22 February 2013 against Australia during 1st test of Australia Tour to India in 2013 . He was given the test cap by Ishant Sharma . He struggled to take any wickets in the first innings, mainly because it was more of a spin track rather than a swing and pace favorable pitch. Later, in the same test during India's batting, he helped set up a massive partnership of 140 runs for the 9th wicket with M. S. Dhoni. This partnership helped India establish a lead of 266 runs. During this course he was part of a few records and was given a standing ovation by the team and the crowd once he got out with a score of 38 runs (off 97 balls). When India went to field in the second innings he didn't get a chance to bowl and went wicketless on his debut. In his second test match he got three wickets getting Australia's David Warner, Ed Cowan and Shane Watson out. In the first innings of his second test against Australia, Kumar went wicketless, mainly because he could not get the ball to swing and was given very few overs (6 in a spell and then a single over). But in the second innings, he took the important wickets of Shane Watson , David Warner and Steven Smith .
Claiming 6 wickets at an average of 22.83 and an economy rate of 3.91.
Champions Trophy and Tri-Series[ edit ]
Kumar was included in the "Team of the tournament" of the 2013 Champions Trophy . [6] On 9 July 2013, he posted career best figures on 4-8 against Sri Lanka in the Tri-Nation tournament , which India would go on to win. He was awarded the "Man of the Series" in this tournament after he finished the series with most wickets. [7]
Tour of England[ edit ]
Kumar proved that he could be handy with the bat in Test matches when he scored 2 consecutive half centuries in the 1st test of the Investec Test Series 2014 against England with scores of 58 and 63*. He also had his 1st five wicket haul in his test career in the first innings of the same match. Kumar had his second five wicket haul in the next match of the same series and got his third fifty in Test in the same match. He became the first Indian number 9 player to get three fifties in one series, even going on to add career-best bowling figures of 6/82 versus England at Lord's. Despite India losing the series 1-3, he was named the Indian Player of the Series. [8]
IPL career[ edit ]
Following his good performances in the 2008/09 Ranji season , he was handed an IPL contract by Royal Challengers Bangalore . [9] In 2011, he was signed by Pune Warriors India . After the dissolution of the PWI team, he was picked up in 2014 by Sunrisers Hyderabad . [10]

Ashish Diwansingh Nehra (
( help · info )
Hindi : आशीष नेहरा; born 29 April 1979) is an Indian cricketer (left-arm fast bowler) who has represented India at the international level since 1999.
Nehra started playing first-class cricket for his hometown, Delhi , in the 1997/1998 season and made his Test debut against Sri Lanka at Colombo in 1999 and his ODI debut against Zimbabwe at Harare in 2001. On his Test debut, Nehra started out well, dismissing Marvan Atapattu early but then failed to pick up any more wickets. Similarly, he dismissed Alistair Campbell with only his 2nd ball in ODIs. He was also part of the Indian team 's run at the 2003 World Cup in South Africa. It was there against England , that he got his career-best ODI figures of six for 23. His performance in the other matches in the World Cup were also noteworthy.
However inconsistency and successive back and ankle injuries have prevented him from cementing his place in the Indian team . His career statistics are better in ODI cricket than in Test cricket , but with 144 ODI wickets at an average of 30.54 his average is higher(lesser the best) than all three of his main competitors for fast bowling places in the Indian team – Irfan Pathan , Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar , who all have bowling averages below 30. The new crop of fast bowlers like Munaf Patel , RP Singh and Ishant Sharma also add to the competition. Nevertheless, Nehra completed recovery from a bowel injury in March 2006 and is trying to make a comeback into the Indian team .
He hit the headlines with creditable showings in the second season of the IPL, and was recalled to the ODI squad for the tour of West Indies in June 2009 after 4 years due to an injury to Zaheer Khan .
In 2011 Cricket World Cup , Nehra played his first game vs South Africa. He was expensive giving away 65 runs during 8.4 wicketless overs. He gave away 16 runs in 4 balls when he had to defend 13 runs in the last over. After this, many thought Nehra's world cup was over. He was, however, a surprise inclusion against Pakistan in the semi-final ahead of Ravichandran Ashwin . Nehra redeemed himself by being the most economical bowler for his side taking 2 wickets in 10 overs for a mere 33 runs as India beat Pakistan by 29 runs. He however could not play the final due to a fractured finger on his right hand. After recovering from his injury, Nehra made himself available for the 2011 ODI series in England; after being ignored, he commented that he was 'deeply hurt'. Despite the backing of former Indian bowler Manoj Prabhakar and a decent Ranji season, he was ignored for the subsequent tour of Australia as well.

A typical cricket field .
Cricket is played on a grassy field . [29] The Laws of Cricket do not specify the size or shape of the field, [30] but it is often oval. In the centre of the field is a rectangular strip, known as the pitch . [29]
The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses. [31] At either end of the pitch, 22 yards (20 m) apart, are placed wooden targets, known as the wickets . These serve as a target for the bowling (also known as the fielding ) side and are defended by the batting side, which seeks to accumulate runs.
Stumps, bails and creases
A wicket consists of three stumps that are hammered into the ground, and topped with two bails .
Each wicket on the pitch consists of three wooden stumps placed vertically, in line with one another. They are surmounted by two wooden crosspieces called bails ; the total height of the wicket including bails is 28.5 inches (720 mm) and the combined width of the three stumps, including small gaps between them is 9 inches (230 mm).
Four lines, known as creases , are painted onto the pitch around the wicket areas to define the batsman's "safe territory" and to determine the limit of the bowler's approach. These are called the "popping" (or batting) crease, the bowling crease and two "return" creases.
The stumps are placed in line on the bowling creases and so these creases must be 22 yards (20 m) apart. A bowling crease is 8 feet 8 inches (2.64 m) long, with the middle stump placed dead centre. The popping crease has the same length, is parallel to the bowling crease and is 4 feet (1.2 m) in front of the wicket. The return creases are perpendicular to the other two; they are adjoined to the ends of the popping crease and are drawn through the ends of the bowling crease to a length of at least 8 feet (2.4 m).
When bowling the ball, the bowler's back foot in his "delivery stride" must land within the two return creases while at least some part of his front foot must land on or behind the popping crease. If the bowler breaks this rule, the umpire calls " No ball ".
The importance of the popping crease to the batsman is that it marks the limit of his safe territory. He can be dismissed stumped or run out (see Dismissals below) if the wicket is broken while he is "out of his ground".
Bat and ball
Two different types of cricket balls :
i) A used white ball. White balls are mainly utilised in limited overs cricket , especially in matches played at night, under floodlights (left).
ii) A used red ball, Red balls are utilised in Test cricket and first-class cricket and some other forms of cricket (right).
NB Both balls are the same size.
The essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers the ball from his end of the pitch towards the batsman who, armed with a bat is "on strike" at the other end.
The bat is made of wood (usually White Willow ) and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than 4.25 inches (108 mm) wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches (970 mm).
The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid , with a circumference of 9 inches (230 mm). The hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 90 miles per hour (140 km/h), is a matter for concern and batsmen wear protective clothing including pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves for the hands, a helmet for the head and a box inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area). Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The ball has a "seam": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent, and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During cricket matches, the quality of the ball changes to a point where it is no longer usable, and during this decline its properties alter and thus influence the match.
Umpires and scorers
Main articles: Umpire (cricket) and Scorer
An umpire
The game on the field is regulated by two umpires , one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called "square leg", a position 15–20 metres to the side of the "on strike" batsman. The main role of the umpires is to adjudicate on whether a ball is correctly bowled (not a no ball or a wide), when a run is scored, and whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase How's That?). Umpires also determine when intervals start and end, decide on the suitability of the playing conditions and can interrupt or even abandon the match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.
Off the field and in televised matches, there is often a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test matches and limited overs internationals played between two ICC full members. These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws of cricket and the spirit of the game.
The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers , one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire. For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws of cricket to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.
Innings
The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for the collective performance of the batting side. [32] In theory, all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they all do so. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has one or two innings apiece.
The main aim of the bowler, supported by his fielders, is to dismiss the batsman. A batsman when dismissed is said to be "out" and that means he must leave the field of play and be replaced by the next batsman on his team. When ten batsmen have been dismissed (i.e., are out), then the whole team is dismissed and the innings is over. The last batsman, the one who has not been dismissed, is not allowed to continue alone as there must always be two batsmen "in". This batsman is termed "not out".
An innings can end early for three reasons: because the batting side's captain has chosen to "declare" the innings closed (which is a tactical decision), or because the batting side has achieved its target and won the game, or because the game has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time. In each of these cases the team's innings ends with two "not out" batsmen, unless the innings is declared closed at the fall of a wicket and the next batsman has not joined in the play.
In limited overs cricket, there might be two batsmen still "not out" when the last of the allotted overs has been bowled.
Overs
Main article: Over (cricket)
The bowler bowls the ball in sets of six deliveries (or "balls") and each set of six balls is called an over . This name came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can bowl unchanged at the same end for several overs. The batsmen do not change ends and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at square leg now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa.
Team structure
A team consists of eleven players. Depending on his or her primary skills, a player may be classified as a specialist batsman or bowler . A well-balanced team usually has five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers. Teams nearly always include a specialist wicket-keeper because of the importance of this fielding position. Each team is headed by a captain who is responsible for making tactical decisions such as determining the batting order, the placement of fielders and the rotation of bowlers.
A player who excels in both batting and bowling is known as an all-rounder . One who excels as a batsman and wicket-keeper is known as a "wicket-keeper/batsman", sometimes regarded as a type of all-rounder. True all-rounders are rare as most players focus on either batting or bowling skills.
Bowling
Main article: Bowling (cricket)
Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan holds the world record for delivering the fastest ball (161.3 km/h). [33]
The bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a "run-up", although some bowlers with a very slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. A fast bowler needs momentum and takes quite a long run-up, running very fast as he does so.
The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 90 miles per hour (140 km/h) and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly. Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile. Some fast bowlers make use of the seam of the ball so that it "curves" or "swings" in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into mistiming his shot so that the ball touches the edge of the bat and can then be "caught behind" by the wicketkeeper or a slip fielder.
At the other end of the bowling scale is the "spinner" who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman. A spinner will often "buy his wicket" by "tossing one up" (in a slower, higher parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot. The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often "flighted" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be "trapped" into getting himself out.
In between the pacemen and the spinners are the "medium pacers" who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration.
All bowlers are classified according to their looks or style. The classifications , as with much cricket terminology, can be very confusing. Hence, a bowler could be classified as LF, meaning he is a left arm fast bowler; or as LBG, meaning he is a right arm spin bowler who bowls deliveries that are called a " leg break " and a " Googly ".
During the bowling action the elbow may be held at any angle and may bend further, but may not straighten out. If the elbow straightens illegally then the square-leg umpire may call no-ball : this is known as "throwing" or "chucking", and can be difficult to detect. The current laws allow a bowler to straighten his arm 15 degrees or less.
Fielding
Fielding positions in cricket for a right-handed batsman
All eleven players on the fielding side take the field together. One of them is the wicket-keeper aka "keeper" who operates behind the wicket being defended by the batsman on strike. Wicket-keeping is normally a specialist occupation and his primary job is to gather deliveries that the batsman does not hit, so that the batsmen cannot run byes. He wears special gloves (he is the only fielder allowed to do so), a box over the groin, and pads to cover his lower legs. Owing to his position directly behind the striker, the wicket-keeper has a good chance of getting a batsman out caught off a fine edge from the bat. He is the only player who can get a batsman out stumped .
Apart from the one currently bowling, the other nine fielders are tactically deployed by the team captain in chosen positions around the field. These positions are not fixed but they are known by specific and sometimes colourful names such as "slip", "third man", "silly mid on" and "long leg". There are always many unprotected areas.
The captain is the most important member of the fielding side as he determines all the tactics including who should bowl (and how); and he is responsible for "setting the field", though usually in consultation with the bowler.
In all forms of cricket, if a fielder gets injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him. The substitute cannot bowl, act as a captain or keep wicket. The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return.
Batting
Main article: batting (cricket)
English cricketer W.G. Grace "taking guard" in 1883. His pads and bat are very similar to those used today. The gloves have evolved somewhat. Many modern players utilise more defensive equipment than was available to Grace, notably helmets and arm guards.
At any one time, there are two batsmen in the playing area. One takes station at the striker's end to defend the wicket as above and to score runs if possible. His partner, the non-striker, is at the end where the bowler is operating.
Batsmen come in to bat in a batting order , decided by the team captain. The first two batsmen – the "openers" – usually face the hostile bowling from fresh fast bowlers with a new ball. The top batting positions are usually given to the most competent batsmen in the team, and the team's bowlers – who are typically, but not always, less skilled as batsmen – typically bat last. The pre-announced batting order is not mandatory; when a wicket falls any player who has not yet batted may be sent in next.
If a batsman "retires" (usually due to injury) and cannot return, he is actually "not out" and his retirement does not count as a dismissal, though in effect he has been dismissed because his innings is over. Substitute batsmen are not allowed.
A skilled batsman can use a wide array of "shots" or "strokes" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an " edge ". Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply "blocking" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run.
An iconic image of Australia's Victor Trumper stepping out to drive
There is a wide variety of shots played in cricket. The batsman's repertoire includes strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., " cut ", "drive", "hook", "pull".
A batsman is not required to play a shot; in the event that he believes the ball will not hit his wicket and there is no opportunity to score runs, he can "leave" the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. He can deliberately use his leg to block the ball and thereby "pad it away" but this is risky because of the leg before wicket rule.
In the event of an injured batsman being fit to bat but not to run, the umpires and the fielding captain were previously able to allow another member of the batting side to be a runner . The runner's only task was to run between the wickets instead of the incapacitated batsman, and he was required to wear and carry exactly the same equipment as the batsman. As of 2011 the ICC outlawed the use of runners as they felt this was being abused. [34]
Runs
Main article: Run (cricket)
The directions in which a right-handed batsman intends to send the ball when playing various cricketing shots. The diagram for a left-handed batsman is a mirror image of this one.
The primary concern of the batsman on strike (i.e., the "striker") is to prevent the ball hitting the wicket and secondarily to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball. To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score.
More than one run can be scored from a single hit; but, while hits worth one to three runs are common, the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more. To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. The batsmen do not need to run if the ball reaches or crosses the boundary.
Brian Lara of the West Indies holds the record for highest score in both Tests and first-class cricket.
Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of "overthrows" by a fielder returning the ball. If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.
The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: "yes", "no" and "wait" are often heard.
Running is a calculated risk because if a fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman is out of his ground (i.e., he does not have part of his body or bat in contact with the ground behind the popping crease), the batsman is run out .
A team's score is reported in terms of the number of runs scored and the number of batsmen that have been dismissed. For example, if five batsmen are out and the team has scored 224 runs, they are said to have scored 224 for the loss of 5 wickets (commonly shortened to "224 for five" and written 224/5 or, in Australia, "five for 224" and 5/224).
Extras
Main article: Extra (cricket)
Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called "sundries" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways:
No ball: a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules of bowling either by (a) using an inappropriate arm action ; (b) overstepping the popping crease; (c) having a foot outside the return crease. In addition, the bowler has to re-bowl the ball. In limited overs matches, a no ball is called if the bowling team's field setting fails to comply with the restrictions. In shorter formats of the game (20–20, ODI) the free hit rule has been introduced. The ball following a front foot no-ball will be a free-hit for the batsman, whereby he is safe from losing his wicket except for being run-out.
Wide: a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach; as with a no ball, a wide must be re-bowled. If a wide ball crosses the boundary, five runs are awarded to the batting side (one run for the wide, and four for the boundary).
Bye: extra(s) awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicketkeeper to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way (note that one mark of a good wicketkeeper is one who restricts the tally of byes to a minimum).
Leg bye: extra(s) awarded if the ball hits the batsman's body, but not his bat, while attempting a legitimate shot, and it goes away from the fielders to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way.
When the bowler has bowled a no ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball. The batsmen have to run (i.e., unless the ball goes to the boundary for four) to claim byes and leg byes but these only count towards the team total, not to the striker's individual total for which runs must be scored off the bat.
Dismissals
Main article: Dismissal (cricket)
There are eleven ways in which a batsman can be dismissed; five relatively common and six extremely rare. The common forms of dismissal are "bowled", "caught", "leg before wicket" (lbw), "run out", and "stumped". Less common methods are "hit wicket", "hit the ball twice", "obstructed the field", "handled the ball" and "timed out" – these are almost unknown in the professional game. The eleventh – retired out – is not treated as an on-field dismissal but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.
If the dismissal is obvious (for example when "bowled" and in most cases of "caught") the batsman will voluntarily leave the field without the umpire needing to dismiss them. Otherwise before the umpire will award a dismissal and declare the batsman to be out, a member of the fielding side (generally the bowler) must "appeal". This is invariably done by asking (or shouting) "how's that?" – normally reduced to howzat? If the umpire agrees with the appeal, he will raise a forefinger and say "Out!". Otherwise he will shake his head and say "Not out". Appeals are particularly loud when the circumstances of the claimed dismissal are unclear, as is always the case with lbw and often with run outs and stumpings.
Bowled : the bowler has hit the wicket with the delivery and the wicket has "broken" with at least one bail being dislodged (note that if the ball hits the wicket without dislodging a bail it is not out). [35]
Caught : the batsman has hit the ball with his bat, or with his hand which was holding the bat, and the ball has been caught before it has touched the ground by a member of the fielding side. [36]
Leg before wicket (lbw): the ball has hit the batsman's body (including his clothing, pads etc. but not the bat, or a hand holding the bat) when it would have gone on to hit the stumps. This rule exists mainly to prevent the batsman from guarding his wicket with his legs instead of the bat. To be given out lbw, the ball must not bounce outside leg stump or strike the batsmen outside the line of leg-stump. It may bounce outside off-stump. The batsman may only be dismissed lbw by a ball striking him outside the line of off-stump if he has not made a genuine attempt to play the ball with his bat. [37]
Run out : a member of the fielding side has broken or "put down" the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman was out of his ground; this usually occurs by means of an accurate throw to the wicket while the batsmen are attempting a run, although a batsman can be given out Run out even when he is not attempting a run; he merely needs to be out of his ground. [38]
Stumped is similar except that it is done by the wicketkeeper after the batsman has missed the bowled ball and has stepped out of his ground, and is not attempting a run. [39]
Hit wicket : a batsman is out hit wicket if he dislodges one or both bails with his bat, person, clothing or equipment in the act of receiving a ball, or in setting off for a run having just received a ball. [40]
Hit the ball twice is very unusual and was introduced as a safety measure to counter dangerous play and protect the fielders. The batsman may legally play the ball a second time only to stop the ball hitting the wicket after he has already played it. "Hit" does not necessarily refer to the batsman's bat. [41]
Obstructing the field : another unusual dismissal which tends to involve a batsman deliberately getting in the way (physically and/or verbally) of a fielder. [42]
Handled the ball : a batsman must not deliberately touch the ball with his hand, for example to protect his wicket. Note that the batsman's hand or glove counts as part of the bat while the hand is holding the bat, so batsmen are frequently caught off their gloves (i.e. the ball hits, and is deflected by, the glove and can then be caught). [43]
Timed out ; means that the next batsman was not ready to receive a delivery within three minutes of the previous one being dismissed. [44]
Retired out : a batsman retires without the umpire's permission, and does not have the permission of the opposition captain to resume their innings. [45]
In the vast majority of cases, it is the striker who is out when a dismissal occurs. If the non-striker is dismissed it is usually by being run out, but he could also be dismissed for obstructing the field, handling the ball or being timed out.
A batsman may leave the field without being dismissed. If injured or taken ill the batsman may temporarily retire, and be replaced by the next batsman. This is recorded as retired hurt or retired ill . The retiring batsman is not out, and may resume the innings later. An unimpaired batsman may retire, and this is treated as being dismissed retired out ; no player is credited with the dismissal. Batsmen cannot be out bowled, caught, leg before wicket, stumped or hit wicket off a no ball. They cannot be out bowled, caught, leg before wicket, or hit the ball twice off a wide. Some of these modes of dismissal can occur without the bowler bowling a delivery. The batsman who is not on strike may be run out by the bowler if he leaves his crease before the bowler bowls, and a batsman can be out obstructing the field or retired out at any time. Timed out is, by its nature, a dismissal without a delivery. With all other modes of dismissal, only one batsman can be dismissed per ball bowled.
Innings closed
Main article: End of an innings (cricket)
An innings is closed when:
Ten of the eleven batsmen are out (have been dismissed); in this case, the team is said to be "all out"
The team has only one batsman left who can bat, one or more of the remaining players being unavailable owing to injury, illness or absence; again, the team is said to be "all out"
The team batting last reaches the score required to win the match
The predetermined number of overs has been bowled (in a one-day match only, commonly 50 overs; or 20 in Twenty20 )
A captain declares his team's innings closed while at least two of his batsmen are not out (this does not apply in one-day limited over matches)
Results
Main article: Result (cricket)
If the team that bats last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, the team is said to have "lost by n runs" (where n is the difference between the number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have "won by n wickets", where n is the number of wickets left to fall. For instance a team that passes its opponents' score having only lost six wickets would have won "by four wickets".
In a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have won by an innings and n runs, and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores.
If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie ; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side. In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw .
If the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of deliveries for each innings is often imposed. Such a match is called a "limited overs" or "one-day" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth-Lewis method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a "no-result" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.
Distinctive elements
Individual focus
For a team sport, cricket places individual players under unusual scrutiny and pressure. Bowler, batsman, and fielder all act essentially independently of each other. While team managements can signal bowler or batsman to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is slightly mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for a long time.
Spirit of the Game
Cricket is a unique game where in addition to the laws, the players must abide by the "Spirit of the Game". [46] The standard of sportsmanship has historically been considered so high that the phrase "it's just not cricket" was coined in the 19th century to describe unfair or underhanded behaviour in any walk of life. In the last few decades though, cricket has become increasingly fast-paced and competitive, increasing the use of appealing and sledging , although players are still expected to abide by the umpires' rulings without argument, and for the most part they do. Beginning in 2001, the MCC has held an annual lecture named after Colin Cowdrey on the spirit of the game. [47] Even in the modern game fielders are known to signal to the umpire that a boundary was hit, despite what could have been considered a spectacular save (though they might be found out by the TV replays anyway). In addition to this, some batsmen have been known to "walk" when they think they are out even if the umpire does not declare them out. This is a high level of sportsmanship, as a batsman can easily take advantage of incorrect umpiring decisions.
Influence of weather
Floodlights at M. A. Chidambaram Stadium , Chennai
Cricket is a sport played predominantly in the drier periods of the year. But, even so, the weather is a major factor in all cricket matches.
A scheduled game of cricket cannot be played in wet weather. Dampness affects the bounce of the ball on the wicket and is a risk to all players involved in the game. Many grounds have facilities to cover the cricket pitch (or the wicket). Covers can be in the form of tarpaulins being laid over the wicket to elevated covers on wheels (using the same concept as an umbrella) to even hover covers which form an airtight seal around the wicket. However, most grounds do not have the facilities to cover the outfield. This means that in the event of heavy bouts of bad weather, games may be cancelled, abandoned or suspended due to an unsafe outfield.
Another factor in cricket is the amount of light available. At grounds without floodlights (or in game formats which disallow the use of floodlights), umpires can stop play in the event of bad light as it becomes too difficult for the batsmen to be able to see the ball coming at them, (and in extreme cases, members of the fielding team).
On the other hand, in instances of good light, batsmen can utilise sight-screens which enable batsmen to have a white background against which they can pick out the red ball (or black background for white ball) with greater ease.
The umpires always have the final decision on weather-related issues.
Uniqueness of each field
Unlike those of most sports, cricket playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the pitch and infield are specifically regulated, the Laws of Cricket do not specify the size or shape of the field. [30] The field boundaries are sometimes painted and sometimes marked by a rope. Pitch and outfield variations can have a significant effect on how balls behave and are fielded as well as on batting. Pitches vary in consistency, and thus in the amount of bounce, spin, and seam movement available to the bowler. Hard pitches are usually good to bat on because of high but even bounce. Dry pitches tend to deteriorate for batting as cracks often appear, and when this happens to the pitch, spinners can play a major role. Damp pitches, or pitches covered in grass (termed "green" pitches), allow good fast bowlers to extract extra bounce. Such pitches tend to offer help to fast bowlers throughout the match, but become better for batting as the game goes on. While players of other outdoor sports deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardised. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ground. A given ground may acquire a reputation as batsman friendly or bowler friendly if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The absence of a standardised field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team makeup and players' statistical records.

The team was removed from the Indian Premier League after the consortium failed to pay the yearly union dues to BCCI.
Termination from IPL[ edit ]
On 19 September 2011, BCCI president N Srinivasan announced that the Kochi Tuskers Kerala IPL franchise was terminated by the BCCI because they failed to provide a bank guarantee to cover their annual fee. [16]
The franchise's plea seeking to restrain the BCCI from encashing its bank guarantee of ₹1.56 billion was rejected by a single bench of Justice SF Vajifdar. [16]
On 14 October 2011, the IPL Governing Council announced that there would be only nine teams participating in 2012 after the Kochi franchise was expelled from the league. [17] The players from the Kochi Tuskers were auctioned to other franchises in 2012 IPL player auction. Players who attracted no bids had their salaries covered via the team's bank guarantee from the previous season. [18]
On 13 January 2012, the BCCI asked the foreign individual players who had signed contract with Kochi Tuskers to sue Kochi Tuskers' owners, with the BCCI included as party to each case. [19]
There is a court case given by Rendezvous Sports World Pvt Ltd, one of the co-owners of the terminated Kochi Tuskers Kerala IPL franchise a late bid to revive the team.
Sponsorships[ edit ]
Federal Bank , a major Indian commercial bank in the private sector, with headquarters in Aluva , Kerala, was be the principal sponsor of Kochi Tuskers Kerala. [20] The tickets for KTK's home matches were sold through Federal bank branches and their website.The Ticket sales of Kochi Tuskers Kerala was officially started in a ceremony hosted at the Le Meridian Hotel Kochi, on 28 March. Soon after, the tickets become available at the teams official ticketing partner website kyazoonga.com. [21]
Lotto , an Italian sports goods manufacturer was the apparel sponsor for the team. [22]
V-Guard , an electronics company and AVT, a tea brand were the associate sponsors. Elite Foods , Parinee Developers and Anchor Earth are the other main sponsors.
Grounds[ edit ]
The two home grounds of the Kochi Tuskers Kerala were the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi and Holkar Cricket Stadium , Indore . Five homes matches were held at Kochi and two at Indore . The Greater Cochin Development Authority completely over-hauled the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium to cater for hosting IPL matches. [23]
Main article: 2011 IPL Players Auction
KTK bought 17 players in the IPL 2011 auction, signing five specialist batsmen, those being Mahela Jayawardene , VVS Laxman , Brad Hodge , Owais Shah and Michael Klinger . The team signed six bowlers, the most notable being Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan . The others include Sreesanth , RP Singh , Ramesh Powar , Vinay Kumar and Steve O'Keefe . Four all-rounders were signed those being Ravindra Jadeja , Steve Smith , Thisara Perera and John Hastings . Two renowned Wicket-keeper batsmen were signed, Brendon McCullum who is the leading run scorer in Twenty20 Internationals and Parthiv Patel . But KTK lost both the Australians all-rounders Steve Smith and John Hastings for the 2011 season due to injuries, without either of them playing a game for KTK. [24]
The Sri Lankan players playing in IPL were asked to return by 5 May for a camp for upcoming England tour by the Sri Lankan Cricket Board . [25] KTK's captain Mahela Jayawardene and Thisara Perera were supposed to leave the team early, but BCCI and the Sri Lankan board came to an agreement and the players will now have to return only by 18 May. [26] Mahela's possible departure fuelled off many speculations that Sourav Ganguly may join the team as then KTK can request the IPL Governing Council for a replacement of him as per the rule of same base price. [27] Ganguly ultimately joined the other debut team of IPL 4, Pune Warriors India in place of the injured fast bowler, Ashish Nehra .
On 18 May 2011, Parthiv Patel lead the tuskers against Chennai Super Kings in their last group match of IPL 2011 season as skipper Mahela Jayawardene had to leave for national duty. [28]



Franchise history[ edit ]
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced in September 2007 the establishment of the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008. [15] In January 2008, the BCCI unveiled the owners of eight city-based franchises. The team is one of the eight founding members of the IPL in 2008. The Jaipur franchise was sold to the Emerging Media for $67 million, making it the least expensive team in the league. [1]
The franchise is currently owned and chaired by Manoj Badale . Other investors include Ryan Tkalcevic , Lachlan Murdoch , Aditya S Chellaram, and Suresh Chellaram. The Group acquired the franchise for $67million. [16] Incidentally, this was the least expensive franchise in the Indian Premier League and probably the least fancied team in the league at the beginning of the tournament. [17] It made a pre-tax profit of $7.5 million in 2009. [18]
Expulsion from the IPL & return[ edit ]
In 2010, the BCCI decided to expel Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals from the IPL. The expulsion baffled captain Shane Warne who stated that he suspected that there might be some foul play and that the BCCI might possess some ulterior motives. [19] The Rajasthan Royals however filed an appeal against the decision and the two parties went to the Mumbai High Court to decide [20] The Mumbai high-court adjourned that case until 29 October 2010. [21] Both parties then agreed to adjourn the case again to 15 November because they didn't want it to coincide with Diwali celebrations from 1 to 14 November [22] Later it was announced by the Royals that they told the Bombay High Court that they would be negotiating with an arbitrator to see if they could reconcile with the IPL [23] The arbitrator announced that while the investigation was ongoing the Royals would remain apart of the IPL for six-weeks and the BCCI would not be allowed to change rules which might go against the Royals. The six-week period included the player auction in which Rajasthan Royals participated. [24] After this the Bombay High Court rejected the appeals of the BCCI against keeping the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL for six-weeks while the case was sorted out. [25] It was estimated because of the losses in court cases and damaging reputation the BCCI decided not to pursue any further legal action against Royals' or Kings XI Punjab and announced they decided to keep them in the IPL. [26]
Team history[ edit ]
2008 IPL season[ edit ]
Prior to the start of the inaugural IPL season , many considered the Royals as possibly the weakest team in the IPL, giving them little chance of competing well in the tournament. [27] Evidence of the latter opinion seemed to be confirmed when the team lost its first match against the Delhi Daredevils in a 9 wicket loss. [28] The fears were confirmed that the team was likely to struggle, but who would have ever though that this was the beginning of a new dawn for the team? But this team believed in writing their own script and there was something about their style of cricket, perhaps the simple attitude with which they approached the game. This simplicity was bought about largely by Warne’s captaincy, as he never had the fear to lose and was always calm in dealing with his players and pressure situations. [29] In their first home game ever at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, they played against the Kings XI Punjab and won by 6 wickets as Shane Watson was declared the man of the match for his unbeaten 76 off 49 balls in what was a successful run chase. That was followed by a crucial 3 wicket win against one of the favourites to win the competition, Deccan Chargers in Hyderabad. The victory proved to be a huge morale booster for the side since this was their first away win and second successful run chase on the trot, as Yusuf Pathan made a name for himself with his first man of the match award for his bowling figures of 2/20 in 4 overs and a 28-ball 61. Watson almost replicated Yusuf’s all-round performance in the following match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bangalore as another run chase was completed. In the 7 wicket victory, ‘Watto’ picked 2/20 in 4 overs and smashed 61 not out off 41 balls. Their next game was another crucial one, against the Kolkata Knight Riders at home and Rajasthan won convincingly by 45 runs as the diminutive opener from Goa, Swapnil Asnodkar received his first man of the match award for a fine knock of 60 off just 34 balls. They also managed to defeat the Chennai Super Kings in Jaipur, as Pakistan’s Sohail Tanvir continued to show his red hot bowling form in the game, picking 6 wickets for 14 runs in 4 overs, winning the man of the match award for the same. But a minor hiccup followed, as they were thrashed by 7 wickets by the unpredictable Mumbai Indians in Navi Mumbai. However the Royals won their next game by defeating the Kings XI Punjab and continued to win the next five games in a row. The Royals built up an impressive 11–3 record after their fourteen preliminary round matches; this included a consecutive 5-game and 6-game winning streak with an undefeated record on their home ground and a spot at the top of the points table. They were also the first team to book a place in the semifinals with their 65 run win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore . Deccan Chargers were denied their first victory against the Rajasthan Royals, once again due to the burly Yusuf Pathan, who won his second man of the match award for his 37-ball 68 as Rajasthan prevailed by 8 wickets at home. There were two more home games on the trot, as the Delhi Daredevils were beaten this time by 3 wickets with Watto again performing his all-round magic to bewilder the opposition, as he ended with 2/21 in 4 overs and hit a 40-ball 74 to guide the chase adequately enough in the end. Whereas, the Royal Challengers Bangalore were thrashed by 65 runs, as South Africa’s captain Graeme Smith won the man of the match award for his unbeaten 49-ball 75. Their next challenge was to conquer the nerves which can be developed when playing at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. But the home team was given a proper thumping by Yusuf Pathan who hammered an unbeaten 48 off just 18 balls, and backed it with bowling figures of 1/14 in 2 overs as Rajasthan Royals won by 6 wickets. They were however, given a tough fight by the Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in their 10-run victory. Followed by which, their last home game of the season was against the Mumbai Indians and Warne’s boys ensured that they remained at the top of the points table in the conclusion of the round robin stage, with a 5-wicket win as Tanvir once again was devastating, picking 4/14 in his 4 overs. They did lose to the Kings XI Punjab in the final round robin game, but easily made it to the semifinals and Sohail Tanvir won the first ever Purple Cap in IPL history, for taking the most number of wickets in the tournament. Shane Warne's captaincy and simultaneous coaching was praised and well received by everyone, [30] [31] including opposition teams. [32] In addition, many players of the Royals team had consistently played well.Their semifinal was against the Delhi Daredevils in Mumbai, which was expected to be a tough contest for them. Yet, Delhi were walloped by 105 runs as Watto made this a one-sided contest following his 29-ball 52 and 3/10 in 3 overs, hence continuing his purple patch in the competition and assuring a place for Rajasthan in the final against MS Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings in the same city. The final was a cliffhanger, which was ideal to end the first ever IPL tournament. Chennai could play their best possible to attempt stopping an in-form Rajasthan Royals. Although their team total after 20 overs was around 150, they took the match till the final ball until appropriately. With the scores level with one ball remaining, it was their bowling hero Sohail Tanvir who hit the winning runs to ensure that Rajasthan were crowned the champions of the first season of the IPL, making history in the process. Yusuf Pathan was declared the man of the match in the final as well, for his figures of 3/22 in 4 overs and 56 runs and thus became a household name ever since, beating the popularity of his younger brother Irfan Pathan and going on to represent India in the shorter formats of the game. [33] The all-rounder Shane Watson won the man of the tournament award for scoring as many as 472 runs and picking 17 wickets. This was able to make him cement his spot in all formats of the game in the Australian team, and has now become one of the most valuable T20 players in world cricket. It was an incredible victory for an underdog team which had inexperienced, young Indian cricketers mostly who could mainly speak in their mother tongues, which Warne could not understand. Yet, he was able to unite them speaking only one language, CRICKET. This is why he is considered a legend till date irrespective of his off-field antics and his leadership is one of the success stories of the tournament and corporate do use him as an example to determine the cultural quotient of their firms. Rajasthan Royals qualified for the Champions League T20 that year, but the event was cancelled on the account of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November 2008.The Rajasthan Royals became the winner of the first IPL tournament, when they defeated the Chennai Super Kings by 3 wickets in the final played on 1 June 2008. With the scores level with one ball remaining, Sohail Tanvir scored the winning run and therefore prevented the match from being decided on a bowl out. [33] Each player and representative on the team was awarded a medal and the team was presented with the DLF Indian Premier League trophy along with a cheque for US$1.2 million prize money. Many of the Royals' players also took home individual awards for their performance during the tournament; Yusuf Pathan claimed the Man of the Match award for the final match, Sohail Tanvir finished the tournament in possession of the Purple Cap (the IPL's leading wicket taker) and Australian all-rounder Shane Watson was declared the Man of the Series.
2009 IPL season[ edit ]
The Royals came into the tournament in South Africa as the defending champions, but not one of the favourites since Sohail Tanvir was ineligible to play for the team due to the ban imposed by the BCCI on Pakistani players playing in the competition. As well as the fact that Shane Watson, their star player last time around was unavailable for the whole season as Australia featured in an ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE. Without these two, the team looked slightly weaker than the previous season and players such as the countryman Graeme Smith, fiery pacer Shaun Tait and the aging ‘Fuhrer’ Shane Warne had to be relied on. [34]
Rajasthan began their 2009 campaign against the Royal Challengers Bangalore solemnly. They were bowled out for the lowest ever total in the history of the IPL, a paltry 58 as they were thrashed by 75 runs in Newlands, Cape Town by the Kevin Pietersen-led side. They made a short trip to Durban to play the Mumbai Indians but that match was washed out due to rain, which made Rajasthan go at the bottom of the points table at that stage.
But on their return to Cape Town, they faced the Kolkata Knight Riders in a match which went to the Super Over, and Rajasthan were only able to win due to Yusuf Pathan’s onslaught off the bowling of Ajantha Mendis, knocking off the required 17 runs in just 4 balls. At the same ground although, they were defeated by the Kings XI Punjab by 27 runs.
Yusuf again played a blinder of an innings, an unbeaten 30-ball 62 to help Rajasthan Royals beat Delhi Daredevils yet again, by 5 wickets. But the team that they met in the final last season, Chennai Super Kings was too good for them in their first clash of the season in Pretoria where Chennai won by 38 runs.
However, Yusuf was at his all-round best as the Royals beat the Deccan Chargers by 3 wickets as he bowled well in his 4 overs, with figures of 1/19 and contributing 24 runs off 17 balls. They also were able to hammer Kings XI Punjab by 78 runs in their return match in Durban as Graeme Smith made the decibel levels on the ground increase with his 44-ball 77. Whereas, they took their revenge against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, prevailing by 7 wickets as the team rode on the unknown Indian pacer, Amit Singh’s spell of 4/19 in 4 overs. Then disaster struck. They lost yet another contest to the Chennai Super Kings, by 7 wickets and Deccan Chargers posted their first win against the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, by a massive margin of 53 runs. The Royals managed to shut out the Mumbai Indians by a mere 2 runs due to Warne’s brilliance but were knocked out of the tournament with back-to-back defeats to the Delhi Daredevils by 14 runs and the bottom-ranked Kolkata Knight Riders by 3 wickets.
Seven players were dropped from the team and they were sent back to home. These players were - Mohammed Kaif, Dinesh Salunkhe, Paras Dogra, Anup Revandkar, Srideep Mangela, Ashraf Makda and Azhar Malik. [35]
Rajasthan Royals ended 6th out of the 8 teams in the competition, winning 6 matches out of the 14 they played. The Royals failed to make it to the semifinals after losing their last two matches against Delhi Daredevils and Kolkata Knight Riders. It was a disappointing finish for Warne’s boys, who had won many hearts with their 2008 performance. [36]
British Asian Cup[ edit ]
On 14 May 2009 it was announced that Rajasthan Royals would meet Middlesex Crusaders in a one-off Twenty20 for the British Asian Cup. It was the first time that an annual charity series to be played between the Twenty20 champions of the two countries. The match took place on 6 July 2009. The Squads were announced on 3 July 2009 with Rajasthan Royals included Mohammad Kaif and also saw a comeback of Sohail Tanvir . The match was won by Rajasthan Royals by 46 runs after scoring 162/5 in 20 overs and successfully defending it by 46 runs (Middlesex 116/7). The MoM was Dimitri Mascarenhas . [37]
2010 IPL season[ edit ]
The Royals were back in India after their average outing in South Africa. This time they seemed to be a better outfit as they were to play in conditions which should have suited them the most. But they had to suffer an unfortunate start to the competition, with a narrow 4 run defeat to the Mumbai Indians at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai. The highlight of this match though, was Yusuf Pathan hitting the fastest ever hundred in IPL history, off only 37 balls! Even some of the Mumbai fans were disappointed not to see Rajasthan win, by the end of it all. [29]
They went on to lose to the Delhi Daredevils by 6 wickets on one of their new ‘home’ grounds, Ahmedabad. And were again bruised badly by the Royal Challengers Bangalore, who won by 10 wickets. The team remained inconsistent throughout the whole season, winning their next four matches consecutively. One of the young Turks of the erstwhile ICL, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala impressed against the franchise representing his home state, Kolkata Knight Riders as his 36-ball 45 helped the Royals win by 34 runs.
Followed by which the Western Australian batsman Adam Voges hit 45 runs off 24 balls to help Rajasthan beat Punjab in Mohali by 31 runs. The team seemed to have adapted to the Ahmedabad conditions better with wins against Deccan Chargers by 8 wickets as Yusuf Pathan continued his good form against the team, while they beat Chennai Super Kings by 17 runs courtesy wicket-keeper batsman Naman Ojha’s 49-ball 80. But they lost against Chennai in their return clash as Murali Vijay’s hundred took the game away from them as well as were crushed in Delhi by 67 runs. But they managed to escape a Deccan Chargers attack, with a narrow 2 run victory in Nagpur and continued their unbeaten run in Jaipur though, as the out of sorts Kings XI Punjab were duly beaten by 9 wickets with English opener Michael Lumb winning the man of the match award for his 43-ball 83.
Once again, Rajasthan Royals ended the tournament miserably with losses to Mumbai Indians and the Royal Challengers Bangalore at home, and the Kolkata Knight Riders in the last round robin game in Kolkata. Consequently, they failed to make it to the playoffs for the second consecutive season as they finished 7th out of the 8 teams in the competition, winning 6 games out of 14 played. [29]
2011 IPL season[ edit ]
The Rajasthan Royals, and the Kings XI Punjab were temporarily ejected from the league due to issues with their unreported ownership changes. The teams were reinstated with involvement from the High Court. [38] Their owners were broken into several legal entities when the BCCI required the incorporation of the companies. [39] [40] Kochi was also at risk of ejection for the same reasons before BCCI cleared their new ownership pattern for the tournament. [41]
The team management decided to retain the Australian duo of Shane- Swann had said he preferred a harder ball on this surface as well - and the hosts' Man-of-the-Series Stuart Broad, who was the pick of England's quicks on the final day, made swift inroads. MS Dhoni flashed an edge to second slip and three balls later RP Singh edged behind. The only question now was whether India would at least make England bat again.
Even that proved too much as Swann wrapped up the innings against batsmen who had decided to have a swing. Sreesanth was the last to fall, heaving an inside edge on to the stumps to send England into another round of celebrations. It was a familiar scene in this series, a run of performances that will go down in the game's history as one of the most dominant displays. England have set a benchmark for this generation of Test cricket and now others need to follow suit.

Vikas Tokas (born 16 October 1986) is an Indian cricketer who plays for Delhi cricket team in domestic cricket. He is a right-arm medium-fast bowler who bowls at a speed of over 135kmph. After making his debut for Railways cricket team in 2010, Tokas switched to Delhi in 2012. [1]



The name "Bangalore" represents an anglicised version of the Kannada language name, "Bengalūru" ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು [ˈbeŋɡəɭuːru]
 (
listen )
. The earliest reference to the name "Bengalūru" was found in a ninth-century Western Ganga Dynasty stone inscription on a "vīra gallu" (ವೀರಗಲ್ಲು) (literally, " hero stone ", a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior). In this inscription found in Begur , "Bengalūrū" is referred to as a place in which a battle was fought in 890 CE . It states that the place was part of the Ganga Kingdom until 1004 and was known as "Bengaval-uru", the "City of Guards" in Halegannada (Old Kannada). [17] [18]
An apocryphal or a fabricated story recounts that the 12th century Hoysala king Veera Ballala II , while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans. The grateful king named the place "benda-kaal-uru" (literally, "town of boiled beans"), which eventually evolved into "Bengalūru". [17] [19] [20] Suryanath Kamath has put forward an explanation of a possible floral origin of the name, being derived from benga, the Kannada term for Pterocarpus marsupium (also known as the Indian Kino Tree ), a species of dry and moist deciduous trees , that grew abundantly in the region. [21]
On 11 December 2005, the Government of Karnataka announced that it had accepted a proposal by Jnanpith Award winner U. R. Ananthamurthy to rename Bangalore to Bengalūru. [22] On 27 September 2006, the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) passed a resolution to implement the proposed name change. [23] The government of Karnataka accepted the proposal, and it was decided to officially implement the name change from 1 November 2006. [24] [25] The Union government have approved (along with other 12 cities) this request in October 2014 and Bangalore was renamed to "Bengaluru" on November 1, 2014. [26] [27]

A discovery of Stone Age artifacts during the 2001 census of India at Jalahalli , Sidhapura and Jadigenahalli, all of which are located on Bangalore's outskirts today, suggest probable human settlement around 4,000 BCE. [28] Around 1,000 BCE ( Iron Age ), burial grounds were established at Koramangala and Chikkajala on the outskirts of Bangalore. Coins of the Roman emperors Augustus , Tiberius , and Claudius found at Yeswanthpur and HAL indicate that Bangalore was involved in trans-oceanic trade with ancient civilisations in 27 BCE. [29]
The region of modern-day Bangalore was part of several successive South Indian kingdoms. Between the fourth and the tenth centuries, the Bangalore region was ruled by the Western Ganga Dynasty of Karnataka, the first dynasty to set up effective control over the region. [30] According to Edgar Thurston [31] there were twenty eight kings who ruled Gangavadi from the start of the Christian era till its conquest by the Cholas. These kings belonged to two distinct dynasties: the earlier line of the Solar race which had a succession of seven kings of the Ratti or Reddi tribe, and the later line of the Ganga race. The Western Gangas ruled the region initially as a sovereign power (350 – 550), and later as feudatories of the Chalukyas of Badami , followed by the Rashtrakutas till the tenth century. [21] The Begur Nageshwara Temple was commissioned around 860, during the reign of the Western Ganga King Ereganga Nitimarga I and extended by his successor Nitimarga II. [32] [33] Around 1004, during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I , the Cholas defeated the Western Gangas under the command of the crown prince Rajendra Chola I , and captured Bangalore. [32] [34] During this period, the Bangalore region witnessed the migration of many groups — warriors, administrators, traders, artisans, pastorals, cultivators, and religious personnel from Tamil Nadu and other Kannada speaking regions. [30] The Chokkanathaswamy temple at Domlur , the Aigandapura complex near Hesaraghatta , Mukthi Natheshwara Temple at Binnamangala, Choleshwara Temple at Begur , Someshwara Temple at Madiwala , date from the Chola era. [32]
In 1117, the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas in the Battle of Talakad in south Karnataka, and extended its rule over the region. [32] Vishnuvardhana expelled the Cholas from all parts of Mysore state. [35] By the end of the 13th century, Bangalore became a source of contention between two warring cousins, the Hoysala ruler Veera Ballala III of Halebidu and Ramanatha, who administered from the Hoysala held territory in Tamil Nadu. [32] Veera Ballala III had appointed a civic head at Hudi (now within Bangalore Municipal Corporation limits), thus promoting the village to the status of a town. After Veera Ballala III's death in 1343, the next empire to rule the region was the Vijayanagara Empire , which itself saw the rise of four dynasties, the Sangamas (1336 – 1485), the Saluvas (1485 – 1491), the Tuluvas (1491 – 1565), and the Aravidu (1565 – 1646). [36] During the reign of the Vijayanagara Empire, Achyuta Deva Raya of the Tuluva Dynasty raised the Shivasamudra Dam across the Arkavati river at Hesaraghatta , whose reservoir is the present city's supply of regular piped water. [37]
Foundation and early modern history
Bangalore Fort in 1860 showing fortifications and barracks. The fort was originally built by Kempe Gowda I as a mud fort in 1537.
Bangalore Palace , built in 1887 in Tudor architectural style was modelled on the Windsor Castle in England. [38]
Modern Bangalore had its beginning in 1537 by a vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempé Gowda I , who aligned with the Vijayanagara empire to campaign against Gangaraja who he defeated and expelled to Kanchi, and who built a mud-brick fort for the people at the site that would become the central part of modern Bangalore. Kempe Gowda was restricted by rules placed by Achuta Deva Raya who feared the potential power of KempeGowda and did not allow for a formidalbe stone fort. Kempé Gowda referred to the new town as his "gandubhūmi" or "Land of Heroes". [20] Within the fort, the town was divided into smaller divisions—each called a "pete" (
IPA: 
[peːteː] ). The town had two main streets—Chikkapeté Street, which ran east-west, and Doddapeté Street, which ran north-south. Their intersection formed the Doddapeté Square—the heart of Bangalore. Kempé Gowda I's successor, Kempé Gowda II, built four towers that marked Bangalore's boundary. During the Vijayanagara rule, many saints and poets referred to Bangalore as "Devarāyanagara" and "Kalyānapura" or "Kalyānapuri" ("Auspicious City"). [39]
After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 in the Battle of Talikota , Bangalore's rule changed hands several times. Kempé Gowda declared independence, then in 1638, a large Adil Shahi Bijapur army led by Ranadulla Khan and accompanied by his second in command Shāhji Bhōnslé defeated Kempé Gowda III, [39] and Bangalore was given to Shāhji as a jagir (feudal estate). In 1687, the Mughal general Kasim Khan, under orders from Aurangzeb , defeated Ekoji I , son of Shāhji, and sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704), the then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore for three lakh rupees. [40] After the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II in 1759, Hyder Ali , Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore Army, proclaimed himself the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. Hyder Ali is credited with building the Delhi and Mysore gates at the northern and southern ends of the city in 1760. [41] The kingdom later passed to Hyder Ali's son Tipu Sultan . Hyder and Tipu contributed towards the beautification of the city by building Lal Bagh Botanical Gardens in 1760. Under them, Bangalore developed into a commercial and military centre of strategic importance. [39]
The Bangalore fort was captured by the British armies under Lord Cornwallis on 21 March 1791 during the Third Anglo-Mysore War and formed a centre for British resistance against Tipu Sultan. [42] Following Tipu's death in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), the British returned administrative control of the Bangalore "pētē" to the Maharaja of Mysore and was incorporated into the Princely State of Mysore , which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj . The old city ("pētē") developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore. The Residency of Mysore State was first established in Mysore City in 1799 and later shifted to Bangalore in 1804. It was abolished in 1843 only to be revived in 1881 at Bangalore and to be closed down permanently in 1947, with Indian independence . [43] The British found Bangalore to be a pleasant and appropriate place to station their garrison and therefore moved their cantonment to Bangalore from Seringapatam in 1809 near Halsur, about 6 kilometres (4 mi) north-east of the City. A town grew up around the cantonment, by absorbing several villages in the area. The new centre had its own municipal and administrative apparatus, though technically it was a British enclave within the territory of the Wodeyar Kings of the Princely State of Mysore. [44] Two important developments which contributed to the rapid growth of the city, include the introduction of telegraph connections to all major Indian cities in 1853 and a rail connection to Madras , in 1864. [45]

The Bangalore torpedo was invented in Bangalore in 1922.
In the 19th century, Bangalore essentially became a twin city , with the "pētē", whose residents were predominantly Kannadigas and the cantonment created by the British. [46] Throughout the 19th century, the Cantonment gradually expanded and acquired a distinct cultural and political salience as it was governed directly by the British and was known as the Civil and Military Station of Bangalore. While it remained in the princely territory of Mysore, Cantonment had a large military presence and a cosmopolitan civilian population that came from outside the princely state of Mysore, including British and Anglo-Indians army officers.[ citation needed ]
Bangalore was hit by a plague epidemic in 1898 that claimed nearly 3,500 lives. The crisis caused by the outbreak catalysed the city's sanitation process. Telephone lines were laid to help coordinate anti-plague operations. Regulations for building new houses with proper sanitation facilities came into effect. A health officer was appointed and the city divided into four wards for better coordination. Victoria Hospital was inaugurated in 1900 by Lord Curzon , the then Governor-General of British India . [47] New extensions in Malleswaram and Basavanagudi were developed in the north and south of the pētē. [48] In 1903, motor vehicles came to be introduced in Bangalore. [49] In 1906, Bangalore became one of the first cities in India to have electricity from hydro power , powered by the hydroelectric plant situated in Shivanasamudra . [50] The Indian Institute of Science was established in 1909, which subsequently played a major role in developing the city as a science research hub. [51] In 1912, the Bangalore torpedo , a defensive explosive weapon widely used in World War I and World War II , was devised in Bangalore by British army officer Captain McClintock of the Madras Sappers and Miners . [52]
Bangalore's reputation as the "Garden City of India" began in 1927 with the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the rule of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV . Several projects such as the construction of parks, public buildings and hospitals were instituted to improve the city. [53] Bangalore played an important role during the Indian independence movement . Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1927 and 1934 and addressed public meetings here. [29] In 1926, the labour unrest in Binny Mills due to demand by textile workers for payment of bonus resulted in lathi charging and police firing, resulting in the death of four workers, and several injuries. [54] In July 1928, there were notable communal disturbances in Bangalore, when a Ganesh idol was removed from a school compound in the Sultanpet area of Bangalore. [55] In 1940, the first flight between Bangalore and Bombay took off, which placed the city on India's urban map. [51]
After India's independence in August 1947, Bangalore remained in the newly carved Mysore State of which the Maharaja of Mysore was the Rajapramukh (appointed governor). [56] The "City Improvement Trust" was formed in 1945, and in 1949, the "City" and the "Cantonment" merged to form the Bangalore City Corporation . The Government of Karnataka later constituted the Bangalore Development Authority in 1976 to co-ordinate the activities of these two bodies. [57] Public sector employment and education provided opportunities for Kannadigas from the rest of the state to migrate to the city. Bangalore experienced rapid growth in the decades 1941–51 and 1971–81, which saw the arrival of many immigrants from northern Karnataka. By 1961, Bangalore had become the sixth largest city in India, with a population of 1,207,000. [39] In the decades that followed, Bangalore's manufacturing base continued to expand with the establishment of private companies such as MICO (Motor Industries Company), which set up its manufacturing plant in the city.
By the 1980s, it was clear that urbanization had spilled over the current boundaries, and in 1986, the Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority , was established to co-ordinate the development of the entire region as a single unit. [57] On 8 February 1981, a major fire broke out at Venus Circus in Bangalore, where more than 92 lives were lost, the majority of them being children. [58] Bangalore experienced a growth in its real estate market in the 1980s and 1990s, spurred by capital investors from other parts of the country who converted Bangalore's large plots and colonial bungalows into multi-storied apartments. [59] In 1985, Texas Instruments became the first multinational corporation to set up base in Bangalore. Other information technology companies followed suit and by the end of the 20th century, Bangalore had established itself as the Silicon Valley of India. [39] Today, Bangalore is India's third most populous city. During the 21st century, Bangalore has suffered terrorist attacks in 2008 , 2010 , and 2013 .
Geography
The Hesaraghatta Lake in Bangalore
Bangalore lies in the southeast of the South Indian state of Karnataka. It is in the heart of the Mysore Plateau (a region of the larger Precambrian Deccan Plateau ) at an average elevation of 900 m (2,953 ft). [60] :8 It is located at 12°58′N 77°34′E﻿ / ﻿12.97°N 77.56°E﻿ / 12.97; 77.56 and covers an area of 741 km2 (286 sq mi).

Against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka off to a flier with magnificent hundreds by Dilshan (161*) and Sangakkara (105*). With this century, Dilshan broke the earlier record of highest individual score by a Sri Lankan in World Cups by Aravinda (144). This century is also the highest individual score in an ODI without hitting a six. Bangladesh only scored 240/10 and Sri Lanka won the match by 92 runs.
Next match was against English, where English captain Eoin Morgan won the toss and elected to bat first. England openers started solidly, but, from 62/0, the innings was reduced to 101/3 in the 21st over. Joe Root and Morgan added 60 runs for the 4th wicket before the dismissal of Morgan. The fifth wicket partnership between Root and James Taylor yielded 98 runs in 11 overs. Taylor fell for 25, following which Root was also dismissed for a 108-ball 121. England were 265/6 in the 47th over, before Jos Buttler struck an unbeaten 39 in 19 balls to take the total to 309/6 at the end of 50 overs.
Sri Lankan innings began with Thirimanne being dropped on 3. His opening partner Dilshan was out for 44 immediately after their partnership had reached 100 runs. Sangakkara joined Thirimanne and the left-hand duo punished the England bowlers with each of the batsmen making hundreds. Thirimanne struck a six off the third ball of the 48th over to complete an emphatic 9-wicket victory. Thirimanne remained unbeaten on a 143-ball 139, while Sangakkara won the Man of the Match for his unbeaten 117 off just 86 balls. This was Sangakkara second consecutive century.
The match against Australians was a real thriller. Australia batted first where they posted a huge 376/9, with the help of brutal 51 ball century of Glenn Maxwell . Sri Lanka chasing was not good at first, where Thirimanne was got out early. but then Dilshan joined Sangakkara to a 196 run partnership. Dilshan hit six fours off an over, bowled by Mitchell Johnson , which was the first time this has happened in World Cup history. After dismissal of Dilshan, the middle-order failed to gain partnerships with Sangakkara, who batting really well. Sangakkara scored his third consecutive century. With Sanga's wicket, Sri Lanka lost wickets quickly and scored 312/9 in 50 overs. Australia won the match by 64 runs. In the last group stage match, Sri Lanka easily defeated Scotland by 148 runs. Sangakkara scored his fourth consecutive century by scoring 124 runs. He became the first batsmen in ODI history to score 4 ODI centuries'. Sri Lanka scored 363/9. Scotland only scored 215 runs.
In the quarter final, Sri Lanka met South Africans. The match was a shock to all the fans across the globe, where Sri Lanka scored 133 runs all out. Sanga scored 45 runs and all the others were struggled by South African impressive bowling attack- Dale Steyn , Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir . South Africa won the match very easily, only one wicket fell. With this match, Sanga and Jayawardena ended their ODI career. This match gave Lankans, their first defeat without making for the semi-finals after 1999 World Cup.
Whitewashing[ edit ]
In 2004, Sri Lankan cricket team whitewashed South Africa 5–0 in an ODI series in Sri Lanka, which is the heaviest defeat of a South African cricket team in a bilateral One Day International series. [6] Sri Lanka whitewashed England 5–0 in the NatWest Series in 2006, which is England's heaviest home defeat in a bilateral ODI Series. [7] Sanath Jayasuriya was the Man of the Series . Sri Lanka also whitewashed Zimbabwe 5–0 in two ODI series, which took place in Zimbabwe in 2004 and 2008. Sri Lanka also whitewashed Bangladesh in many occasions. On 2015-16 season, Sri Lanka whitewashed West Indies 3-0 for the first time.
Despite of Whitewashing other teams, Sri Lanka was involved in a whitewash. During Sri Lanka's tour of India , Sri Lanka lost all five matches to India. India whitewashes Sri Lanka for the first time in ODI series and was Sri Lanka's biggest loss since winning the 96 World Cup .

Kingsmead, Durban , where India recorded their highest ever total in a Twenty20 International
A Twenty20 International (T20I) is a form of cricket match which is played over 20 overs per side between two national cricket teams. The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket. The first T20I was played between Australia and New Zealand on 17 February 2005. [1] The Indian cricket team played its first T20I match—under the captaincy of Virender Sehwag —on 1 December 2006, against South Africa at the Wanderers Stadium , Johannesburg . [2] [3] [4] In the only T20I match of the series , India won by six wickets. [4] As of October 2015, India is the eighth-most successful T20I team, having played 57 T20I matches with 31 wins, [5] and a tie against Pakistan .

Philanthropy[ edit ]
Muralitharan, along with his manager Kushil Gunasekara, established the Foundation of Goodness, [191] a charity organization, in the early 2000s. This organization is committed to the wellbeing of the Seenigama region (in southern Sri Lanka) and supports local communities through a range of projects across areas including children's needs, education and training, health care and psycho-social support, housing, livelihoods, sport and the environment. Murali’s Seenigama project raised funds from cricketers and administrators in England and Australia. Canadian pop-star Bryan Adams donated a swimming pool. [192]
Muralitharan also plans to build a second sports complex for war-displaced civilians in Mankulam , a town located 300 kilometers from north of Colombo. The two-year one million dollar project aims to build a sports center, a school, English and IT training centers and an Elders' home. [192] While the Sports Complex remains the main project, Foundation of Goodness also plans to help educate children, youth and adults. English cricketer Sir Ian Botham visited Mankulam with Muralitharan, and later addressing the media in Colombo on 27 March 2011 said that he will consider a walk from Point Pedro (the extreme northern tip of Sri Lanka) to Dondra Head (the extreme southern tip of Sri Lanka) to raise funds for the project. [193]
In June 2004, Muralitharan also joined the United Nations World Food Program as an ambassador to fight hunger among school children. [194]
When the tsunami devastated Sri Lanka on 26 December 2004, Muralitharan galvanised into action to ensure that aid reached people that needed it. [195] He himself narrowly escaped death, [196] arriving 20 minutes late at Seenigama, where he was to give away prizes at one of the charity projects he worked on. While international agencies were bringing food in by air, there was an urgent need for transport, and Murali organised three convoys of 10 trucks each, paying for these himself, to get the food to people who needed it. [197] He persuaded those who could to donate clothes, and supervised the delivery himself.
During the hard work of rehabilitation in the tsunami's aftermath, cement was in short supply. Muralitharan promptly signed an endorsement deal with Lafarge, a global cement giant, that was a straight barter, where cement would be supplied to the Foundation for Goodness in exchange for work Muralitharan did. During the first three years since the tsunami, the foundation raised more than US$ 4 million to help survivors, and has built homes, schools, sports facilities and computer centres. [198]
Beyond Cricket[ edit ]
On 1 August 2015, Murali himself with another Sri Lankan crickter Tillakaratne Dilshan appointed as the Brand Ambassadors for the Presidential Task Force to combat kidney disease by the President Maithripala Sirisena . [199] [200]

The Kolkata Knight Riders made a good start the season by winning their first two matches against Royal Challengers Bangalore and Deccan Chargers . Kolkata Knight Riders' opening batsman Brendon McCullum scored 158 runs in the first match. However, the team began to experience failures and lost the next four matches. The team managed to stage a comeback of sorts by winning the next three matches, helped by strong performances by Sourav Ganguly and Shoaib Akhtar . But their performance dipped again and they lost the next three matches. These included their match against Mumbai Indians , in which they were bowled out for 67 runs, the lowest score by a team in the IPL 2008 season. [12] When their match against Delhi Daredevils was washed out due to rain, they lost any chance of making it to the semi finals. [13] The Knight Riders ended their season on a winning note by defeating Kings XI Punjab on their home ground.
The team faced various issues in its first season such as team composition, Ganguly's choice of batting first in the game against Chennai Super Kings , entertainment tax being imposed for matches played at Eden Gardens. [14] Shahrukh Khan was barred by the International Cricket Council from entering the dressing room of the team when matches were in progress. He then issued a statement that he would be boycotting the remaining matches of the IPL until the code of conduct was clarified by the IPL authorities. [15]
Financially, the Kolkata Knight Riders were easily the most successful franchise in the IPL, achieving a profit of ₹ 130 million (US$1.9 million) in the opening season itself. [16]
2009 IPL season[ edit ]
Main article: 2009 Indian Premier League
The season is by far the worst in the history of the franchise. Kolkata Knight Riders finished at the bottom of the ranking table with three wins and ten losses including a string of nine successive defeats. KKR was among the least active franchises during the offseason, with no player trades. However, the team signed Mohnish Parmar during the offseason and also re-signed Ajantha Mendis to a long term deal.
On 18 April 2009 a blog by an anonymous author claiming to be a member of the team surfaced on the web. The blog was controversial from the start, giving unflattering nicknames to players, coaches, and owners of KKR and other teams, telling sordid stories, and showing most of them in a very negative light. [17] The blog rapidly became popular and created a lot of media frenzy. [17] The blog worsened an already bad season for KKR, which lost most of their games, had controversies surrounding their coach, John Buchanan , and frequently changed captains, including Sourav Ganguly and Brendon McCullum based on a series of theories discussing "multiple-captains". [18] In August 2010, Bangalore based marketing specialist Anupam Mukerji revealed himself to be the person behind the blog. He said he had "never met a cricketer in his life", and was just making up stories. He never expected it to become this big, he remarked, adding that the Fake Player ended up getting legitimized by the media frenzy. He was inspired by the popularity of a similar blog by Fake Steve Jobs , and the Richard Gere movie The Hoax . [19] [20] [21]
KKR also set up a Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) in 2009 to spot local talent nationwide. This was based on BCCI 's 2002–06 model which had discovered talents like MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina . The wing was headed by Makarand Wainganker, who had first initiated the TRDW concept for the KSCA . [22] However, Wainganker eventually resigned after persistent disagreements with John Buchanan over team selection and Buchanan's "multiple captains" theory. [23] KKR were the first team in IPL to select their cheerleaders by a talent hunt show called Knights and Angels , judged by Sourav Ganguly and other guest stars and hosted by Bollywood actor Purab Kohli . However, the six girls who were part of the winning team did not get a chance to perform during the 2009 season since local authorities only allowed South African cheerleaders to be hired. [24] Despite not performing, they were presented with the opportunity to accompany the team and watch the matches in South Africa in a nine days all-expense paid trip. [24]
Despite the poor on field performance of the team and its struggle at the bottom of the points table, the Kolkata Knight Riders has been ranked as the richest team in the tournament with a brand value of $42.1 million. [25] The study conducted by a UK-based international brand valuation consultancy took into account various revenue lines such as broadcasting, IPL sponsorship, team sponsorship, merchandising and gate receipts as well as the effect of performance, the catchment population of the city, the capacity of the stadium and the presence of iconic players. [25]
2010 IPL season[ edit ]
Main article: 2010 Indian Premier League
The Kolkata Knight Riders traded Australian all-rounder Moises Henriques for Manoj Tiwary and Owais Shah . [26] At the Player auctions they managed to successfully buy Shane Bond in the silent tie-breaker against competing bids from Deccan Chargers for $1.3 million. [27] Ganguly was once again given the captaincy of KKR, after the team ended at the bottom in the second season. The coach John Buchanan was replaced by Dav Whatmore.
The Kolkata Knight Riders had a fantastic start to the season with two consecutive wins against Deccan Chargers and Royal Challengers Bangalore. That was followed by three defeats at the hands of Chennai Super Kings , Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians. The Knight Riders then made a come back by winning most of their homes games against Kings XI Punjab , Deccan Chargers and Delhi Daredevils . Despite being tied at 14-point with The Super Kings, Delhi Daredevils and Royal Challengers Bangalore, a lesser NRR meant they eventually finished sixth on the point table.
2011 IPL season[ edit ]
Main article: 2011 Indian Premier League
In this edition of the IPL, the Kolkata Knight Riders decided to revamp the team, starting with a new look and by changing the entire set of players. Gautam Gambhir , who was bought for a record-breaking $2.4 million was appointed as skipper. KKR also managed to buy Yusuf Pathan for $2.1 million. Other international names added to the squad included allrounders Shakib Al Hasan and Jacques Kallis , pace bowler Brett Lee and Ryan ten Doeschate of Netherlands. [28] Brad Haddin was replaced by Mark Boucher in mid-season due to a finger injury he sustained during practice. [29]
The Kolkata Knight Riders had a disappointing start of season, losing to Chennai Super Kings by 2 runs. But they came back stronger, winning their next three matches against Deccan Chargers and Rajasthan Royals at Kolkata and Jaipur respectively. After two consecutive defeats in their home ground, the team had a string of wins against Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab and Deccan Chargers. They went on to win two of the remaining four matches; one against Chennai Super Kings in Kolkata and the other against Pune Warriors India in Navi Mumbai which enabled them to qualify for the playoffs for the first time. [30] In the eliminator they lost to Mumbai Indians owing to a last over by Lakshmipathy Balaji which conceded 21 runs, losing their chance to enter the finals for the first time. [30]
In the 2011 auctions, Sourav Ganguly was not picked by KKR, nor by any other team in the league. This created a huge uproar in Kolkata. The angry fans created a protest group called No Dada No KKR . [31] This was followed by a silent protest rally, signature campaigns throughout the country and abroad and stadium protests. [31] But the uproar came to a halt and the fans' reactions gradually bettered as the team's performance improved and the Eden Gardens began to witness huge capacities. [32] [33] KKR finished the top amongst all teams after the completion of the mid season game-play. [30]
2011 CLT20 season[ edit ]
Main article: 2011 Champions League Twenty20
KKR's top four finish meant they would now participate in the qualifying stage for the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 , held from 19 to 21 September. Captain Gautam Gambhir wasn't able to lead the team during the qualifying stage, as he has been recovering from an injury he sustained during a Test match between India and England at The Oval. Jacques Kallis was the appointed captain in Gambhir's absence. However, Gambhir returned to lead the team in the Group stage. KKR was also without the services of Eoin Morgan, who was due to have a shoulder surgery, and Mark Boucher who was playing for Warriors.
They were drawn along with Somerset and Auckland Aces in Pool B of qualification stage. Both of their matches were initially to be played at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata , but was later moved to the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad . They recorded a 2-run victory in their first match against Auckland Aces, thanks to brilliant spells from Iqbal Abdulla and Yusuf Pathan . Their next match against Somerset Sabres ended in an 11-run defeat. However, both teams qualified for the main tournament by finishing on a better NRR+ than Sri Lankan franchise Ruhuna Rhinos of Pool A.
The team was placed with Somerset, Southern Redbacks , Warriors and fellow IPL team Royal Challengers Bangalore in Group B of the tournament. They lost their first two matches against Somerset Sabres and Southern Redbacks. They made an impressive comeback by winning the last two games, first by 9 wickets against Royal Challengers Bangalore and a rain affected 22 run victory by (D/L) against Warriors. However, despite being tied on points, they could not make the semi-final due to a lesser NRR+ than the Royal Challengers. They ended up fifth on the overall points table.
2012 IPL season[ edit ]
(l-r) Shahrukh Khan , Juhi Chawla and Jay Mehta , co-owners of KKR in 2012.
Due to the disbanding of Kochi Tuskers Kerala , each team played the remaining eight teams twice, once at home and once away. Therefore, each team played 16 matches. KKR bought back Brendon McCullum for $900,000 and West Indies Sunil Narine for $700,000. They also bought South-African Marchant de Lange for $50,000. The team replaced coach Dav Whatmore by Trevor Bayliss . [34] Kolkata Knight Riders also launched a new marketing campaign titled "New Dawn. New Knights" and a new logo. [35]
The 2012 IPL was then the most successful season for the franchise. [36] KKR got off to a poor start in the tournament, losing their first two games against Delhi Daredevils and Rajasthan Royals . However, they fought back with consecutive wins over Royal Challengers Bangalore and Rajasthan Royals. In the next match, however, they messed up an easy chase against Kings XI Punjab , losing narrowly by 2 runs. KKR's West Indian spinner Sunil Narine took the only five-wicket haul of the tournament (5–19) in that match and despite his team losing, he was declared as the Man of The Match. KKR then went on to win six matches in a row (except for a washed-out match against Deccan Chargers ). However, the team's performances dipped in the following two matches, losing against Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings . Eventually the team had a timely return to form, when they beat Mumbai Indians and Pune Warriors India in successive away matches, with the side bowling economically to defend average totals. This earned a second-place finish for the team at the end of the league stage and a semi-final match against Delhi Daredevils. An all-round performance from them saw Delhi being defeated by 18 runs, and KKR also qualifyiunding rural areas are a part of the Bangalore Rural district .

The topology of Bangalore is generally flat, though the western parts of the city are hilly. The highest point is Vidyaranyapura Doddabettahalli , which is 962 metres (3,156 feet) and is situated to the north-west of the city. [62] No major rivers run through the city, although the Arkavathi and South Pennar cross paths at the Nandi Hills , 60 kilometres (37 miles) to the north. River Vrishabhavathi , a minor tributary of the Arkavathi, arises within the city at Basavanagudi and flows through the city. The rivers Arkavathi and Vrishabhavathi together carry much of Bangalore's sewage . A sewerage system, constructed in 1922, covers 215 km2 (83 sq mi) of the city and connects with five sewage treatment centres located in the periphery of Bangalore. [63]
In the 16th century, Kempe Gowda I constructed many lakes to meet the town's water requirements. The Kempambudhi Kere, since overrun by modern development, was prominent among those lakes. In the earlier half of 20th century, the Nandi Hills waterworks was commissioned by Sir Mirza Ismail ( Diwan of Mysore, 1926–41 CE) to provide a water supply to the city. Currently, the river Kaveri provides around 80% of the total water supply to the city with the remaining 20% being obtained from the Thippagondanahalli and Hesaraghatta reservoirs of the Arkavathi river. [64] Bangalore receives 800 million litres (211 million  US gallons ) of water a day, more than any other Indian city. [65] However, Bangalore sometimes does face water shortages, especially during summer- more so in the years of low rainfall. A random sampling study of the Air Quality Index (AQI) of twenty stations within the city indicated scores that ranged from 76 to 314, suggesting heavy to severe air pollution around areas of traffic concentration. [66]
Bangalore has a handful of freshwater lakes and water tanks , the largest of which are Madivala tank, Hebbal lake, Ulsoor lake, Yediyur Lake and Sankey Tank . Groundwater occurs in silty to sandy layers of the alluvial sediments. The Peninsular Gneissic Complex (PGC) is the most dominant rock unit in the area and includes granites , gneisses and migmatites , while the soils of Bangalore consist of red laterite and red, fine loamy to clayey soils. [66]
Vegetation in the city is primarily in the form of large deciduous canopy and minority coconut trees. Though Bangalore has been classified as a part of the seismic zone II (a stable zone), it has experienced quakes of magnitude as high as 4.5. [67]
Climate
Bangalore has a tropical savanna climate ( Köppen climate classification Aw) with distinct wet and dry seasons. Due to its high elevation, Bangalore usually enjoys a more moderate climate throughout the year, although occasional heat waves can make summer somewhat uncomfortable. [68] The coolest month is December with an average low temperature of 15.4 °C (59.7 °F) and the hottest month is April with an average high temperature of 36 °C (97 °F). [69] The highest temperature ever recorded in Bangalore is 38.9 °C (102 °F) (recorded in March 1931). However, the suburbs of bangalore recorded temperatures as high as 41 °C (106 °F) which are now part of present-day Bangalore. The lowest ever recorded is 7.8 °C (46 °F) (recorded in January 1884). [70] [71] Winter temperatures rarely drop below 12 °C (54 °F), and summer temperatures seldom exceed 37 °C (99 °F). Bangalore receives rainfall from both the northeast and the southwest monsoons and the wettest months are September, October and August, in that order. [69] The summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent thunderstorms , which occasionally cause power outages and local flooding. The heaviest rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period is 179 millimetres (7 in) recorded on 1 October 1997. [72]

Personal life[ edit ]
Yusuf was born in the Pathan family, who are of Pashtun (Pathan) ancestry (belonging to the Pathan community in Gujarat ). [2] Yusuf married Mumbai based physiotherapist Afreen on 27 March 2013. His wife gave birth to a boy on 17 April 2014. [3]
Career[ edit ]
Following his impressive performances in the 2007 Deodhar Trophy and the Inter-state domestic Twenty20 competition held in April 2007, Pathan was made a part of the Indian squad for the inaugural Twenty20 World Championship , held in South Africa in September 2007. He made his Twenty20 international debut in the final against Pakistan. He opened the batting for India in the match, and scored 15 runs in the process. [4]
Following his good showing in the IPL, he was selected for the Indian one-day team . After IPL, though he played all the games in the Kitply Cup and Asia Cup, he got to bat only four times and could not perform well with both bat and ball. He was later dropped from the series against Sri Lanka. He performed well in domestic circuit and impressed the selectors and was selected for the England ODI series in November. He scored a fifty off just 29 balls in the second ODI against England in Indore , on his 26th birthday. [5]
Yusuf had made his One-Day International debut for India against Pakistan at Dhaka on 10 June 2008. He became a regular feature of the national One-Day International team, but is yet to make his test debut. [6]
Even though Pathan could not repeat his first IPL performance in the second season, he was selected in the Indian team to play the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 championships in England. In the second of India's Super 8 matches, he made an unbeaten 33 from 17 balls against England. Despite his knock, the team lost the game and crashed out of the tournament without making it to the semi-finals.He consider himself lucky for his rare international debut which came in the final of the ICC World Twenty20 in 2007.
In late-2009, Pathan was dropped from the limited overs team after a series of unproductive performances.
In the final of the 2010 Duleep Trophy cricket tournament, Pathan scored a hundred in the first innings and a double hundred in the second and led his team West Zone to a three wicket win over South Zone . Pathan made 108 in the first innings and an unbeaten 210 from 190 balls in the second innings to help his team chase down a mammoth target of 536. This became a world record for the highest successful run chase in first-class cricket history. [7]
On 7 December 2010, Pathan's power hitting sealed a memorable 5-wicket win for India. Pathan clobbered the New Zealand attack with his aggressive innings, smashing an unbeaten 123 from 96 balls and shared an unbroken 133-run partnership with Saurabh Tiwary to guide India to a huge target of 316 with seven balls to spare and give the hosts a 4-0 lead in the series. He was named man of the match for this effort. The all-rounder clubbed seven fours and seven sixes on the way to his maiden one-day century to help the hosts overhaul New Zealand's challenging 315-7 with seven balls to spare at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore .
At the awards distribution ceremony he stated that "this knock will boost my career". Indian captain Gautam Gambhir said "I have always said Pathan can finish games on his own, and that's what he did today, I had never seen something like this before. But I knew till the time Pathan was there, we would win the game." [8]
New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori said "It was a great game of cricket, we were in the game, but Pathan was pretty amazing and took the game away from us."
In the MTN ODI series against South Africa , before the 2011 World Cup, he gave a stand-out performance in a match in Pretoria where he scored a brilliant 105 in 70 deliveries (comprising 8 fours and 8 sixes). Even though India lost the match, his performance was complimented heavily. [9] During this knock, he reached his century off 68 balls which is the sixth fastest by an Indian and the second fastest by an Indian outside the subcontinent. Thanks to his stream of good performances, he made it to the Indian team for 2011 World Cup. [1ng for their maiden IPL final.
The final between the Knight Riders and the defending two-time champions Chennai Super Kings was held at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium . [37] A hamstring injury to Lakshmipathy Balaji resulted in the inclusion of Brett Lee and due to him being a foreign player, the team was required to leave out their wicket-keeper batsman Brendon McCullum to maintain the cap of 4 foreign players. Manvinder Bisla was brought in to replace McCullum. [37] The team eventually won the match with the help of some impressive batting performance by Bisla (89 from 48 balls) and Jacques Kallis (69 from 49 balls) to become the champions of the tournament for the first time. [37] Manvinder Bisla was declared Man of the Match and Sunil Narine was named Man of the Series. [37]
There were some eye-catching performers for KKR in IPL 5, particularly on the bowling front. Sunil Narine was the second-highest wicket-taker as well as player of the tournament, and also had the best economy rate in the tournament. [38] The batting was led by skipper Gautam Gambhir , who was the second-highest run-getter of the tournament and scored 6 half-centuries out of a total of 11 from his team. [39] [40]
The state of West Bengal set up a grand felicitation involving Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee and Governor of West Bengal M K Narayanan . [41] The Cricket Association of Bengal gifted the 17 members of the team with gold chain each and mementos. [41] A victory parade for the team members was also organized on 28 May beginning from Hazra, Writers Building to the Eden Garden stadium where ten thousand spectators came to cheer for the team during a one-hour celebration that was compared to the India's World Cup victory lap at the Wankhede in Mumbai the year before. [41] However, the celebration received criticism from media and certain political parties and had been ridiculed by some pools of society as it had only been organized for a club team. [41] Shahrukh Khan , the team's co-owner and the state's brand ambassador, defended the decision." [41]
2012 CLT20 season[ edit ]
Main article: 2012 Champions League Twenty20
KKR's maiden IPL victory in 2012 meant that they would now participate in the 2012 Champions League Twenty20 which was held in South Africa. They were in Group A along with Delhi Daredevils, Perth Scorchers, Auckland Aces and Titans. But disappointingly, they were eliminated in the group stage itself, winning only one game against the Titans, which they did so with a record breaking 99 run margin. This was the highest victory margin ever recorded in the CLT20 tournament. Losses to Delhi Daredevils and Auckland Aces followed by a washed out game against Perth meant that KKR finished 3rd in Group A and failed to qualify for the knock out stages of the tournament. [42]
2013 IPL season[ edit ]
Main article: 2013 Indian Premier League
KKR had a disappointing IPL season in 2013, as they failed to make the play-offs, losing ten and winning only six out of their sixteen matches. Although their performance was disappointing, a few players performed really well, like Sunil Narine who took 22 wickets in 16 matches and Gautam Gambhir who made some good runs. But due to lack of rhythm and perfect combination of players, and bad form of a few players, the KKR could not win few easy matches and ended up 7/9.
2014 IPL season[ edit ]
Main article: 2014 Indian Premier League
Knight Riders retained only their captain Gambhir and spinner Sunil Narine as they went into the 2014 IPL auctions. They bought back Jacques Kallis, Yusuf Pathan, Shakib Al Hasan, Manvinder Bisla and Ryan Ten Doeschate. New additions to the side were Robin Uthappa , Manish Pandey , Morne Morkel , Umesh Yadav , Piyush Chawla , Vinay Kumar , Chris Lynn along with some other uncapped and foreign players. KKR had a good start to the seventh edition in UAE , defeating defending champions Mumbai Indians in the inaugural match. However, their performance dipped and they won only 1 out of their next 4 games played there, including a super over tie against Rajasthan Royals, which they ultimately lost on a boundary count. Their poor form continued as they lost two more matches after they were back in India, making it five losses in seven games. The team changed their batting order, promoting Robin Uthappa as an opener which worked very well as he became the highest run scorer in the tournament with 660 runs. He also scored 40+ runs in 10 consecutive matches. Sunil Narine continued his great run, being the second highest wicket taker. Knight Riders recovered from the losing streak, winning each of their next 7 games. In their last group game against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, Yusuf Pathan blitzed his way to a half century off just 15 balls, which is a record in the IPL. After the group stage, they were tied at 18 points with Chennai Super Kings but beat them to the second place in points table by a better net run rate.
They played the first Qualifier at their homeground Eden Gardens against Kings XI Punjab which they won by 28 runs and entered the final for the second time in their history. In the final at Bengaluru , they met Kings XI Punjab again and defeated them by 3 wickets in a thrilling match chasing a mammoth 200, with local boy Manish Pandey delivering his best knock of the season with a brilliant 94 in 50 balls, to win their second title in 3 years. The victory was celebrated grandly in a similar fashion to their 2012 Indian Premier League title win.
Livery[ edit ]
Initially, when Kolkata Knight Riders were first introduced in 2008, the logo of the team consisted of a blazing golden Viking helmet against a black background with the name of the team Kolkata Knight Riders written in gold next to it. However, the black background was changed to purple in the third season. In 2012, a new logo, which consist of a blazing purple Corinthian helmet trimmed with gold, with Kolkata Knight Rider written within a shield has been introduced. [43] The name Knight Riders has been chosen keeping in view the kids and the youth.
The tag line of the team was "All the King's Men" during the first four season. [44] However, in the fifth it was replaced by "New Dawn, New Knights". The team's official colours were black and gold during the first two seasons. Khan explained that "golden symbolizes spirit of life and black presents the Goddess Kali. " [44] It was later changed to purple and gold during the third season and was kept so. The jersey was created by Bollywood fashion designer Manish Malhotra . [44]
The main theme of the team Korbo, Lorbo, Jitbo Re (We will do it, Fight for it, Win it) has been created by Vishal-Shekhar duo. [44] A Knight Rider album with several singers and music composers including Usha Uthup and Bappi Lahiri was also created. [45] In 2009, A music video for one of the songs from the album, called "Too Hot, Too cool" directed by Farah Khan and featuring Khan and some of the members of the team was filmed in helipad area in Film City, Mumbai. The theme of the video centred around the African wild life as the IPL 2's venue had been shifted to South Africa at the time. [46]
Home ground[ edit ]
The home venue of the Knight Riders is the iconic Eden Gardens (with the two ends of the crease called the High Court End and the Pavilion End). Owned by the Cricket Association of Bengal , it is the largest cricket stadium in India and had a seating capacity of over 90,000. [47] In 2011, the stadium was renovated to meet the standards set by the ICC for the 2011 Cricket World Cup ; reducing its capacity to around 67,000. The renovated stadium includes a new clubhouse and players' facilities, upgrading the exterior wall, cladding the existing roof structure with a new metal skin, and general infrastructure improvements. [48] In 2013, two of the team's home matches were hosted by the JSCA International Cricket Stadium in Ranchi .

Security concerns and controversy before the tour[ edit ]
Before the Australian cricket team was scheduled to tour India and play a series of Test matches, one-day internationals and Twenty20 matches, it was doubtful if the Australian cricket team would tour India after the terror attacks in Delhi and the press briefing given by India's National Security Advisor M. K. Narayan that raised issues of security concern in the minds of Australia's cricketers.
On 13 September 2008, serial bomb blasts took place in India's capital city Delhi in which 30 people died and over 100 people were injured. [8] The very next day after the blasts, Cricket Australia (CA) issued a statement saying that it will review the security situation in the wake of the blasts and will make its decision the next week after performing a risk assessment . [9] The Board of Control for Cricket in India , however, asserted that the blast would have no bearing on the cricket tour which would go ahead as scheduled. [10] However, a conflicting report made on 15 September claimed that Cricket Australia had briefed that the tour was on track. [11] Following these reports, the Pakistan Cricket Board lashed at the Australian cricket establishment for agreeing to tour India while postponing their tour to Pakistan in early 2008 and accused the board of adopting double standards. [12] One PCB official even called the Australians "lilly-livered cowards" [13] But Ricky Ponting issued a statement vindicating Cricket Australia's stand by saying that the circumstances accompanying the cancellation of Australia's tour of Pakistan were entirely different. [14] However, on 17 September 2008, Australia skipper Ricky Ponting said that the tour was not yet confirmed [15] and that it could go either way. [16]

History and development
With generous patronage from the Government of Karnataka , the foundation stone of this stadium was laid in 1969 and construction work commenced in 1970. The stadium was first used for First-class cricket matches during the 1972–73 season. It earned Test status during the 1974–75 season when the West Indies toured India.
The first Test played at this stadium was on 22–29 November 1974. Incidentally, this was the debut Test match for the West Indian batting giants Viv Richards and Gordon Greenidge . The West Indians led by Clive Lloyd crushed M. A. K. Pataudi 's Indian team by a massive margin of 256 runs. India registered their first Test win on this ground against the touring English team led by Tony Greig in 1976–77. The first ODI match at this venue was played on 6 September 1982. India defeated Sri Lanka by six wickets in that match.
Floodlights were first installed at this stadium for the 1996 Wills World Cup . The first match played here under lights was the quarter-final clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan on 9 March 1996 in which India defeated Pakistan by 39 runs in a thrilling encounter. In 2007, 3rd Test Match between India Vs Pakistan , Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh lead a 300 run partnership fightback from 61/4 breaking several records. India's 365/5 at stumps was the highest 1st day score in whole of India. The 300 run partnership was the highest partnership at the stadium and the highest left-hander batsmen partnership. Sourav Ganguly's 239 is the highest left-hander score.
After the BCCI chose Bangalore as the centre for the National Cricket Academy in 2000, many budding cricketers have passed out of the Academy housed on this ground. This stadium also served as venue for the 1996 Miss World pageant. The KSCA now plans to increase the seating capacity to 70,000. After the launch of the IPL, it has also become the home ground of the Bangalore franchise team, the Royal Challengers Bangalore. The stadium was also given a facelift for the first season of the IPL. It was painted in red and yellow, the team colours of the Royal Challengers and also the colours of the Karnataka flag.
The Chinnaswamy Stadium wicket
The cricket pitch at this stadium is seen to be typical – it rarely follows the 'turning track' axiom, which is followed by all other international-level cricket pitches in India. Of late, the Chinnaswamy stadium cricket pitch is said to be bouncy and pacy, which is something unprecedented in the history of Indian cricket. The 2012 season's Ranji Trophy matches, the India-New Zealand Test and the India-Pakistan T20 International matches saw fast bowlers grab significant number of wickets.
In the T20 International played here on 25 December 2012, Pakistan's left arm fast bowler, debutant Mohammad Irfan , arguably the tallest cricketer, troubled the Indian top order batsmen, with his pace and disconcerting bounce. In the same match, Indian fast bowler Bhuvaneshwar Kumar too troubled the Pakistani top order in his debut match, finishing with bowling figures of 3 for 9 in his allotted four overs. Though, India lost the match by five wickets.

MCC ruling, May 1894[ edit ]
Before 1895, "first-class cricket" was a common term used loosely to suggest that a match had a high standard; adjectives like "great" and "important" were also loosely applied to high standard matches. There was at the time no concept of what became Test cricket and so an international match would be called a first-class one, as would any match involving two major county clubs. At the beginning of the 1860s, there were only four formally constituted county clubs: Sussex County Cricket Club is the oldest, formed in 1839, and it had been followed by Kent , Nottinghamshire and Surrey . In the early 1860s, several more clubs were founded and questions began to be raised in the sporting press about which should be categorised as first-class, but there was considerable disagreement in the answers. In 1880, the Cricket Reporting Agency was founded. It acquired influence through the decade especially by association with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack (Wisden) and the press came to generally rely on its information and opinions. [1]
The term acquired official status, though limited to matches in Great Britain, following a meeting at Lord's Cricket Ground (Lord's) in May 1894 between the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) committee and the secretaries of the clubs involved in the official County Championship , which had begun in 1890. As a result, those clubs became first-class from 1895 along with MCC, Cambridge University , Oxford University , senior cricket touring teams (i.e.., Australia and South Africa at that time) and other teams designated as such by MCC (e.g., North v South , Gentlemen v Players and occasional "elevens" which consisted of recognised first-class players). [2] Officially, therefore, the inaugural first-class match was the opening game of the 1895 season between MCC and Nottinghamshire at Lord's on 1 and 2 May, MCC winning by 37 runs. [3]
ICC ruling, May 1947[ edit ]
Definition[ edit ]
The term "first-class cricket" was formally defined by the then Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) on 19 May 1947. It was made clear that the definition "will not have retrospective effect". [4] The definition is as follows: [4]
A match of three or more days' duration between two sides of eleven players officially adjudged first-class, shall be regarded as a first-class fixture. Matches in which either team have more than eleven players or which are scheduled for less than three days shall not be regarded as first-class. The Governing body in each country shall decide the status of teams.
For example, MCC was authorised to determine the status of matches played in Great Britain. For all intents and purposes, the 1947 ICC definition confirmed the 1894 MCC definition and gave it international recognition and usage.
Hence, official judgment of status is the responsibility of the governing body in each country that is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The governing body grants first-class status to international teams and to domestic teams that are representative of the country's highest playing standard. Later ICC rulings make it is possible for international 0] and also scored 100 for just 37 balls vs Mumbai Indians in IPL 2010 Though Yusuf did not have a great World Cup, he ended up having the winner's medal and the honor of holding the World Cup aloft.
He was named in the Indian team for 2012 Asia Cup to be held in Bangladesh . [11] He featured in the triangular series in Nairobi-Kenya and played for Baroda's team against Gujarat and Kenya international where he was honoured by a local fan who said "Yusuf the number one player in cricket after the great Sachin Tendulkar."
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
After a good domestic season in 2007/08, he was signed by the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League for USD 475,000 (INR 1.9 crore). In the 2008 IPL season , he scored 435 runs and took 8 wickets. He recorded the season's fastest half century (from 21 balls) against the Deccan Chargers , and was also the Man of the Match in the final against the Chennai Super Kings .
Yusuf Pathan was named as the vice-captain of Rajasthan Royals during IPL 3. On 13 March 2010, Pathan scored a century off 37 balls, in an Indian Premier League match against Mumbai Indians . The innings also included 11 consecutive hits to the boundary (6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4).
After that knock where he scored the fastest IPL century, his Rajasthan Royals skipper Shane Warne described his innings as one of the best innings he has even seen in his career and also compared Yusuf Pathan with his country-mate Andrew Symonds as two of the cleanest hitters of the ball.
In the 2011 IPL auction, he was bought for $2.1 million by Kolkata Knight Riders and was retained by the Kolkata Knight Riders for Rs 3.25 crores via the ‘Right to Match’ option in the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction 2014. [12]
On 24 May 2014, Yusuf hit the fastest 50 in IPL history doing it in a mere 15 balls. As a result, Kolkata Knight Riders ended up 2nd in the league table.
Domestic Cricket[ edit ]
In Ranji Trophy , he held the record of fastest 50 (in 18 balls) upto October,2015. His record was broken by Bandeep Singh (in 15 balls). [13]
Cricket Academy Of Pathans[ edit ]
The Cricket Academy Of Pathans was jointly launched by Yusuf and Irfan Pathan .The academy has tied up with former India coach Greg Chappell and Cameron Tradell as chief mentors. Chappell would coach the coaches of the Academy. [14]
Controversy[ edit ]
On 15 May 2013 Yusuf Pathan became the first batsman to be given out for obstructing the field in Twenty20 cricket while playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders in Match No. 65 of Pepsi IPL 2013 against Pune Warriors India. [15]

Physics of swing bowling[ edit ]
The Philadelphians' Bart King helped to perfect swing bowling in the early 20th century[ citation needed ]
The essence of swing bowling is to get the cricket ball to deviate sideways as it moves through the air towards or away from the batsman . In order to do this, the bowler makes use of five factors:
The raised seam of the cricket ball
The wear and tear on the ball
The polishing liquid used on the ball
The speed of the delivery
The bowler's action
The asymmetry of the ball is encouraged by the constant polishing of one side of the ball by members of the fielding team, while allowing the opposite side to deteriorate through wear and tear. With time, this produces a marked difference in the aerodynamic properties of the two sides.
Both turbulent and laminar airflow contribute to swing. Air in laminar flow separates from the surface of the ball earlier than air in turbulent flow, so that the separation point moves toward the front of the ball on the laminar side. On the turbulent flow side it remains towards the back, inducing a greater lift force on the turbulent airflow side of the ball. The calculated net lift force is not enough to account for the amount of swing observed. Additional force is provided by the pressure-gradient force .
To induce the pressure-gradient force the bowler must create regions of high and low static pressure on opposing sides of the ball. The ball is then "sucked" from the region of high static pressure towards the region of low static pressure. The Magnus effect utilises the same force but by manipulating spin across the direction of motion. A layer of fluid, in this case air, will have a greater velocity when moving over another layer of fluid than it would have had if it had been moving over a solid, in this case the surface of the ball. The greater the velocity of the fluid, the lower its static pressure.
When the ball is new the seam is used to create a layer of turbulent air on one side of the ball, by angling it to one side and spinning the ball along the seam. This changes the separation points of the air with the ball; this turbulent air creates a greater coverage of air, providing lift. The next layer of air will have a greater velocity over the side with the turbulent air due to the greater air coverage and as there is a difference in air velocity, the static pressure of both sides of the ball are different and the ball is both 'lifted' and 'sucked' towards the turbulent airflow side of the ball.
When the ball is older and there is an asymmetry in roughness the seam no longer causes the pressure difference, and can actually reduce the swing of the ball. Air turbulence is no longer used to create separation point differences and therefore the lift and pressure differences. On the rough side of the ball there are scratches and pits in the ball's surface. These irregularities act in the same manner as the dimples of a golf ball: they trap the air, creating a layer of trapped air next to the rough side of the ball, which moves with the surface of the ball. The smooth side does not trap a layer of air. The next layer of air outward from the ball will have a greater velocity over the rough side, due to its contact with a layer of trapped air, rather than solid ball. This lowers the static pressure relative to the shiny side, which swings the ball. If the scratches and tears completely cover the rough side of the ball, the separation point on the rough side will move to the back of the ball, further than that of the turbulent air, thereby creating more lift and faster air flow. This is why a new ball will swing more than an old ball. If the seam is used to create the turbulent air on the rough side, the tears will not fill as quickly as they would with laminar flow, dampening the lift and pressure differences.
Reverse swing occurs in exactly the same manner as conventional swing, despite popular misconception. Over time the rough side becomes too rough and the tears become too deep - this is why golf ball dimples are never below a certain depth, and so "conventional" swing weakens over time; the separation point moves toward the front of the ball on the rough side. When polishing the shiny side of the ball, numerous liquids are used, such as sweat, saliva, sunscreen, hair gel (which bowlers may apply to their hair before a game) and other illegal substances like Vaseline (applied to the clothing where the ball is polished). These liquids penetrate the porous surface of the leather ball. Over time the liquid expands and stretches the surface of the ball (which increases the surface area meaning more lift) and creates raised bumps on the polished side, due to the non-uniform nature of the expansion. The valleys between the bumps hold the air in the same manner as the tears on the rough side. This creates a layer of air over the shiny side, moving the separation point towards the back of the ball on the shiny side. The greater air coverage is now on the shiny side, giving rise to more lift and faster secondary airflow on that side. There is therefore lower static pressure on the shiny side, causing the ball to swing teams from associate members of the ICC to achieve first-class status but it is dependent on the status of their opponents in a given match. [5]
According to the ICC definition, a match may be adjudged first-class if: [5]
it is of three or more days scheduled duration
each side playing the match has eleven players
each side may have two innings
the match is played on natural, and not artificial, turf
the match is played at a venue which meets certain standard criteria re venues
the match conforms to the Laws of Cricket , except for only minor amendments
the sport’s governing body in the appropriate nation, or the ICC itself, recognises the match as first-class.
A Test match is a first-class match played between two ICC full member countries subject to their current status at the ICC and the application of ICC conditions when the match is played. [5]
A peculiarity of the two-innings match is the follow-on law. If the team that batted second is substantially behind on first innings total, it may be required to bat again (i.e., to immediately "follow on" from its first innings rather than the innings alternating as they would normally) in the third innings of the match. [6]
Recognised matches[ edit ]
In 2010, the ICC published its Classification of Official Cricket which includes the criteria with which a match must comply to achieve a desired categorisation. In the section on first-class cricket, there is a list of the types of match that should qualify. It is important to note, given the differences in opinion about what constitutes a first-class match, that the ICC clearly stipulates that its match type list "is not exhaustive and is merely indicative of the matches which would fall into the first-class definition". For example, the list includes matches of recognised first-class teams versus international touring teams; and the major domestic championships (using their then-current names) such as the County Championship , Sheffield Shield , Ranji Trophy , etc. [5]
No retrospective effect[ edit ]
The absence of any ICC ruling about matches played before 1947 (or before 1895 in Great Britain) is problematic for those cricket statisticians who wish to categorise earlier matches in the same way. They have responded by compiling their own match lists and allocating a strictly unofficial first-class status to the matches they consider to have been of a high standard. It is therefore a matter of opinion only with no official support. Inevitable differences have arisen and there are variations in published first-class statistics .
A key issue for the statisticians is when first-class cricket for their purpose is deemed to have begun. Writing in 1951, Roy Webber argued that the majority of matches prior to 1864 (i.e., the year in which overarm bowling was legalised) "cannot be regarded as first-class" and their records are used "for their historical associations". [7] This drew a line between what was important historically and what should form part of the statistical record. Hence, for pre-1895 (i.e., in Great Britain) cricket matches, "first-class" is essentially a statistical concept while the historical concept is broader and takes account of historical significance. Webber's rationale was that cricket was "generally weak before 1864" (there was a greater and increasingly more organised effort to promote county cricket from about that time) and match details were largely incomplete, especially bowling analyses, which hindered compilation of records. [7] According to Webber's view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1864 season between Cambridge University and MCC at Fenner's on 12 and 13 May, Cambridge winning by 6 wickets. [8] When the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS) published its Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles in 1982, it tentatively agreed with Webber's 1864 start date by saying that "the line between first-class and other matches becomes more easily discernible about that date". [9] A year earlier, the ACS had published its Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 – 1863 in which it listed all the known matches during that period which it considered to have historical importance. They did stipulate that they had taken a more lenient view of importance re matches played in the 18th century than they did of matches played in the 19th century. As they explained, surviving details of 18th century matches are typically incomplete while there is a fairly comprehensive store of data about 19th century matches. [10]
Subsequently, Webber's view has been challenged by those who suggest earlier dates for the commencement of "first-class statistics". Bill Frindall believed that 1815 should be the start to encompass the entire roundarm bowling phase of cricket's history. However, roundarm did not begin in earnest until 1827. In Frindall's view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1815 season between MCC and Middlesex at Lord's on 31 May and 1 June, Middlesex winning by 16 runs. [11] The most significant internet-based views are those of CricketArchive (CA) and ESPNcricinfo (CI), both of which hold that the earliest first-class match was Hampshire versus All-England at Broadhalfpenny Down on 24 and 25 June 1772. CA has numbered this match "f1" (i.e., first-class match number one) and CI as "First-Class # 1". [12] [13]
However commendable these views may be, they are not only unofficial but also entirely statistical. The 1772 match left a scorecard that is complete apart from the bowling analyses and so the data is sufficient for a statistical study, especially as the scorecard was itself the start of a trend and there are surviving scorecards from every season commencing 1772. The historical view centres on the historical significance of a match and its known contemporary importance measured by, as is often the case with early matches, the amount of money at stake. Other factors are the size of the crowd, if known, and the fact that a match was deemed notable enough to be reported in the press. The earliest match known to have been accorded superior status in a contemporary report (i.e., "a great match" in this case) and to have been played for a large sum of money was one in Sussex between two unnamed eleven-a-side teams contesting "fifty guineas apiece" in June 1697. [14] This major cricket match has enormous historical significance but has no value at all for statisticians as there is no surviving data.



Personal life[ edit ]
Zaheer Khan was born into a Marathi Muslim family [7] on 7 October 1978 in Shrirampur , Maharashtra , India to parents Zakia and Bakhtiyar Khan. He has an elder brother Zeeshan and younger brother Anees. Zaheer attended the New Marathi Primary school and the K. J. Somaiyya Secondary School in Shrirampur. He also played in the local Revenue Colony Cricket Club (RCC) in Shrirampur. [8] Zaheer was in a relationship with actress Isha Sharvani for 8 years. [7]
Career[ edit ]
Zaheer was selected in 2000 for the first intake of the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore . [9] He made his Test debut against Bangladesh and ODI debut against Kenya during the ICC KnockOut Trophy in the same year. [3]
In late 2005 pacemen Sreesanth and R. P. Singh made their international debuts and became regular members of the Indian team making it difficult for Zaheer to retain his position in the playing eleven. The Board of Control for Cricket in India demoted Zaheer from a B-grade to a C-grade contract at the end of the year. He returned for the 2005 tour of Pakistan, where India fielded three left arm pacemen and had difficulty dismissing Pakistan with a lack of variety in the bowling attack.
In Indian domestic cricket, Zaheer made his name playing for Baroda . In the 2000/01 Ranji Trophy final against Railways , Zaheer was Man of the Match with eight wickets, including a second innings haul of 5/43, in Baroda's narrow 21-run victory. [10] He transferred to Mumbai at the start of the 2006-07 Indian cricket season his debut for Mumbai until the final of the Ranji Trophy in which he totowards it, not away from it as in conventional swing.
The rough side tears hold the air more easily than the shiny side valleys, so to maintain the air within the valleys the initial air layer must have a very high velocity, which is why reverse swing is primarily, but not necessarily, achieved by fast bowlers. Due to the less static nature of the initial air layer it takes longer for the swing to occur, which is why it occurs later in the delivery. This is why conventional and reverse swing can occur in the same delivery.
Cold and humid weather tend to enhance swing, due to the lift force increasing with the density of the air. Colder air is more dense than warm air. The humidity is a measure of the water content in the air; although water vapour does not increase the mean density of the air since water molecules weigh less than nitrogen or oxygen molecules, tiny suspended droplets of condensed liquid water will certainly do so since water is 1000 times more dense than air.
Conventional swing[ edit ]
Jimmy Anderson , a swing bowler for the England cricket team
Typically, a swing bowler aligns the seam and the sides of the ball to reinforce the swing effect. This can be done in two ways:
Outswinger : An outswinger to a right-handed batsman can be bowled by aligning the seam slightly to the left towards the slips and placing the roughened side of the ball on the left. To extract consistent swing, a bowler can also rotate his wrist toward the slips while keeping his arm straight. To a right-handed batsman, this results in the ball moving away to the off side while in flight, usually outwards from his body.
Inswinger : An inswinger to a right-handed batsman can be bowled by aligning the seam slightly to the right and placing the roughened side of the ball on the right. To extract consistent swing, a bowler can also rotate or "open up" his wrist towards leg slip. To a right-handed batsman, this results in the ball moving in to the leg side while in flight, usually inwards towards his body.
The curvature of swing deliveries can make them difficult for a batsman to hit with his bat . Typically, bowlers more commonly bowl outswingers, as they tend to move away from the batsman, meaning he has to "chase" the ball in order to hit it. Hitting away from the batsman's body is dangerous, as it leaves a gap between the bat and body through which the ball may travel to hit the wicket . Also, if the batsman misjudges the amount of swing, he can hit the ball with an edge of the bat. An inside edge can ricochet on to the wicket, resulting in him being out bowled, while an outside edge can fly to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders for a catch.
An inswinger presents relatively fewer dangers to the batsman, but on some particular days can be devastating due to risk of being bowled or leg before wicket . Shane Bond was considered a great exponent of inswing bowling.
An inswinger combined with a yorker can be especially difficult for the batsman to defend against, especially if used as a surprise delivery after a sequence of outswingers.
Reverse swing[ edit ]
Normal swing occurs mostly when the ball is fairly new. As it wears more, the aerodynamics of the asymmetry change and it is more difficult to extract a large amount of swing. When the ball becomes very old—around 40 or more overs old—it begins to swing towards the shine. This is known as reverse swing—meaning a natural outswinger will become an inswinger and vice versa. [1] In essence, both sides have turbulent flow, but here the seam causes the airflow to separate[ clarification needed ] earlier on one side. The result is always a swing to the side with the later separation, so the swing is away from the seam.
Reverse swing tends to be stronger than normal swing, and to occur late in the ball's trajectory. This gives it a very different character from normal swing, and because batsmen experience it less often, they generally find it much more difficult to defend against. It is also possible for a ball to swing normally in its early flight, and then to alter its swing as it approaches the batsman. This can be done in two ways [2] one for the ball to reverse its direction of swing, giving it an 'S' trajectory: the other is for it to adopt a more pronounced swing in the same direction in which the swing is already curving; either alteration can be devastating for the batsman. In the first instance, he is already committed to playing the swing one way, which will be the wrong way to address swing which is suddenly coming from the opposite direction: in the second instance, his stance will be one which is appropriate for the degree, or extent, of the expected swing, and which could suddenly leave him vulnerable to LBW , being caught behind, or bowled. Two consecutive deliveries from Wasim Akram, one of each type, were considered to be the turning point of the 1992 World Cup Final . [2]
Pioneers and notable practitioners of reverse swing have mostly been Pakistani fast bowlers. In the early days of reverse swing, Pakistani bowlers were suspected of ball tampering to achieve the conditions of the ball that allow reverse swing. According to Shaharyar Khan , reverse swing was invented by Salim Mir, who played for the Punjab Cricket Club in Lahore and taught it to his team-mate Sarfraz Nawaz . [3] Sarfraz Nawaz introduced reverse swing into international cricket during the late 1970s, and passed their knowledge on to their team-mate Imran Khan , [4] who in turn taught the duo of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis . The English pair of Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones , having been taught by Troy Cooley and the Indian bowlers like Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar , are also well known for the ability to reverse swing. [5]
Playing swing bowling[ edit ]
Playing swing bowling is considered to be a hallmark of a batsman's skill.
Firstly, a batsman needs good eye reflexes which are considered to be a key skill when facing swing bowling. Secondly a batsman often needs to anticipate beforehand what the ball will do and adjust accordingly to play swing bowling. This can be done by observing the bowler's grip and action (which may have a marked difference depending on which type of swinger is to be delivered), by observing the field set, which may depend on the types of deliveries expected (as a rule outswingers will have more slips assigned) or by means of prior knowledge of the bowler; many can bowl or are proficient in only one type of swing. Traditional methods include the batsmen playing the ball as late as possible, and not playing away from the body. Other effective measures for combating swing bowling include standing well outside the crease, thus giving the ball less time to swing; and guessing the direction of swing based on the seam position observed in the ball's flight.
Since reverse swing occurs at faster speeds, later in the trajectory of the ball and with no real obvious change in action and grip (Waqar Younis from Pakistan for example had the same action and grip for nearly all his deliveries [6] ), batsmen with a quick eye and reflexes will do well. In his autobiography Wasim Akram mentions four batsmen— Rahul Dravid , Brian Lara , Aravinda De Silva and Martin Crowe —who had such reflexes and who were exceedingly difficult to bowl to. [7]
Controversy regarding reverse swing has never left modern cricket, as the Pakistani team was accused of ball tampering by the controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair during the fourth test against England in 2006 when the ball began to reverse swing after the 50th over. [8] His co-umpire Billy Doctrove supported him. A hearing subsequently found that there was insufficient evidence to convict anyone of ball tampering. [9]



Sri Lanka v India, 3rd Test, SSC, 5th day September 1, 2015

India fast bowler Ishant Sharma and Sri Lankan players Dhammika Prasad , Dinesh Chandimal and Lahiru Thirimanne have been charged by the Iost in a limbo between attack and consolidation. The tentativeness that has been conspicuously absent from their play crept in. Wickets were lost to wishy-washy shots, Guptill's missed prod at Glenn Maxwell, Kane Williamson's checked shot that sent a return catch to Mitchell Johnson.
Australia's sharp work in the field gave them no leeway. Nothing was misfielded, no catches were dropped, no easy singles conceded. Grant Elliott and Ross Taylor recovered somewhat, Elliott especially taking a leaf out of the Australian batting manual, moving the score along at a run a ball without looking like it.
Taylor never seemed quite in, though, and when he was out, New Zealand collapsed. Elliott had delivered New Zealand into this final with an unbeaten 84 in the chase against South Africa; here his 83 from 82 balls was not enough in setting up a target that would challenge Australia.
Defending 183, everything had to go right for New Zealand, they had to give themselves every possible chance of bowling Australia out. Four slips for Trent Boult to Warner was a good start. But by the fifth over, McCullum had uncharacteristically slashed the cordon to one, and Warner's edge off Tim Southee flew agonisingly wide of a diving Taylor, the sole slip.
On Friday night, McCullum enjoyed a night of horse-racing at Moonee Valley. He is a man who doesn't mind employing the occasional racing metaphor. His team had to set the pace here. Had they gone out hard and run out of energy, so be it. That has been the New Zealand way. Instead, they sat one out and one back, waiting for the Australians to flag. They never did.
Australia were too strong in too many areas. New Zealand can be proud to have reached their first World Cup final. But they will fly home wondering what might have been, and what they might have done differently.

International debut[ edit ]
Mathews made his List A debut for Sri Lanka Under-23s against New Zealand A at Police Park Ground, Colombo in September, 2005. He captained the Sri Lankan cricket team in the 2006 U-19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka. [2] He later made his first-class debut for Colombo Cricket Club in November, 2006.
Mathews began his international career in late-2008 with ambitions of becoming a genuine allrounder, but has since given primacy to his batting (to diminish his workload and avoid injuries), and effectively plays as a specialist batsman in the Test side. However, for the balance of the team, he still plays as a batting allrounder in the limited overs cricket. A more than useful strike rate of 84.06 has made him a damaging prospect in the final overs of the Sri Lankan innings. [3] [4]
He made his international debut in a One Day International against Zimbabwe in November 2008 and made his Test debut against Pakistan at Galle in July, 2009.
Test career[ edit ]
Angelo Mathews made his Test debut in Pakistan tour of Sri Lanka, 2009. The Test also marked the debuts of Abdur Rauf , Mohammad Amir and Saeed Ajmal . He scored his maiden half-century in the third Test of the series, played at Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, Colombo. His maiden ton came against Australia in September, 2011 in the same venue. [5] Mathews has an average record in Tests in countries such as Australia , South Africa and India , but up to now he has had limited opportunities to improve on it. His brilliant records at home and in countries like England and UAE make up for that. Two of his four centuries came in England  – against a high quality pace attack consisting of James Anderson and Stuart Broad  – in the famous Sri Lanka tour of England and Ireland, 2014. He has also flourished with the added responsibility of captaincy, averaging 86.62 in 13 matches. [5]
In February 2013, Mathews became Sri Lanka's youngest ever Test captain at 25, after having been groomed for the post for two years. He captained the Lankan team in its monumental Test series win in England (2014). His highest Test score (160 of 249 balls) also came in the second match of the series played at Headingley , Leeds . [3]
Captaincy (2013– present)[ edit ]
Angelo Mathews as captain at the toss with Nick Knight
After Kumar Sangakkara stepped down as ODI captain following the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 , Mathews was widely tipped to be Sri Lanka's next limited overs captain. [6] However, short tenures of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Mahela Jayawardene followed. [7] [8] [9] [10] After Sri Lanka's loss in the final of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 , the skipper Jayawardene stepped down as captain of the T20I side. Later that month, Mathews was appointed as the T20I captain with Lasith Malinga as his deputy. [1] In February 2013 Mathews was eventually named as ODI and Test captain succeeding Jayawardene. [11]
Mathews became an important member in Sri Lanka One Day team during the Sri Lanka tour of Australia in 2010/11. At the first match, on 3 November 2010, Mathews scored a magnificent match winning 77* runs with a partnership with Lasith Malinga , who also scored his only half-century. Sri Lanka were in trouble when he come into the crease, but finally won the match. In this match, Mathews along with Malinga, recorded the highest ninth wicket partnership in ODI history by scoring 132 runs for the ninth wicket. [12]
Mathews hit back-to-back centuries against England at Lord’s and Headingley to seal Sri Lanka’s first-ever Test series win in England. Under him, Sri Lanka also won the ODI series 3 – 2. The England tour was followed by a 2 – 0 win over Pakistan at home, where Mathews and his team ensured a winning send-off for Mahela Jayawardene from Tests. [13]
On 16 November 2014, Mathews scored his first ODI century against India at Ranchi . He hit four boundaries and ten huge sixes, but finally ended up in the losing side by century made by Indian skipper Virat Kohli . Under the captaincy of Mathews, however, lost all the matches in 5 ODI series against India in 2014. This is the largest lost by Sri Lanka in a bilateral series. [14]
Year 2014 was the limelight of Mathew's captaincy, where Sri Lanka won many bilateral ODI series and also the 2014 Asia Cup . [15] That year, he became the most successful ODI captain with 20 wins out of 32 matches and 62.50% of winning percentage. [16]
On 11 March 2015, during the last pool A match in 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup , against Scotland , Mathews scored the fastest fifty by a Sri Lankan in World Cups, and third fastest ODI fifty by a Sri Lankan after Sanath Jayasuriya and Kusal Perera . His fifty came from just 20 balls, where it includes 5 sixes and 1 four. [17]
Mathews was able to bring the team to quarter finals of the World Cup 2015 under his captaincy, where they lost the quarter final against South Africa on 18 March 2015. This defeat was Sri Lanka's first lost in World Cups after 2003, without reaching for the semi finals.
Angelo Mathews batting
Mathews became the fourth Sri Lankan all-rounder to took 100 ODI wickets with more than 3000 ODI runs after Sanath Jayasuriya , Aravinda de Silva , and Tillakaratne Dilshan . He took his 100th ODI wicket by lbw of Mohammad Hafeez on 26 July 2015. [18]
T20 career[ edit ]
In the Indian Premier League cricket, he currently plays for Delhi Daredevils . He is one of the most sought out players in the Premier League world, having been bought by the Pune Warriors for US $950,000. [4] In 2015,he was sold to Delhi Daredevils in IPL Auction at a price tag of Rs.7.5 Crores.
Personal life[ edit ]
Mathews was born in Colombo , to Tamil father Tyronne Mathews and Burgher mother Monica Mathews. [19] [20] Like Chaminda Vaas , the famous Sri Lankan bowler (1994–2009), Mathews is Roman Catholic and had his formal education in St. Joseph's College , Colombo. [2]
Mathews is married to his longtime partner, Heshani Silva. The wedding reception was held on 18 July 2013 at Cinnamon Grand Hotel with the presence of former president Mahinda Rajapakse . [21] [22]

Personal life[ edit ]
Dilshan born on October 14, 1976 in Kalutara to a family of a Malay father and a Sinhalese mother. He had his first education at Jaffna Sinhala Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Jaffna for few years, and then at the Kalutara Vidyalaya , where he started his cricket career as a teenager. Dilshan converted from Islam to Buddhism [5] at the early age of 16, and was known as Tuwan Mohammad Dilshan before his conversion. However, his childhood coach Ranjan Paranavitana said even though Dilshan carried a Muslim name, he and his brothers and sisters followed their mother's religion from their childhood [6] and once his parents separated he officially changed his religion and name. [7]
Dilshan was married to Nilanka Vithanage, and they have one boy- Resadu Tillakaratne. After divorced from Dilshan, Nilanka filed a case for giving monthly payments for child's future, against Dilshan. He has been issued with a notice to appear in court after 2011 Cricket World Cup, but he refused some of these notices. But now all are appear to be clear in both parts, where about 20,0000 LKR in each month should give for ex-wife and his son. Nilanka Vithanage is now married to another Sri Lanka cricketer, Upul Tharanga . [8] [9]
Dilshan is now married to Sri Lankan teledrama actress Manjula Thilini . Their marriage was celebrated in India during the 2008 IPL series. Dilshan has two daughters and one son from this second marriage. Their eldest daughter is Resandi Linama Tillakaratne, and second is Lasadi Dihasansa Tillakaratne. Only son, who is Dihela Dinhath Tillakaratne, is the youngest of all. [10]
Dilshan's brother, Tillakaratne Sampath , is a first-class cricketer in Sri Lanka. [11]
Dilshan is a popular icon in home. So, he is very occasionally participated in many local events and television programs. He also appointed as a special judge in Sirasa Superstar , Generation 4. [12] He also participated for many other entertainment events as well, due to his publicity through his wife being a former popular actress. [13] [14]
With the invention of his master stroke play-Dilscoop, Dilshan models his fashion line with the name 'Dil Scoop'. [15]
On 23 October 2014, Dilshan opened a small-scale luxury hotel, named as "Hotel ‘D Pavilion Inn’", situated at Stafford Lane in Kirulapana . The hotel was opened by the presence of former president of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapakse . [16] [17]
Early career[ edit ]
Dilshan played his test debut against Zimbabwe on 18 November 1999 at Bulawayo . He scored 9 runs on debut and was out lbw to a delivery off Henry Olonga . [18] However, Dlishan managed to score his maiden test century at the Harare Sports Club in the second test between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe . He scored an unbeaten 163* runs in the first innings and was awarded the player of the match award for his role in the Sri Lankan victory. [19] Dilshan achieved his highest test score in England , where he scored 193 runs in the second test at the Lord's cricket ground, against England . [20]
Dilshan's One-Day International debut also came during Sri Lanka's tour of Zimbabwe in 1999, where he scored 31 runs against Zimbabwe . [21] His maiden ODI century came against Netherlands on the 4 July 2006 where he smashed an unbeaten 117* runs along with Sanath Jayasuriya 's 157 to help Sri Lanka post the highest ever ODI score of 443 runs. [22]

Dilshan played almost all his international matches as a middle-order all-round batsman during his early years. However, by 2007, he was selected to open the batting with Sanath Jayasuriya in ODI game against India where he started to showcase himself as an attacking and threatening opening batsman . [23] Since 2007, his stroke play has included a host of aggressive strokes which has allowed him to dominate the ODIs arena on many occasions. Currently he is slotted as the permanent opening batsman for Sri Lanka as well as operating as a handy right-arm off-break bowler in ODI matches.
Dilshan is credited for the creation of the Dilscoop , which he stumbled upon and then perfected, during the Indian Premier League 2009 tournament. [24] His innovative stroke play is acknowledged by many commentators and pundits thereby earning the recognition of being known as one of the most aggressive batsmen of all time. Apart from his Dilscoop , Dilshan is a prolific player of width possessing the ability to hit nearly any delivery pitched outside the off-stump for runs, and has perfected a lethal cover drive against pace bowlers.
Dilshan playing against England in 2011
Dilshan was the top run scorer in the 2011 Cricket World Cup . He scored 500 runs from nine One Day international innings with a best score of 144 runs against Zimbabwe. He scored two centuries, two half centuries, 61 boundaries and four sixes during the tournament which ended at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai , India in April 2011.
Immediately after the end of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 , with Kumar Sangakkara stepping down as captain, Dilshan was appointed captain of Sri Lanka in all formats of the game.
However, his appointment as captain was questioned by cricket fans and pundits alike. Many wondered if he was the right man to lead Sri Lanka . While, Dilshan did score 193 runs against England at Lord's , and broke the record for the highest individual score made by a Sri Lankan [25] at the venue, plus leading Sri Lanka to their maiden test win in South Africa . [26] [27] Losses to England, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa put strain on his captaincy [28] which he relinquished in Jan 2012. [29]

Dilshan became the 5th player in international cricket to score centuries in all forms of the game. During the Australian tour of Sri Lanka in 2011, Dilshan scored an unbeaten century of 104* from just 54 balls in the first Twenty20 match of the series, [30] becoming the 5th player to achieve the milestone after West Indian Chris Gayle , New Zealander Brendon McCullum , Indian Suresh Raina and fellow Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardena and it is also the highest individual twenty20 international score by a Sri Lankan in the history. He scored the century from just 57 balls with 12 fours and 5 sixes. He achieved his century with a dilscoop hitting behind the wicket-keeper.
In December 2011, Sri Lanka registered their first ever Test wins in South Africa. This also became their first Test win under Dilshan's captaincy. However, after losing the Test series 2–1 and the subsequent ODI series 3–2, Dilshan resigned and was replaced by Mahela Jayawardene . In 2012, he was ranked the second-highest ODI run scorer, with 1119 runs, behind his team-mate Kumar Sangakkara .
Dilshan announced his retirement from Test cricket on 9 October 2013. [31] Dilshan retired from test cricket in 2013 with his last match being played against Bangladesh at the R. Premadasa Stadium . [32] Dilshan played 87 test matches amassing 5,492 runs along with 16 centuries and 39 wickets.
On 16 December 2014, on his 300 One-Day International, he scored his 18th One-Day International century and also passed the 9000 runs in ODIs. He became the 5th Sri Lankan cricker and 15th overall to achieve this landmark. He also took 3 crucial wickets in the match against England and aided Sri Lanka's title claim as the winners of the tournament. He won both man of the match award and man of the series award. [33]
TM Dilshan on his way to his 18th ODI century
On 23 January 2015, Dilshan scored his 20th One-Day International century against New Zealand, becoming the 10th batsmen to score 20 ODI centuries. [34]
On 26 February 2015, he scored an unbeaten 161* runs during the group stage match of 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against Bangladesh . This was his highest individual score in ODIs and was the highest score by a Sri Lankan in Cricket World Cup history, a title previously held by Aravinda de Silva and his 145 runs against Zimbabwe in 2003. This is also the highest individual score without a six in the ODI history. With this score of 161e desired time that the match should last. A pertinent division in terms of professional cricket is between matches limited by time in which the teams have two innings apiece, and those limited by number of overs, in which they have a single innings each. The former, known as first-class cricket , has a duration of three to five days (there have been examples of "timeless" matches too); the latter, known as limited overs cricket because each team bowls a limit of typically 50 or 20 overs, has a planned duration of one day only (a match can be extended if necessary due to bad weather, etc.).
Typically, two-innings matches have at least six hours of playing time each day. Limited overs matches often last six hours or more. There are usually formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea with brief informal breaks for drinks. There is also a short interval between innings.
Amateur cricketers rarely play matches that last longer than a single day; these may loosely be divided into declaration matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares ; and limited overs matches, in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team's innings individually. These will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at the weekend and the ever popular 20 over format during the evenings. Other forms of cricket, such as indoor cricket and garden cricket remain popular.
Historically, a form of cricket known as single wicket had been extremely successful and many of these contests in the 18th and 19th centuries qualify as major cricket matches. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began.
Test cricket
Main article: Test cricket
A Test match between South Africa and England in January 2005. The men wearing black trousers are the umpires . Teams in Test cricket, first-class cricket and club cricket wear traditional white uniforms and use red cricket balls .
Test cricket is the highest standard of first-class cricket. A Test match is an international fixture between teams representing those countries that are Full Members of the ICC.
Although the term "Test match" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 1876–77 Australian season . Subsequently, eight other national teams have achieved Test status: South Africa (1889), West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1929), India (1932), Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992) and Bangladesh (2000). Zimbabwe suspended its Test status in 2006 due to its inability to compete against other Test teams, [48] and returned in 2011. [49]
Welsh players are eligible to play for England , which is in effect an England and Wales team. The West Indies team comprises players from numerous states in the Caribbean , notably Barbados , Guyana , Jamaica , Trinidad & Tobago , the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands .
Test matches between two teams are usually played in a group of matches called a " series ". Matches last up to five days and a series normally consists of three to five matches. Test matches that are not finished within the allotted time are drawn. In the case of Test and first-class cricket : the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. [50]
Since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes . Some other bilateral series have individual trophies too: for example, the Wisden Trophy is contested by England and West Indies; the Frank Worrell Trophy by Australia and West Indies and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy between India and Australia.
Limited overs



Origins[ edit ]
Cricket itself was probably first played in England in the Late Middle Ages , but it did not rise to prominence until the eighteenth century. A set of laws were drawn up in 1744, and the game achieved a level of relative standardisation by the late nineteenth century. [1] One-day cricket was trialled in 1962, and the first domestic tournament played the following year, [2] and in 1971, England and Australia contested the first One Day International . The match consisted of one innings for each side, with 40 eight- ball overs . [3]
In the 1990s, a number of countries were exploring the possibility of a shorter game still: in New Zealand, Martin Crowe developed Cricket Max , in which each team bats for 10 eight-ball overs, [4] while in Australia they considered an eight-a-side contest they dubbed "Super 8s". At the same time, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) conducted consumer research, and proposed the idea of a 20 overs-per-side contest, which would last for about three hours. [5] The first match was played in 2003 between Hampshire and Sussex . [6]
History[ edit ]
The first Twenty20 International match between two men's sides was played on 17 February 2005, involving Australia and New Zealand . Wisden Cricketers' Almanack reported that "neither side took the game especially seriously", [7] and it was noted by ESPNcricinfo that but for a large score for Ricky Ponting , "the concept would have shuddered". [8] Two further matches were played that year; England beat Australia in June, and South Africa were defeated by New Zealand in October. [9] Early the following year, a contest between New Zealand and the West Indies finished as the first tied match , and a tiebreak was played for the first time in men's international cricket: the two sides took part in a bowl-out to determine a winner; New Zealand won 3–0. [10]
The game had initially been developed to boost the interest in domestic cricket, and to aid this the international teams were only allowed to host three T20Is each year. The cricket manager for the ICC, David Richardson, also commented that "Part of the success of Twenty20 cricket is making sure it can coexist with Test cricket and one-dayers." [11] Despite this, the first international tournament was held in 2007 in South Africa; the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 . [11] That tournament was won by India , who defeated their close rivals Pakistan in the final. Writing for The Guardian , Dileep Premachandran suggested that the competition's success meant that "the format is here to stay". [12] The next tournament was scheduled for 2009, and it was decided that they would take place biannually (more frequently than the 50 over Cricket World Cup , which occurs once every four years). [13] In the opening match of the 2007 World Twenty20, Chris Gayle scored the first century in a T20I , the achievement being reached in the twentieth match of the format. [14]
Teams with T20I status[ edit ]
The ten Test-playing nations (which are also the ten full members of the ICC) have permanent T20I status. The nations are listed below with the date of each nation's T20I debut shown in brackets:

Finally West Indies managed to put together the kind of cluster of performances they have been missing, and hence losing matches - often from positions from where they could have won. Today, though, they didn't relent despite a poor start, and registered a welcome win albeit after the series was lost. Lendl Simmons got his sixth fifty in his last eight innings, Kieron Pollard notched up his personal best against a Test-playing nation, Carlton Baugh again played the support role before taking the lead behind the stumps, Andre Russell smacked 25 off 14 before unsettling India with his bouncers, and Darren Sam, Dilshan brings his tally of 150+ scores in ODIs to 3 and comes second to Sanath Jayasuriya in achieving the most 150+ ODI scores. Where Sanath has recorded 4 150+ scored in One-Day Internationals. Also, during his innings of 161*, he shared a 206* run second wicket partnership with Kumar Sangakkara . [35] This was the highest second wicket partnership for Sri Lanka in ODIs, but was surpassed in the following match between Sri Lanka and England by a 212* run stand between Sangakkara and Lahiru Thirimanne . [36]
On 1 March 2015, during the world cup group match against England, Dilshan took his 100th ODI wicket by dismissing Gary Balance off his own bowling, thus becoming the 3rd Sri Lankan to score 3000 runs and taking 100 wickets after Jayasuriya and Aravinda. [37]
In the same World Cup, during a group match against Australia, Dilshan smashed 24 runs off a Mitchell Johnson over, scoring six consecutive 4s, a first in World Cup history. [38]
After the loss to South Africa on 18 March 2015, in the quarter finals of World Cup, Sangakkara and Mahela retired from the ODI cricket. When asked the same question from Dilshan concerning his retirement, Dilshan stated that until Sri Lanka found a good opening bastman he will continue to feature in the shorter forms of the game about 2 years or so. Dilshan got out without scoring in the quarter finals and Sri Lanka exited a World Cup the first time without at least making the semi finals since 2003.
On 26 July 2015, Dilshan passed 10,000 ODI runs during the fifth ODI against Pakistan at Hambantota. With this, he became the fourth Sri Lankan and eleventh overall to achieve the milestone. [3]
Since the age of 35, only two cricketers have scored more than 4000 ODI runs. They are Sanath Jayasuriya and Tillakaratne Dilshan. Dilshan is the highest run scorer after reaching the age of 35 currently with 4,391 ODI runs. Jayasuriya has scored 4,142 runs. [39]
On 9 November 2015, Dilshan became the highest run scorer for Sri Lanka in Twenty20 Internationals passing 1,493 runs of Mahela Jayawardena . With this feat, Dilshan also became the first Sri Lankan and third overall to pass 1,500 T20I runs, milestone achieved after Brendan McCullum , and JP Duminy . Currently he is only behind McCullum by runs in T20Is. [40] [41] [42] [43]
Beyond Cricket[ edit ]
On 1 August 2015, Dilshan and fellow Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan were appointed as the brand ambassadors for the Presidential Task Force to combat kidney disease by the President Maithripala Sirisena . [44] [45]
Politics[ edit ]
Dilshan publicly displayed his support to Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2015 Presidential Election which has received severe criticism from some of his fans. He did so by welcoming Mahinda Rajapakse to Maharagama for an election rally. [46]

Separamadu Lasith Malinga ( Sinhalese : සපරමාදු ලසිත් මාලිංග; born 28 August 1983), in Galle , popularly as Lasith Malinga, is a Sri Lankan cricketer and World T20 winning captain in 2014. [1] Probably one of the best bowlers in the current world of cricket, Malinga is a specialist fast bowler with a unique round-arm action, sometimes referred to as a sling action, which leads to his nickname, "Slinga Malinga" and conversely, his bowling style being nicknamed "Malinga the Slinga" both terms still consistently being associated with him in street cricket and general cricketing society. [2]
He is known for his ability to take consecutive wickets, with in-swinging death yorkers : he is the only bowler in the world to have two World Cup hat-tricks, the only bowler to have taken three hat-tricks in ODIs and the only player to have taken four wickets in four consecutive balls in any form of international cricket. [3] On 22 April 2011, he announced his retirement from Test cricket . He bowls around a speed of 140 km/h (87 mph). His fastest ball was clocked at 155.7 km/h (96.8 mph) in 2011, which is still tied for the 4th fastest speed amongst active bowlers (shared with Dale Steyn )as of 3 January, 2015. [4]
His ODI and T20 bowling average and economy rate are amongst the best in the game.[ citation needed ] He is known for his ability to bowl yorkers and slower bowls to restrict scoring in the later overs of games. He is the highest wicket taker in all Twenty20 cricket and highest wicket taker for Sri Lanka in Twenty20 Internationals as well.
Malinga was the captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and was part of the team that made the final of 2007 Cricket World Cup , 2011 Cricket World Cup , 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and 2012 ICC World Twenty20 .

School career[ edit ]
Thirimanne began his cricketing career at S.Thomas' College, Bandarawela and played Under 11 cricket and his first coach was Sujeewa Gunarathne. He studied at S.Thomas' College Bandarawela initially as his father, who was employed at the Survey Department was transferred. After passing the grade 5 scholarship exam Lahiru joined Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa and played in the Under 13,15,17 and 19 team.
International career[ edit ]
He made his One Day International (ODI) debut in early 2010. [1] He made his Test debut against England at the Rose Bowl my and Anthony Martin backed up expertly with their bowling, scalping six under-pressure batsmen between them.
Smart Stats
The 103-run win is West Indies' third-highest margin of victory over India in ODIs. The highest is the 135-run win in Vijayawada in 2002.
The 146 is India's sixth-lowest score against West Indies overall and their second lowest in the West Indies.
India's 146 is their fifth-lowest score in ODIs since the beginning of 2008 . Their lowest in the same period is 88 against Sri Lanka in Dambulla in 2008.
The 96-run stand between Carlton Baugh and Kieron Pollard is the second-highest for the sixth wicket for West Indies in ODIs against India after the 118-run stand between Ricardo Powell and Nehemiah Perry in Singapore in 1999.
Pollard's 70 is his fourth half-century and second-highest score in ODIs . His highest is the 94 against Ireland in the 2011 World Cup.
Anthony Martin's 4 for 36 is fourth on the list of best bowling performances by a West Indies bowler against India in ODIs since 2005. In the same period, Ravi Rampaul's 5 for 51 in Chennai is the best.
It was never going to be an easy win. Not with Praveen Kumar and Amit Mishra in the kind of form they've been in. The two bowled six maiden overs and took five wickets between them to undo Simmons' good work. Simmons brought West Indies back from 41 for 2 through a counter-attack on the returning Ishant Sharma and on the dominant Mishra. However, he saw his partner in recovery, Darren Bravo, pick out one of three fielders on the leg-side boundary to send West Indies into a tailspin that stopped with Simmons' run-out to make it 103 for 5 in the 27th over.
This was Simmons' ninth innings out of 27 that ended between 40 and 77, a trend that flatters and then deceives. However, another flatterer-and-deceiver forgot the deceiving part today. Pollard played one of his more responsible international innings to pull West Indies out of trouble.
After an edgy start, Pollard showed much better discretion and cricketing sense. Hitting Manoj Tiwary for a straight six and a four in the 32nd over, he reached 19 off 19, and started working the singles. Baugh reciprocated just like he had done with Russell two days ago. There was a moment when Baugh should have been run out for 17, running casually with his bat in the air, but the umpire chose not to look at the replays. That was not the first mistake Norman Malcolm made, nor was it the last. His lbw call against Marlon Samuels was dodgy, as were a couple of wides, and he would go on to deny India another run-out in the last over of the innings.
Pollard, meanwhile, was making all the right decisions. The big shots and the singles were mixed well. There was also a deft late-cut, and the big hits were aimed only down the ground. Nor was there any urge to hit every delivery into the stands. He went after Mishra only when he bowled flat. He contributed 64 to the 96-run stand. Having put India under pressure, Pollard holed out in the first over of the batting Powerplay that begun in the 44th over.
That didn't stall the momentum, though, as Russell continued with his clean big striking, hitting three fours and a six to help West Indies get 57 in the Powerplay. Having reached their best score of the season, West Indies were aggressive in defence. The pitch wasn't as slow as the ones in the earlier matches, and Kemar Roach and Russell didn't bother about keeping some in the tank. They went all out against the inexperienced top order, and Sammy was canny from the other end.
India's slide began with Tiwary, who was jetlagged on debut when his stumps were clattered by Brett Lee and was now playing his comeback match as an opener, a role he is not accustomed to. It showed as he struggled against the moving ball. Nerves were on display too. He almost ran himself out and was dropped off Roach before finally edging Sammy. Parthiv Patel pulled, flicked and upper-cut well in scoring 26 of the 41 runs that came while he was at the crease. Sammy, though, got rid of him with a smart one-handed return catch to his left.
S Badrinath was then pinged by Russell's bouncers. There was an air of helplessness in the way he moved about the crease, trying to get out of the way, looking for the upper-cut. The struggle finally ended when he gloved a hook and was quick in rushing off the field.
Martin, who is a firefighter in Antigua, then came on to give his full-time job a bad name. Here were India facing the heat, and the fireman stoked the fire by scalping India's best batsman, Virat Kohli, in his first over and the innings' 21st. Baugh, who had taken an overhead catch behind his body to send Badrinath back, now finished a flashy stumping as Kohli overbalanced for a split-second. Under pressure, Suresh Raina looked for release, but slogged Martin straight to midwicket to make it 111 for 5.
Yusuf Pathan soon did something similar to Simmons, but there was still one man West Indies needed to see the back of. Rohit Sharma had denied them on two previous occasions in this series, but this time he top-edged a slog-sweep off Martin after having looked good for 39 off 47. Game over.

(born 6 December 1985 in India [1] ) is a left arm fast-medium bowler who has represented India in Test , One Day International and Twenty20 International cricket.
He first came in contention during the under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2004, when he took eight wickets for a very impressive average of 24.75. He later performed consistently in the Ranji Trophy for Uttar Pradesh and impressive performances saw him earn a place in the ODI side in 2005. In 2015, he has switched from UP to Gujarat in domestic circuit and currently representing Gujarat in Ranji Trophy.
In his third one-day match, Singh got his first man of the match award as he played his part as India restricted Sri Lanka to a modest 196 all out. Swinging the ball on a batting wicket, he took 4 important wickets to rattle Sri Lanka. His bowling figures of 8.5 overs, 2 maidens, 35 runs and 4 wickets announced his arrival on the international stage. Singh was selected to make his Test debut in the 2nd Test against Pakistan in Faisalabad , Pakistan in January 2006. He won the man of the match award on his debut after taking 5 wickets in the match.
Singh's 4 wicket-haul in the fourth match of the one-day series against Pakistan in 2006, helped India take an unassailable 3–1 lead in the series, and won him the man of the match award. India went on to win the series 4–1. In his first 11 ODI matches, he was awarded the man of the match award 3 times.
Singh was favoured to Sreesanth for the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy due to his superior economy rate. However, he was unable to maintain his level of performance, and was dropped from the side.
In 2006 it was announced that Singh would be signing for English side Leicestershire as their second overseas signing. He was however unexpectedly recalled to the Indian side following their poor World Cup campaign and only made a handful of appearances.
Singh was included in the Test squad for the tour to England and performed well, taking 5/59 at Lord's his first five-wicket-haul in Tests. In the one-day series he took seven wickets at 31.71 from five matches.
Singh was selected to play in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa in September 2007. Singh emerged as the second-highest wicket-taker in the entire competition, taking 12 wickets in 7 matches at an average of 12.66 runs per wicket.

After missing the second Test he returned for the third, but was injured midway through the match and was forced to return home.

Early history[ edit ]
The stadium is the brainchild of the late Sri Lankan president Ranasinghe Premadasa , who championed the development of this 40,000-seater concrete bowl, the biggest stadium in Sri Lanka. Opened on 2 February 1986 with a match between a Sri Lanka 'B' side and an England 'B' team, the stadium was built on swampland previously used by monks ferrying across to the Khettarama temple adjacent to it.
Ground history[ edit ]
The inaugural One Day International was played on 9 March 1986, Sri Lanka v Pakistan . On 28 August 1992 it hosted its inaugural Test match between Sri Lanka and Australia . The venue is best remembered for holding the world record for the highest Test total – 952/6 declared by Sri Lanka against India in 1997/1998 in which former Sri Lanka captain Sanath Jayasuriya scored 340 and Roshan Mahanama 225, the pair sharing a partnership 576 for the second wicket, at that time it was the highest for any wicket in a Test Match. In 10 February 2009 it hosted inaugural T20i match between Sri Lanka & India as well as 1st T20i to be played in Sri Lanka.

Renovation[ edit ]
The Premadasa Stadium underwent a reconstruction project in preparation for the 2011 Cricket World Cup . The stadium has been undergoing large-scale renovations since 2009. It has had its seating capacity increase from 14,000 to 40,000, the media-box accommodating 200 journalists, and other upgrades. The renovations have cost Sri Lanka Cricket $8 million. [3]
In July 2010, a report filed by the ICC pitch consultant, Andy Atkinson, raised concerns over the condition of the outfield and the pitch claiming he was worried at the slow pace of progress. [4] Although none of the buildings at the stadium were near completion, the 2nd Test of the West Indies tour of Sri Lanka in 2010, was held at the venue in 23–27 November. Sri Lanka Cricket defended choosing the stadium saying that the decision to stage a game was to allow cricketers to acclimatize themselves to the ground ahead of the World Cup games. [5] The Test match was staged using temporary seating for spectators in a corner of the stadium as only players' pavilions had permanent arrangements. Since the press box was not completed reporters and commentators facing technical difficulties used a makeshift arrangement.
Renovated Pavilion B
The main four public stands were refurbished along with the player dressing room area and the corporate boxes. A VIP car park is in the northern end of the ground.
Stadium plan[ edit ]
Current stands at R. Premadasa.
Pavilions A and B are fully equipped with seating in two tiers, lower and higher. Several corporate boxes are built in these two stands.

Early life[ edit ]
Unmukt Chand is an Indian cricketer who was born in Kumaoni Rajput family to Bharat Chand Thakur and Rajeshwari Chand, who are teachers. [3]
Unmukt shifted to Modern School, Barakhamba Road, in the 9th standard, getting admission in this prestigious school on the basis of his excellent performance in studies, in the written test and his skills in swimming. [4]
Early career[ edit ]
Unmukt Chand scored 435 runs during his first stint with the Delhi U-19 team. The 435 runs include 2 centuries and 1 half-century. His outstanding performance in the U-19, gave him a place in the Delhi senior team . He scored 151 runs on a seaming track against a seasoned Railways attack in Ranji Trophy 2010-11 . That year he also scored two half-centuries against Assam and Saurashtra . In fact, he scored 400 runs for Delhi ite in 2002 was the 22 ball half-century against Kenya in Bloemfontein , tying the second fastest 50 by an Indian. Because of his attacking cricket stroke plays, Sehwag has got many fans, including the WestIndies legend Desmond Haynes, who admitted that he is a great fan of him. [27]
With Ganguly's injury in the India-England ODI Series in January 2002, Sehwag received another opportunity to open the innings which he seized by scoring 82 from 64 balls in Kanpur in an eight-wicket Indian victory. [28] With good performances as opener, Sehwag was made a permanent fixture at the top of the innings. Sachin Tendulkar , who opened in the England ODI series, was moved to middle order [29] – a strategy that reaped dividends for India in 2002 in ODI matches. In the England series and the preceding tour to South Africa, he compiled 426 runs at 42.6 with four half-centuries [4] .
After modest returns on the tours of the West Indies and England in early and mid-2002, he scored 271 runs at 90.33 in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka, with two man of the match performances. After running out Ian Blackwell , he was involved in a 192 run partnership with Ganguly, scoring 126 from 104 balls to help set up an eight wicket victory against England in a group match. [30] He then scored 58 from 54 balls and took 3/25 including two wickets in the final over to help defeat South Africa by 10 runs [31] to help India progress to the final.
In late 2002 he scored an unbeaten 114 from 82 balls that included a 196 run partnership with Ganguly to lead India to a nine wicket win over the West Indies in Rajkot . [32] He was the only batsman to score a century in the 7 match New Zealand ODI Series where he made two centuries – 108 in Napier [33] in an Indian defeat and 112 in Auckland [34] in a one-wicket victory.
Virender Sehwag had a mediocre 2003 Cricket World Cup , scoring 299 runs at an average of 27, he top scored with 82 in the loss against Australia in the final. [35]
Sehwag waits at the bowler's end.
Later in 2003, he scored his fourth century and earned Man of the Match award against New Zealand in Hyderabad , scoring 130 and putting on a 182 run partnership with Tendulkar, to lay the foundations for a 145 run victory. [36] In spite of it, Sehwag struggled for consistency in 2003 and 2003/04 ODI series where he had only one century and 3 fifties, two against minnows – Bangladesh and Zimbabwe and one against Pakistan , in 22 matches.
Even with his inconsistent form, he earned 3 MoM awards in 2004/5 and 2004/05 ODI season with one award each against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan. In the match against Pakistan in Kochi he scored 108 off 95 balls, his first century in eighteen months which set up a 95 run victory. [37]
Sehwag then started a two-year streak without a century in ODIs, as well as having his ODI tour of Pakistan in early 2006 curtailed due to a shoulder injury. [38] His drought in limited overs cricket has puzzled cricket experts because of the consistent performances in Test matches with a high scoring rate has not translated into significant contributions in the ODI format of the game. [39] Sehwag was dropped from the ODI Squad for the WI-IND 4 Match ODI series . With debate over whether he deserved to be included in the 2007 Cricket World Cup squad, captain Dravid's insistence on his retention paved the way to being named in the World Cup squad. [40] However, despite this assurance, Sehwag's form continued to decline.
Sehwag started the 2007 World Cup in poor form, only being picked for the side because of Rahul Dravid's wishes. He scored poorly in the first group match but bounced back to hit a magnificent 114 from 87 deliveries against lowly ranked Bermuda. The Indian team scored 413–5, the highest team total in a World Cup match, and went on to win the match but this was their only win in the tournament.
On 11 March 2009, Sehwag blasted India's fastest ODI hundred against New Zealand by reaching 3 figures in just 60 balls. Eventually, he led India to win its first series win in New Zealand.
On 8 December 2011, Sehwag scored his highest ODI score against West Indies at Indore slamming 219 runs off only 149 Balls. In the same innings, he also crossed 8,000 runs in ODI Cricket. [41]
ODI summary
Sehwag's scoring rate is extremely quick, at 103.44 runs per 100 balls (it is exceeded only by one current player: Shahid Afridi, who has a much lower average). He has had more success in run chases, scoring seven of his thirteen centuries while chasing. He has led India on seven occasions, due to the unavailability of the incumbent due to illness, injury or rotation policy. In December 2011 Sehwag scored 219 in 149 deliveries against West Indies at Indore . He has the record of 2nd highest individual score in ODI . [8]
Test career
An innings-by-innings breakdown of Sehwag's Test match batting career, showing runs scored (red bars) and the average of the last ten innings (blue line).
Sehwag's maiden century in mid-2001 in Sri Lanka was not enough to gain selection in the Test team for the corresponding series. [42] Sehwag made his Test debut in late 2001 in the First Test against South Africa in Bloemfontein as a middle-order batsman. He scored 105 on debut despite the South African win. [43] He was given a one match suspension by ICC match referee Mike Denness for overappealing [44] in the Second Test in Port Elizabeth , which led to political dispute amongst the ICC and the two countries. He returned for the home series in 2001–02 against England and Zimbabwe . After scoring two half-centuries in the preceding series, he was promoted to a makeshift-opener on the 2002 England tour after the failure of previous openers and an experiment with wicket-keeper Deep Dasgupta . He scored 84 in the new role at Lord's [45] and then a century in the Second Test at Trent Bridge , [46] and has batted there in Test matches ever since. He scored his maiden home-century of 147 in the First Test against the West Indies in the 2002–03 home season in Mumbai , which was at the time his top score in Test matches, earning him his first man of the match award.

In early 2004, he became the only Indian to score a triple century in Test cricket, with 309 against Pakistan in the First Test in Multan , beating V. V. S. Laxman 's previous Indian record(281 against Australia) and helping India to a total of 5/675, the highest ever against Pakistan. It was Sehwag's sixth Test century in 21 Tests. [52] [53] India went on to win by an innings, with Sehwag named man of the match. [54] He also scored 90 in the Second Test defeat in Lahore [55] and was named man of the series for his efforts after being the highest run scorer and average for the series. [56] [57] He later auctioned the bat with which he made the triple century, for Rs. 70,000, to aid in relief efforts for the tsunami victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake . [58]

International debut[ edit ]
Kulasekera made his One Day International debut against England at Dambulla on 18 November 2003. He took 2–19 as England were bowled out for 88, and Sri Lanka took less than 14 overs to win by 10 wickets.
He made his Test cricket debut against New Zealand at Napier on 4 April 2005. He took only one wicket, and scored a duck, as the match was drawn.
IPL 2011[ edit ]
Kulasekara joined the Chennai Super Kings for a price of $100,000 to play for their team in the IPL 2011.
Bowling style[ edit ]
Kulasekara, who hustles in from a long run – up, has a lovely smooth action which helps him to hurl the ball at a lively pace, getting enough seam movement both ways to trouble the batsman . He skills lie in his ability to produce inswing and he is well known for his moderate nature to the batsmen, seldom being overly aggressive. He is regarded as one of the best swing bowlers currently playing cricket.
Break through[ edit ]
He came of age in the year 2008, when he took 47 wickets – which propelled him to the top spot in the ICC ODI rankings for bowlers. The retirement of Chaminda Vaas and the inconsistency of Lasith Malinga proved to be a boon for Kulasekara as he leapfrogged them to emerge as the strike bowler of the Lankan side.
He scored his first Test fifty against England in the 1st Test at Lord's in May 2006, batting out much of the fifth day to save the match.
He was the No. 1 ranked ODI bowler for a few months in 2009 when he reached his highest ratings (727).
He is currently ranked in sixth place of bowling both in the world ODI and T20I formats due to his ability to swing the ball both in and out.
He picked up his first five wicket haul in 3rd ODI against Australia at Brisbane on 18 January 2013. He recorded his best bowling figures 5/22 in this match.
Batting[ edit ]
Kulasekara has often played some late order cameos in the shorter format of the game and employs a daring approach with the willow at the crease. A sturdy batsman, he has proved to be quite a tough man to dislodge in the Test format . In ODI's, he is occasionally sent in as a pinch hitter for Sri Lanka, notably with a score of 58* in the 2013 Champions Trophy to assist Kumar Sangakkara in beating England, in the second group game.

[3] [4] He has had his basic education at St Anthony's College at Kadalana in his village where there were no facilities at all for sports. He subsequently entered Moratuwa Maha Vidyalaya in the year of 2000. During a cricket coaching class, Mendis' talents were initially identified by the school coach named Mr Lucky Rogers back in the year 1998 when he was just 13 years of age. In the year 2000 he represented the school under 15 cricket team and he was selected to the first eleven team. He also deputised for the school team captain. This slow medium bowler with a variation of leg spin was adjudged the Best Bowler at the big-matches twice in 2001 and 2002.
Military career[ edit ]
Sri Lanka Artillery Cricket Committee noticed his talents when he played a cricket match against the Army under 23 Division 11 during 2003/2004 tournaments. Following this he was invited to enlist in the regular force of the Sri Lanka Army , this was particularly due to the low number of cricketers from Colombo schools joining the Army in the recent years. He enlisted, partly due to the reason that his father, the bread-winner for the family had died the week before due to a heart attack. [5]
Following basic training he played for the army team and saw active military service as a Gunner in the Sri Lanka Artillery , [5] a regiment of the Sri Lanka Army .

Domestic cricket[ edit ]
Mendis has represented the Army in 23 limited over matches and 59 two/three-day matches, in which he has 38 wickets and 244 wickets respectively to his credit. Mendis bowls off spin as his stock delivery and he has few more variations in his armoury- leg spin, top spin and faster bowl. All this was developed during 2006/2007 domestic seasons on his own. He also extended his purple patch in the domestic season 2007/2008 under 23 division 1 tournament and was later selected to the pool of "Academy Squad" organised by Sri Lanka Cricket. There he was able to polish his cricketing skills further. He had the opportunity of touring neighbouring India on an eight-day tour in June 2007 where he was given the opportunity to play two, two-day matches. In the meantime, Sri Lanka Cricket selectors could not ignore his performance in the Premier Limited Over Tournament 2007/2008 and got him selected to play in the "Ptershire . Captaining WA and Worcester to various trophies, Moody, an aggressive and fast scoring batsman, scored over 20,000 first class runs and hit 64 centuries; he was also a useful medium pace bowler. His 1,387 List A runs for Worcestershire in 1991 is a record for the county. [1]
He played eight Test matches for Australia between 1989 and 1992, although he had more success with Australia's one-day team, appearing in three World Cups and two finals – 1987 and 1999 – alongside Steve Waugh . He was even more successful when he threw a haggis the distance of 230 feet in 1989. [2] [3]
Post-retirement[ edit ]
Since retirement in 2001, Moody has coached, been an Australian cricketer's representative and for several years held the post of director of cricket with Worcestershire. In May 2005 he was appointed coach of the Sri Lankan national team and he led them to the final of the 2007 world cup before leaving the post.
On 14 May 2007, the WACA announced Moody's appointment as manager and head coach of the Western Warriors for the next three years. Trevor Penney , England's fielding coach during the 2005 Ashes series and assistant to Moody in Sri Lanka, will join as assistant coach. [4] However Moody announced in March 2010 that he would not seek a new contract after the 2009–2010 season. Under Moody, WA qualified for one final in three seasons, in the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash , in his first season which it lost to Victoria.
He is a cricket commentator who commentates around the world as well as some Australian Test and ODI Cricket for Channel Nine and the Big Bash League for Channel Ten.

See also: Eligibility for the NBA draft
The NBA Draft, held in a New York theater each summer, is only two rounds long. Instead of automatically granting the top pick to the worst team from the year before, the NBA holds a draft lottery to determine who chooses first. The top three picks are allocated by chance among the 14 teams that did not make the playoffs the year before. This discourages a team from losing on purpose to get a better draft pick, but also causes other controversies such as allegations that the lottery is rigged.
NBA teams choose players from the NCAA and from teams overseas. It was formerly common for players to be chosen directly from high school, but in 2006, the NBA required that players wait a year after high school before playing in the NBA. Almost all top U.S. players thus play at least one year in college.
Main article: NHL Entry Draft
The NHL operates a seven-round off-season draft. Like the NBA, the NHL uses a lottery system to determine which team gets the top pick. All 14 teams that failed to qualify for the playoffs take part in the weighted lottery with the winner moving up to select first overall. Any North American player aged 18–20, and any overseas player aged 18–21 is eligible to be selected. Players are generally chosen from junior hockey teams, high schools, the NCAA and overseas clubs.
An unusual side effect of the NHL's draft is that some high-profile prospects, especially those who play through their full eligibility in U.S. college hockey, are no longer eligible for the draft by the time they enter the NHL. These players are immediately allowed to sign with any team that will take them; because the NCAA season ends shortly after the NHL's trade deadline , such players usually are signed to bolster positions that teams were unable to address through trades.
The NHL rotates the draft's location among cities with teams in the league. Like baseball, players drafted in the entry draft usually have to wait a few years in development, either in junior hockey or the minor leagues, before cracking an NHL roster; usually, only one or two draft picks, generally those that are widely predicted to be blue-chip superstars, jump directly from the draft to the NHL (e.g. Sidney Crosby or Jaromir Jagr ).
The three major junior leagues that make up the Canadian Hockey League also hold drafts of teenage players in their territories.
Main article: Major League Baseball Draft
Major League Baseball holds two drafts each year. In June, the First-Year Player Draft, MLB's entry draft, takes place. Only players from Canada, the U.S. or a U.S. territory may be drafted; players from elsewhere are free agents and can be signed by any team. Draftees are high-school graduates who have opted not to go to college; college baseball players at four-year institutions who have played three years or turned 21; or junior college baseball players. The draft lasts up to 50 rounds. The MLB Draft generally receives less attention than the drafts in other American sports, since drafted players usually spend several years in the minor leagues before they crack the Major League team's roster. Also, unlike the MLS, NFL, NBA and the NHL Drafts, the MLB Draft takes place during the season instead of in the offseason.
In December, MLB holds the much shorter Rule 5 draft . If an organization keeps a player in the minor leagues for a certain number of years, other teams can draft him in the Rule 5 draft. The drafting team must keep the player on its major-league roster; it cannot put the player in its own minor-league system.
Main article: MLS SuperDraft
Major League Soccer have 3 types of draft each year. Types of drafts include the MLS SuperDraft , the MLS Supplemental Draft and the MLS Expansion Draft .
Main article: WNBA Draft
Every spring, the WNBA Draft is held at league headquarters in Secaucus , New Jersey . From 2005 to 2008, the Draft was held in the city that hosted the NCAA Women's Final Four . The draft is currently three rounds long with each of the 12 teams in the league (trades aside) getting three picks each. Draft order for teams that made the playoffs the previous year are based on team records. The team with the highest previous record will pick last. Since eight teams qualify for playoffs , the bottom eight picks are determined by this method. For the remaining top four picks, a selection process similar to the NBA Draft Lottery is conducted for the four teams that did not qualify for the playoffs.
Main article: Canadian College Draft
The Canadian Football League holds its annual player draft before the start of the season, either in the last days of April or the start of May. It was formerly held as part of the annual league meetings in Hamilton , but is now typically held by conference call with the first two rounds being broadcast live on TSN . Since 2013 , the draft has consisted of seven rounds, with teams drafting in inverse order of their records in the previous season. As with the NFL Draft, trading of picks is very common, meaning that a team will not necessarily have seven picks in a given draft.
The draft is restricted to Canadian citizens, plus non-citizens who were raised in Crovincial Tournament 2008" representing "Wayamba Province" under the National Captain. In that tournament he performed exceptionally well with the ball. Local TV commentators predicted him as the ideal replacement for senior spinner Muttiah Muralitharan in time to come and nicknamed him as "Mysterious Bowler". His performance in the said tournament got the National Selectors to observe him further closely, after he became the most successful bowler by taking 68 wickets in nine matches which is also a record in any form of domestic cricket.
In the 2010 County Championship Mendis was to play for Hampshire as their overseas player for the season as a replacement for Imran Tahir , but he was unable to fulfill his contract and never appeared for the county.
He now, however, has confirmed that he will be playing for South West side Somerset in the upcoming 2011 English domestic season.
Bowling style[ edit ]
Mendis, although classified as slow-medium, bowls a mixture of deliveries, including googlies, off-breaks, top-spinners, flippers and leg-breaks, as well as the carrom ball , released with a flick of his middle finger. For Sri Lanka Army in 2007–08 he averaged a mere 10.56 and took 46 wickets in six games, his strike rate a startling 31. This gained him a call-up to the full Sri Lanka squad for the Caribbean tour in April 2008.
Mendis bowling
The veteran West Indies cricket writer Tony Becca wrote in the Jamaica Gleaner: "Mendis bowls everything. With a smile on his face as he caresses the ball before delivering it, he bowls the offbreak, he bowls the legbreak, he bowls the googly, he bowls the flipper, he bowls a straight delivery, he bowls them with different grips and different actions, he bowls them with a different trajectory and at a different pace, and he disguises them brilliantly. The result is that he mesmerises, or bamboozles, batsmen. [8]
Jerome Jayaratne, the Sri Lanka Cricket Academy coach, said: "Mendis is unusual, freaky and has developed a ball which he releases with a snap of his fingers ( carrom ball ), which is very unusual compared to other orthodox spin bowlers." That ball is reminiscent of the former Australia spinner Johnny Gleeson , who had a similar delivery. [9]
Although the ball can be made to either turn away or into a right-handed batsman, Mendis uses it to turn away from a right-handed batsman, to contrast it with his off-breaks and googlies. The Australian Test cricketer and coach Peter Philpott actually predicted the rise of a bowler such as Mendis in a book written in 1973. [1]
"...Eventually I see the Iverson method being best employed by an orthodox off-spinner. Instead of a basic Iverson attack with occasional orthodox off-spin, there is a great future for an accurate off-spinner who produces a difficult to detect leg spinner every now and then. I could visualise such a bowler causing great concern amongst batsmen, and young off-spinners might be well rewarded for experimentation in this field..."
Test cricket[ edit ]
Ajantha Mendis made his debut in Test cricket against India in at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground , Colombo, on 23 July 2008. He claimed his first Test wicket in his fifth over, bowling Rahul Dravid with a delivery now christened the carrom ball, that turned from middle and hit off stump. He went on to claim the wickets of Anil Kumble , Zaheer Khan & VVS Laxman to finish with figures of 4 for 72 in his maiden test bowling performance. He followed this up with 4 for 60 in India's second innings. Ajantha Mendis' match figures of 8 for 132 are the best by any Sri Lankan bowler on Test debut, bettering Kuruppurachchi's 7 for 85 against Pakistan in 1985–86. After the game Muttiah Muralitharan stated that "When I started playing Test cricket, I was not as good as Mendis. He is exceptional. He is the future of Sri Lankan cricket,". Mendis collected his first ten-wicket haul in the very next match, which Sri Lanka went on to lose. With 26 wickets (ave.18.38) in the series, Mendis has passed Alec Bedser 's world record for most wickets by a bowler on his debut in a three-Test series. [10] [11] Ajantha Mendis won the player of the series award for his efforts. On 6 August 2010 during the series against India, Mendis scored his highest Test score of 78.
One day internationals[ edit ]
Ajantha Mendis made his One Day International debut against West Indies in at the Queen's Park Oval , Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 10 April 2008. He announced his arrival on the international stage with three for 39 off 10 overs in this game, and dumbfounded the West Indian batsmen with his range of variations without a perceptible change in his action. Rob Steen summed up the impact of this initial performance by stating "I have just seen the future of spin bowling – and his name is Ajantha Mendis."
Ajantha Mendis, playing his eighth ODI, picked up the first six-wicket haul in the Asia Cup final against India in July 2008. His 6 for 13 is the third-best bowling performance in a tournament final, and the third-best for a spinner in ODIs. His 17 wickets is the best for an edition of the Asia Cup, and he bagged those wickets at an astounding average of 8.52. Ajantha Mendis won the man of the match award in the finals as well as the player of the tournament award for his efforts.
He has also broken fastest 50 wicket record in ODI, previously held by Ajit Agarkar of India for 23 matches. He broke the record by snatching 50 wickets in just 19 matches.
Mendis was not included to the 2015 Cricket World Cup team and he did not play in the other bilateral series in late 2014 to late 2015. He was included to the ODI and T20I series against West indies in October 2015. He took 2 wickets in the first ODI at R Premadasa Stadium and with these two wickets, he reached 150 ODI wickets, becoming the 8th Sri Lankan to reach that milestone. In the batting, Sri Lanka was in good position to win the game, but with the magical bowling by Sunil Narine , Sri Lanka lost 9 wickets with 21 more runs to win the game. Mendis came on to bat and scored a magnificent 21 runs, guided the team to win the match by 1 wicket. He smashed a huge six to Johnson Charles for a free hit, through long-on to reach his highest ODI score of unbeaten 21 runs. [12]
Twenty20 cricket[ edit ]
On 10 October 2008, Ajantha Mendis made his Twenty20 debut against Zimbabwe in King City, Canada. He claimed four for 15 in four overs and won the man of the match award. In the next game he took four wickets for 17 against Canada and went on to take three wickets for 23 in the four-nation series final against Pakistan, helping his side to a five-wicket win. For his remarkable performance of 11 wickets for 55 in just three games, Ajantha Mendis was adjudged the player of the series. In the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England, Mendis was the third highest wicket taker, behind Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal and Umar Gul . He was a contender for Man of the Tournament, but came third behind team mate Tillakaratne Dilshan .
Mendis has twice set, and currently holds, the record for best figures in a Twenty20 International. On 8 August 2011, he took six wickets for 16 runs in the second Twenty20 international against Australia, becoming the first bowler to take six wickets in a Twenty20 international, and surpassing Umar Gul's five wickets for six runs recorded against New Zealand in 2009. [13] The following year, on 18 September 2012 in the opening match of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 against Zimbabwe, Mendis bettered this record by taking six wickets for eight runs. Up to date, Mendis is the only bowler to take six wicket hauls in Two Twenty20 internationals. [2]
IPL[ edit ]
At the 2013 Indian Premier League Auctions held in Chennai , India on 3 February 2013, Mendis proved to be one of the most expensive players sold, purchased by the Pune Warriors India for $725,000. [14]
ICC Awards[ edit ]
On 10 September 2008, Ajantha Mendis has won the "Emerging Player of the Year" award at the ICC Awards ceremony in Dubai. Mendis was the top choice of the 25-person Voting Academy, coming in ahead of England's up-and-coming Stuart Broad, South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel and fast bowler Ishant Sharma of India.
The Emerging Player of the Year Award was one of eight individual prizes given at the 2008, ICC Awards. Players eligible for this award must be under 26 years of age at the start of the voting period (9 August 2007) and have played no more than five Test matches and/or 10 ODIs before the start of the voting period.

International career[ edit ]
Senanayake made his international debut for Sri Lanka in the fourth One Day International (ODI) of the tour of South Africa in January 2012. From then, he was a regular part of Sri Lanka's spin attack in limited over cricket with Ajantha Mendis and occasionally with Seekkuge Prasanna . After a suspect bowling action, he showed poor bowling in later bilateral tournaments. However, he was included to the 15-men 2015 ICC World Cup tournament as the main spinner of the team.
Domestic career[ edit ]
His call-up followed a domestic season in which he had taken the most wickets in the Sri Lankan Premier League limited overs tournament. [1] During the 2013 Indian Premier League auction he was bought by Kolkata Knight Riders for US$15,000.

Career[ edit ]
Prasad attended De Mazenod College in Kandana , where he started playing cricket as a top order batsman. He became a fast bowler in his late teens and played in the 2002 Under-19 World Cup . In February 2006, he was called up to Sri Lanka's ODI and Test squads for a tour of Bangladesh after bowling at an average of less than 23 runs per wicket in domestic first class cricket. [2] He made his ODI debut on the tour, taking 2/29 in a 78-run win over Bangladesh in Chittagong . [1] [3]
Dhammika Prasad getting some tips from Chaminda Vaas
Prasad's international career was subsequently affected by a back injury. He had to wait until August 2008 to make his Test debut, taking five wickets over both innings of the third Test of India's tour of Sri Lanka , including those of Sachin Tendulkar , who Prasad said was his favourite player, Rahul Dravid , and Virender Sehwag . [4] [5] He played Test cricket sporadically over the following seasons. He took four wickets in the first Test of Sri Lanka's tour of Bangladesh in December 2008, but was dropped for the second Test. [6] [7] In 2009, he played in the second Test of Sri Lanka's home series against New Zealand and the first Test of Sri Lanka's tour of India , in which he injured his hamstring. [8] In 2010, he played in one Test against India and another against the West Indies , failing to take any wickets on either occasion. [9]
In June 2011, Prasad was recalled to Sri Lanka's ODI squad for the tour of England and Scotland . [10] He played in two ODIs on the tour, taking two wickets against England and three against Scotland. [11] He was named in the Test squad for Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in August and September, but did not play. He did, however, make his international Twenty20 debut against Australia, [12] [13] before playing in two Tests of Sri Lanka's series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates . [9] He was called into Sri Lanka's squad for their tour of South Africa in 2011–12 as a replacement for injured bowlers. He played in the third and deciding Test of the series, which Sri Lanka lost, taking two wickets for 156 runs, and also played in two ODIs. [14] [15]
Prasad was selected for the 2015 Cricket World Cup original squad, but was unable play due to injury. So he was called off from the World Cup squad. [16]
After World Cup, Prasad brought back into the squad for Test series against Pakistan. In the second Test, he showed a good aggressive bowling performance where he took 3 for 43 in the first innings and then 4 for 92 in second innings. Due to Sri Lanka lost the first Test at Galle, the second Test must win to level the series. So, Prasad provided the basis for the win and he earned the man of the match award for his impressive bowling performance in the second Test at P Sara Oval . [17]
During the India Test tour in 2015, Prasad showed immense talent with the new ball, where he used to take up the wickets in very first over in each Test match getting rid of Indian top order. He was the highest wicket taker for Sri Lanka in the series with 15 wickets. But, some aggressive behaviors with Indian pacer Ishant Sharma has been given warned by ICC during the third Test. [18] [19]
Test 5 wicket hauls[ edit ]
#



He made his Test match debut for Sri Lanka against New Zealand on 26 December 2014. [3]
Kaushal made his One Day International debut for Sri Lanka against South Africa on 18 March 2015 in the quarter-finals of the 2015 Cricket World Cup . He got a chance as a replacement for the injured Rangana Herath . [4]
Kaushal replaced injured Dilruwan Perera for the second test against Pakistan . He was a real headache for the Pakistani batsmen from the very first over and finally he took his first 5-wicket haul by taking 5 for 42 runs. [5]
Kaushal's second five wicket haul came against India at Galle on 13 August 2015. Sri Lanka was in desparate trouble in the match, where their spearhead Rangana Herath along with Kaushal destroyed the India's second innings to just 112 runs. Herath took 7 wickets and Kaushal took rest of the 3 wickets. Sri Lanka finally won the match by 63 runs. [6]
Bowling action[ edit ]
Kaushal's bowling action is slightly similar to legendary fellow Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan . Instead of being usual off-spinners, Kaushal is actually a wrist spinner as Murali. After the Test series against India in 2015, his bowling action has a illegal suspect action and ICC has given a period for checking his action in Chennai. After the study, Sri Lanka's chairman of selectors Kapila Wijegunawardene stated that, the off-spin of Kaushal is legal to bowl, but not the doosra. Doosra should be inside the ICC's 15-degree limit, which is not with Kaushal. So, Kaushal is banned for bowling doosra in international level. [7]



Domestic career[ edit ]
He made his first-class debut for Sebastianites Cricket and Athletic Club in 2005. He has also represented the Sri Lankan A squad. The closest he came to national recognition was when he was included in the 30-member provisional squad for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England, but he was left out of the final 15 squad. That call-up came close on the heels of his maiden first-class ton, 135 for Basnahira South against Ruhuna Royals in the SLC Inter-Provincial Tournament, a match in which he also claimed five wickets. In 2012, Milinda went over to England to become Bury CC's professional for the 2012 season but his stay was cut short as he was selected to play in the Sri Lanka Premin five Ranji matches. He has participated in Vinoo Mankad Trophy and the Coach Behar Trophy at the junior level.
Captaincy[ edit ]
Unmukt Chand was named the captain of the Delhi U-19 team [5] and the North Zone U-19 team. He then went on to become the captain of the India Under-19 cricket team for the quadrangular series that was held in Vishakhapatnam , India. The quadrangular series included U-19 teams from India, Sri Lanka , West Indies and Australia . He scored an unbeaten 122 against Sri Lanka and two fifties against Australia and West Indies. [6] He ended the tournament with 336 runs from seven outings, just one behind Australia’s Cam Bancroft . He also participated in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy later that season. In his captaincy India also won the U-19 World cup in Australia.
Big-match player[ edit ]
In April 2012, India U-19 cricket team played a quadrangular series in Australia involving U-19 teams from Australia, England and New Zealand . Batting at 3, Chand scored an impressive 94 against England in the semi-final to help India win the match by 63 runs. He followed it up with a blistering century against Australia in the final – an unbeaten 112, which included 9 fours and 6 sixes – to take India to an emphatic 7-wicket victory. India won the tournament under Chand's captaincy, who ended with 281 runs from 5 matches, only six runs short of the tournament's highest run-getter Daniel Bell-Drummond .
In June 2012, in the ACC Under-19s Asia Cup, Chand rose to the occasion once again with a 116 against Sri Lanka in the semi-final before scoring 121 against Pakistan in the final. He won the Man of the match award in both the games. He was the highest run-getter in the tournament with 286 runs from 3 matches.
On 26 August 2012, Chand led the India U-19s to victory in the 2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup in Australia. India defeated Australia in the final to lift the World Cup, with Chand scoring a captain's knock of 111* in 130 balls which consisted of 6 sixes and 7 fours. [7]
On 3 March 2013, Chand scored 116 for Delhi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy final against Assam to show his penchant for scoring hundreds in tournament finals. Delhi went on to win the game by 95 runs and the title for the first time.
IPL career[ edit ]
Unmukt made his IPL debut for Delhi Daredevils in 2011. He continued to play for them in IPL 6 too. His performances however are nowhere near his match-winning performances for India U19 in the World Cup and he was dropped for the last game against Sunrisers Hyderabad. He's played a total of 7 matches scoring only 61 runs in total.He has been bought by the Rajasthan Royals for Rs 65 lakhs during the IPL 7 Auction. He was picked for the Mumbai Indians in the 2015 season and spent most of the season on the sidelines due to indifferent performances. [8]

India in West Indies 2011 June 3, 2011
Tide is high for India's young and restless
There has been no other recent Indian team with players as desperate to prove a point and stake a claim as this one
  shares 31

There must be a big balloon of gloom descending on the television companies broadcasting India's tour of West Indies. How do you hype a series featuring an Indian team lacking its big stars and an opposition adamant about not including its star player(s)?  The TV pundits always find an answer. This is being billed as a sign of the future. And this time, in the context of at least the Indian players, they may even be right.
There has been no recent Indian team with so many players so desperate to prove a point and stake a claim as this one. Until this series, the recent India story was about the ambitious march of a team to the top of the ladder: a Test series win in New Zealand, a series-levelling effort in South Africa, a World Cup triumph. This series against West Indies is about the young and the restless India. It's about assessing the hunger and the talent in these men. There are quite a few players at an almost vital crossroads in their career.
Leading them is a man who encompasses so much about this brave new talented India, but Suresh Raina comes with qualifications: "There is talent but …" When the triumvirate of Tendulkar, Laxman and Dravid eventually go, can the Rainas of India fill that gaping hole?
For long Raina has been the antithesis of Rohit Sharma. Not many have criticised Raina's "attitude"; in fact Rahul Dravid hailed him as among the more hardworking youngsters he's seen in recent times.  His short-ball woes put him in danger of being labelled as an ODI player, though. In that respect he is treading the path of Michael Bevan. While Raina would probably give a leg to own Bevan's ODI record, he will dread going Bevan's way in Tests.  Bevan's Test career was derailed by his problems against the short ball and Raina has to do something very quickly if he wants to avert similar free fall.
For long Virat Kohli had been oscillating between Rohit and Raina. Attitude problems dogged him but he, like Raina, seemed determined to get himself out of the doghouse. Slowly, step by step, he has erased almost all his blots. His game has improved considerably and on current form he appears the best of the younger lot to seize a middle-order spot in Tests. And if Raina slips up, Kohli could well pounce on the captaincy as well.
For long Rohit Sharma has been the antithesis of S Badrinath. Opportunity and fame threatened to get the better of him and he wasn't perhaps mentally equipped to deal with them. Critics singled out his lack of hunger. No one raised a word about his talent despite his playing 61 ODIs for a below-par average of 27.13. His fans have pointed to this year's IPL to show the winds of change are blowing; that he looks fitter, hungrier and has mended his ways. This series will be the chance for him to offer some definitive proof.
For long S Badrinath has been ploughing a lone field in the domestic dust bowls. Anonymity is a luxurious cloak that superstars seek; Badrinath wants to be recognised. For him the IPL wasn't about money, it wasn't about thrilling the crowds; it was about the basic human urge to get recognised and find a tiny spot on the global cricket map. "When people say, 'that shot off Lee was good,' it's a little bit of recognition, and it's a little bit of happiness that gives you satisfaction," Badrinath said about playing in the IPL.
For long Sreesanth has been waging a battle against himself; he has been the biggest ever reality show featuring an Indian cricketer. His path to manhood played out on big flat plasma screens to billions of fans. Again, like Rohit, his talent has been scarcely questioned but everyone and his uncle have been hammering on his temperament.
For long Ishant Sharma has been living off that one demonic spell against Ricky Ponting. Unlike Sreesanth or Rohit, his attitude has never been questioned. Venkatesh Prasad, the former bowling coach, even nominated him as the most disciplined and hardworking aspirant. Perhaps, in his case, he tried too much. The left shoulder collapsed, the follow-through became a stutter, the wrists weren't behind the seam and the Indian fans were aghast and wary of another talent going the way of Irfan Pathan. Luckily, things seem to be on the mend; the IPL offered brief glimpses of a positive change.
For long Murali Vijay has flattered to deceive. He looks a million bucks when he plays one of his flamboyant on-the-up shots but leaves you tearing your hair when he mis-hits one to a fielder.  And yet this is the same player who showed such restraint and sense of occasion on his debut Test against Australia, in which he rarely played a false shot. If he can marry that kind of discipline with his talent, he can progress. However, the jury is still out on his skill on tough pitches. It's not to say that he doesn't have the talent to cope, but that he hasn't been tested yet.
The West Indies is a place where even angels can be tempted to stray. It's here that the young and restless India will beer League .
On 11 July 2015, Milinda made his One Day International (ODI) debut at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in the ODI series against Pakistan . [1]
He scored his first ODI fifty in the fifth ODI in Pakistan series, where him with skipper Angelo Mathews had a unbeaten partnership of 114 runs. Sri Lanka posted their highest ever ODI total against Pakistan by scoring 368/4 in 50 overs.
He made his Twenty20 International debut for Sri Lanka against Pakistan on 30 July 2015. He was the highest run scorer for Sri Lanka in that match, where he had quick 35 runs, until he gets caught. Sri Lanka eventually lost the match at the end. His first T20 international wicket came on second match of the series, where he took the wicket of Shoaib Malik . [2]
Milinda made his Test debut on 14 October 2015, against the West Indies . [3] Before gaining the Test cap, he scored a unbeaten century in the three-day practice match against the same side. [4]
In the second match of the series, Milinda top scored valuable 68 runs where Sri Lanka were all out for 200 runs in first innings. He showed a good talent with the ball, where he took 2 wickets for 25 runs and with the help of pacer Dhammika Prasad , who got 4 wickets, Windies were all out for 163. In the second innings, Milinda again scored quick 42 runs, just lost his maiden Test fifty. As Sri Lanka only scored 206 runs, Windies only required 244 runs to win the match and level the series. They were at good position to win the game with 1 for 81 runs, Milinda strikes and broke the partnership. West Indies could not come back and Sri Lanka finally won the match by 72 runs and won the series as well. Milinda took his best bowling figures by getting 3 for 25 runs and due to his allround performance, he adjudged man of the match as well. [5]

Early life[ edit ]
Upul Tharanga had his education at Dharmasoka College , Ambalangoda . He started his cricket career as a teenager at his school. Having played for Nondescripts since the age of 15, he played for Sri Lanka's under-15, under-17 and under-19 squads. He had a successful under-19 World Cup in 2004 with successful innings of 117 and 61 in successive games. He was sent by the Sri Lankan cricketing board to play league cricket for Loughton Cricket Club in Essex.
Tharanga's Sri Lankan call-up in July 2005 made for a mixed 2005, after his family home was washed away by the Asian tsunami . His equipment, which was also washed away, was replaced by Kumar Sangakkara . Tharanga graduated to the "A" team and in July he was selected for the full squad.
International career[ edit ]
On the 2006 tour of England he really began to develop, particularly in the one-day game, scoring over 300 runs in Sri Lanka's 5–0 whitewash of the hosts. In addition, Tharanga is also well known for taking part in a record-breaking first wicket partnership with Sanath Jayasuriya in the final match of this series. He finished off with 109 off 102 balls, and played a pivotal role in completing the whitewash against England.
Tharanga lost his form in the 2007 World Cup scoring only one half century (against New Zealand) he then continued his poor run of form in the home series against England in 2007 where he failed to contribute and often fell before the 10th over often resulting in a middle-order collapse. Subsequently he lost his ODI place to Malinda Warnapura and his test place to Michael Vandort but he remains within the squad.
However, in the 2011 World Cup, he is back to performing remarkably. In the quarter-final game against England, his partnership with Dilshan could not be pierced. Together they wrapped up the game, each acquiring centuries. His strong form has returned him to the opening position in the strong Sri-Lankan batting line up.
He has also come in for special praise from Jayasuriya , one of the greats of cricket, saying that he could be the next captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team.
Upul Tharanga is the second batsman in the world who was involved with 7 times 200+ partnerships in ODI cricket. The only other player to achieve this feat is Ricky Ponting . [1]
On 2 July 2013, Upul Tharanga scored the second highest ODI score of 174* by a Sri Lankan only behind Sanath Jayasuriya who scored 189 against India. With that innings he became the 9th Sri Lankan player to pass 5000 runs margin. Despite of his low match participation, he has earned 13 centuries and 11 man of the match titles for his name throughout his international career.
After 8 years of scarcity for Test cricket, Tharanga was called to the third Test match against Pakistan in 3 July 2015. He was used as the replacement for Kumar Sangakkara who did play for first two Tests, but not to third Test at Kandy , due to his retirement consideration during India tour . [2] He scored 46 runs in the first innings and 48 in the second innings. However, Sri Lanka lost the series by 2-1.
Tharanga, who had a long ODI scarcity, was included to the ODI squad against Pakistan. Due to the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara , the number three position had a vacant and Sri Lanka cricket selected Tharanga for the crucial number three position in ODIs.

List of One Day International cricket records

Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run-scorer and century maker in ODI cricket
Muttiah Muralitharan is the highest wicket-taker in ODI cricket
One Day International (ODI) cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) as well as the top six Associate and Affiliate members . [1] Unlike Test matches , ODIs consist of one innings per team, having a limit in the number of overs . The limit of overs is currently 50 overs per innings, although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs. [2] ODI cricket is List-A cricket , so statistics and records set in ODI matches also count toward List-A records. The earliest match now recognised as an ODI was played between England and Australia in January 1971; [3] since then there have been over 3,000 ODIs played by 26 teams. The frequency of matches has steadily increased, partly because of the increase in the number of ODI-playing countries, and partly as the cricket boards of those nations seek to maximise their revenue. [4]
The most successful team in ODI cricket, in terms of win percentage, barring the Asia XI cricket team , [5] is Australia , having won 527 of their 854 ODIs (64.58%). In contrast, four teams have failed to win a single ODI: East Africa , Hong Kong , Namibia , and the USA . [6] Notable ODI records include longest winning sequence (Australia, 21), longest losing sequence (Bangladesh, 23), highest individual score (Rohit Sharma, 264), best bowling figures (Chaminda Vaas, 8–19), most runs in an over (Herschelle Gibbs, 36) and fastest century (AB De Villiers, 31 deliveries [7] ).
The trend of countries to increase the number of ODI matches they play means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern players. Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has scored the most runs in ODIs with a total of 18,426. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan is the highest ODI wicket-taker with a total of 534 wickets. The record for most dismissals by a wicket-keeper is held by Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka while the record for most catches by a fielder is held by Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardene .

England rediscover their wild side
12 Jul 2014
The draw had seemed favourite from the first morning, when the slow, intractable pitch drew less than admiring glances from England’s pace bowlers. Yet wickets could still be wrought from it, as Stuart Broad showed on Sunday morning when his double strike in the space of four balls suddenly gave England an unexpected glimpse of victory.
In India’s first innings England’s bowlers were hampered not only by the surface but their failure to get the ball to move sideways, whether through cut, conventional swing or reverse. on Sunday, with a ball 48 overs old and some medium cloud covering, Broad found some reverse-swing, beating Virat Kohli’s forward prod in his first over of the day.
Four balls later he had Ajinkya Rahane caught behind by Prior. It would be tempting to suggest that Rahane nicked the outswinger, but the aspect of the shine on the replay suggested it was simply an inswinger that did not move as much as the batsman suspected.
With record last-wicket stands littering this Test India probably expected a leisurely constitutional. If so, those two quick wickets in the opening three overs would have got the bowels moving.
Broad and Anderson bowled well, troubling both Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja and conceding almost no runs. With pressure building by the ball, Broad should have claimed Dhoni but Cook spilt the catch at first slip when Matt Prior was standing up to the stumps.
The captain did something similar last year against Australia, when he dropped Peter Siddle off Anderson. Then he made amends by catching a blinder a few overs later. His miss this time was similarly inexpensive, though he had little to do with Dhoni’s dismissal, bowled off his pads by Liam Plunkett, other than to bring Plunkett on for Broad.
Jadeja eventually got off the mark on the 38th ball he faced, a slog for four off Anderson. During his scoreless phase he looked as if he might nick off any ball, but his relief at having got off the mark allowed him to settle and he took his team to relative safety with a 65-run partnership with Stuart Binny.
Anderson got him soon after England had taken the second new ball, eventually finding the edge the left-hander had promised all morning. At that stage, India, with three wickets remaining, had a lead of 210 with 55 overs remaining. A quick kill by England and an unexpected victory was not out of the question. But this match has been defined by furiously wagging tails, if such a notion exists in this era of benign pitches and batting practice for all, and when Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Binny added 91, it killed any hopes England had of stealing a win.
Binny eventually fell for 78 when Moeen Ali spun one past his bat, though not before the all-rounder had struck the off-spinner for six over extra cover. Moeen finished with three for 105 off 28 overs but did not really threaten as a spinner should on the final day.
At Lord’s he will have a rival as Simon Kerrigan, the left-arm spinner, has been added to players who assembled for this Test to make a 14-man squad. Kerrigan, who endured a catastrophic debut against Australia last summer when his eight overs cost 53 runs, had been involved in the preparation for this match. Lancashire did not have a game, though they do now, from which he will have to be removed to meet up with the squad in London on Monday evening.
England are unlikely to play two spinners even though the forecast is for hot weather, so it is difficult to see how Kerrigan can get into the team unless they drop Moeen, who scored a magical hundred just one Test ago.
Alternatively, they could play him in place of Ben Stokes or Plunkett, though that would be a huge risk given that Kerrigan panicked in his last Test. MCC has promised a faster, bouncier pitch than the one on which England drew with Sri Lanka and none of the pace bowlers who played here would want to miss out on that.
 



Early life[ edit ]
Fletcher was born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (modern day Harare , Zimbabwe ) and was one of five brothers in a Rhodesian farming family.
Career as player[ edit ]
Fletcher took Zimbabwe to victory in the 1982 ICC Trophy . Fletcher never played Test cricket in his playing career.
Career as coach[ edit ]
Under Fletcher the England cricket team achieved famous series victories away to Sri Lanka, Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa between 2000-2004. In 2004 England won an English record 8 consecutive tests, beating New Zealand 3-0 and West Indies 4-0 at home respectively, before winning the first test in South Africa. His most famous and largest achievement however came in September 2005, when he became the first coach of the English team to win an Ashes series for 18 years when England secured 2-1 victory over Australia.
In recognition of this winning the Ashes after 18 years, Fletcher was conferred with the OBE . On 13 September 2005 Fletcher was awarded British citizenship after a five-year wait. Although both his parents and all his grandparents were ethnically English, i.e. of English/British descent, Fletcher had been denied citizenship by virtue of the fact he spent most of his time abroad—touring with the England team. After the Ashes series win of 2005, the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke , intervened to award Fletcher his long-sought citizenship. [1]
Fletcher received heavy criticism from all quarters after preferring Ashley Giles to Monty Panesar as England's main spinner in the first two Tests of the 2006-07 Ashes series ; Giles took three wickets in two Tests, while Panesar, when given the chance in the third Test, took five wickets in the first innings and three wickets in the second innings. Following defeat to Australia by 206 runs in the third test on 18 December 2006 which saw England relinquish the Ashes 15 months after gaining them, the England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed that Fletcher's position as head coach was under review. Despite a brief reprieve in early 2007 when England won the Commonwealth Bank Series , Fletcher came under increased criticism as England performed poorly in the World Cup , which culminated in a nine wicket loss to South Africa in which the team were booed off the field by England's Barmy Army. It was later announced, on 19 April 2007, that his 8-year tenure as coach was to end following England's final Super 8 match against the West Indies on Saturday 21 April 2007.
England's test record improved almost as soon as Fletcher took over in 1999, however the fortunes of the one-day side plummeted under Fletcher and ironically the only major success in one day cricket under the Fletcher era came a mere three months before his exit, as England won the Commonwealth Bank Series by defeating Australia early in 2007.
In November 2007 Fletcher confirmed that he was considering a switch to rugby, stating "I'd like to be a rugby consultant. I have some ideas...I love my rugby, I would rather watch rugby than cricket. I'm passionate about it, it's the game I'd like to have been involved in."
On 5 November 2007 Fletcher's autobiography Behind The Shades was published.
In November 2008 it was announced that Fletcher would take on a consultancy role with Hampshire for the 2009 season, [2] days later he took a similar role with the South Africa team ahead of their Test series with Bangladesh and Australia. [3]
Fletcher has been appointed as the coach of the India cricket team on 27 April 2011, [4] with a two-year contract. Fletcher was one of the leading candidates for appointment as coach of the India national cricket team . [5] Fletcher bagged the top job in the India national cricket team ahead of names like former New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming and former Zimbabwe skipper Andy Flower . Fletcher is reported to be outgoing India coach Gary Kirsten 's recommendation. [6] Under the coach of Duncan Fletcher, India national cricket team achieved 8 series victory in a row in 2013 including Champions Trophy.

Thive days, has varied through Test history, ranging from three days to timeless matches . [3] [4] The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; [5] since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 11 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because of the increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue. [6]
Cricket is, by its nature, capable of generating large numbers of records and statistics . [7] This list details the most significant team and individual records in Test cricket.
The most successful team in Test cricket, in terms of both wins and win percentage, is Australia, having won 362 of their 773 Tests (46.83%). Barring the ICC World XI, a rest of world team which played a single Test against Australia in 2005, the least successful team are Bangladesh who have struggled since their introduction to Test cricket in 2000, leading to questioning of their Test status. [8] [9] [10]
Australian Donald Bradman , widely considered the greatest batsman of all time, [11] [12] holds several personal and partnership records. He scored the most runs in a series, has the most double centuries and was a part of the record 5th and 6th wicket partnerships . His most significant record is his batting average of 99.94. One of cricket's most famous statistics, [13] [14] it stands almost 40 runs higher than any other batsman's average. Don Bradman is the only player in the world to have scored 5000 runs against a single opposition: 5028 runs against England. [15]
In the Manchester Test of 1956, England spin bowler Jim Laker took 19 wickets for 90 runs (19–90) which set not only the Test record for best match figures but also the first-class one. [16] In taking 10–53 in the second innings he became the first bowler to capture all ten wickets in a Test match innings, and his analysis remains the best innings figures. Indian Leg-spinner Anil Kumble is the only other bowler to have taken 10 wickets in an innings, claiming 10–74 against Pakistan in 1999. [17] West Indies batsman Brian Lara has the highest individual score in Test cricket: he scored 400 not out against England in 2004 to surpass the innings of 380 by Matthew Hayden six months earlier. Lara had held the record before Hayden, with a score of 375 against England 10 years earlier. [18] Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq holds the record of the fastest test half century from just 21 balls and along with West Indies Batsman Viv Richards holds the record of the fastest test century both of them scoring from just 56 balls.
The trend of countries to increase the number of Test matches they play means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern players. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan became the highest Test wicket-taker in December 2007, when he passed Shane Warne 's total of 708 wickets. [19] Within a year, the equivalent batting record of highest run-scorer had also changed hands: Sachin Tendulkar surpassed the tally of 11,953 runs by Brian Lara. [20] The record for most dismissals by a wicket-keeper is held by Mark Boucher of South Africa [21] while the record for most catches by a fielder is held by Rahul Dravid . [22]

List of Twenty20 International records

This article contains records for men's Twenty20 Internationals. For the corresponding women's records visit List of women's Twenty20 International records
Shahid Afridi is the highest wicket-taker in T20I cricket.
Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket is played between international cricket teams who are either Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) or the top six Associate and Affiliate members , [1] as well as Nepal and the Netherlands . [2] Unlike Test matches , T20Is consist of one innings per team, each limited to 20 overs . The first T20I was played between New Zealand and Australia on 17 February 2005; [3] since then there have been over 400 T20Is played by 17 teams. The frequency of matches has steadily increased, partly because of the increase in the number of T20I-playing countries, and partly as the cricket boards of those nations seek to maximise their revenue. [4]
The most successful team in T20I cricket, in terms of win percentage is Sri Lanka (63.84%). [5] The least successful is Zimbabwe (20.96%). [6]
Cricket is, by its nature, capable of generating large numbers of records and statistics . Records and statistics are kept for individual players and teams across the three disciplines of batting, bowling, and fielding. Some of these lists are aggregate in nature. The trend of countries to increase the number of T20I matches they play means that these aggregate lists are dominated by modern players. Examples of such lists include the most career runs, most career wickets taken, most dismissals by a wicketkeeper, and most catches taken. Other, non-aggregate records, include most runs scored in an over, highest career strike rate, and most consecutive wins and defeats.

Qualification[ edit ]
The championship consists of two separate ranking tables. The ten ICC Full Members that play Test cricket are automatically listed on the main table. The six Associate Members with One Day International status are listed on a secondary table, but are eligible for promotion to the main table by meeting one of the following criteria: [4]
two wins in ODIs against Full Members
one win in an ODI against a Full Member and also have won more than 60% of qualifying matches versus other Associates
Ireland qualified for the main table following their victories over Pakistan and Bangladesh in the 2007 World Cup . [5] Latest entrant is Afghanistan, by defeating Bangladesh in 2014 Asia Cup . Netherlands and Kenya were also listed on the main table as they previously had permanent ODI status.
The calculations for the Table are performed as follows:
Each team scores points based on the results of their matches.
Each team's rating is equal to its total points scored divided by the total matches played. (Series are not significant in these calculations).
A match only counts if played in the last four years.
Matches played in the first year of the four-year limit count one-third; matches played in the second year counts half; matches played in the last two years count fully; essentially, recent matches are given higher weighting.
To determine a team's rating after a particular match:
Determine the match result (win, loss, or tie)
Calculate the match points scored:
If the gap between the ratings of the two teams at the commencement of the match is fewer than 40 points, then:
The winner scores 50 points more than the opponent's rating
The loser scores 50 points fewer than the opponent's rating
Each team in a tie scores the opponent's rating
If the gap between the ratings of the two teams at the commencement of the match is more than or equal to 40 points, then :
The winner, if it is the stronger team, scores 10 points more than its own rating
The winner, if it is the weaker team, scores 90 points more than its own rating
The loser, if it is the stronger team, scores 90 points fewer than its own rating
The loser, if it is the weaker team, scores 10 points fewer than its own rating
The stronger team in a tie scores 40 points fewer than its own rating
The weaker team in a tie scores 40 points more than its own rating
Add the match points scored to the points already scored (in previous matches as reflected by the Table) and determine the new rating. However, matches(and the points) which do not lie in last four year range will have to be removed. [2]
Points earned by teams depend on the opponents ratings, therefore this system needed to assign base ratings to teams when it started.

There is a degree of subjectivity in the usage of these terms; for example, Cricinfo uses the terms "fast-medium" and "medium-fast" interchangeably, [2] and sometimes replacing medium-fast to medium. For comparison, most spin bowlers in professional cricket bowl at average speeds of 70 to 90 km/h (45 to 55 mph). The ability of some bowlers to deliver a variation ball, faster or slower than their standard, can cause some confusion as they could appear to put them in different categories, for example, Brett Lee bowls his stock ball at around 145 km/h, making him a fast bowler, although he will occasionally bowl a slower ball at around 115 km/h, and his slowest bouncers can go as slow as 100 km/h late in his domestic career. Conversely, Shahid Afridi , a spin-bowler, has a quicker ball which can reach 134 km/h, and Stuart Broad, a fast-medium bowler, Mitchell Marsh and Jimmy Neesham (both listed as medium-fast or medium pacers) can sometimes bowl at over 145 km/h in Australian conditions, especially Brisbane and WACA . However, these are rarely taken into account in determining what category a bowler fits in because these deliveries are variations, intended to surprise the batsman, not the standard pace of a bowler. Brett Lee , Shoaib Akhtar , Shaun Tait and Mitchell Starc have clocked over 160km/h and are categorized as "Ultra Fast" bowlers although often bowling at speeds significantly lower than this mark. Also, while Steven Finn is classified as a fast-medium bowler by Cricinfo, he can consistently bowl at around 145km/h, with his fastest clocked at 151.9km/h, making him the 10th fastest amongst active bowlers as of 3 January 2015 [3]
Technique in fast bowling[ edit ]

(August 2013)
Grip[ edit ]
The first thing a fast bowler needs to do is to grip the ball correctly. The basic fast bowling grip to achieve maximum speed is to hold the ball with the seam upright and to place the index and middle fingers close together at the top of the seam with the thumb gripping the ball at the bottom of the seam. The image to the right shows the correct grip. The first two fingers and the thumb should hold the ball forward of the rest of the hand, and the other two fingers should be tucked into the palm. The ball is held quite loosely so that it leaves the hand easily. Other grips are possible, and result in different balls - see swing and seam bowling below. The bowler usually holds their other hand over the hand gripping the ball until the latest possible moment so that the batsman cannot see what type of ball is being bowled.
Run-up[ edit ]
A fast bowler needs to take a longer run-up toward the wicket than a spinner, due to the need to generate the momentum and rhythm required to bowl a fast delivery. Fast bowlers will measure their preferred run up in strides and mark the distance from the wicket. It is important for the bowler to know exactly how long his or her run-up is because it needs to terminate at the popping crease . If the bowler steps over this, he or she will have bowled a no ball . A no ball means the bowler will have to bowl again, awards a penalty of one or two runs to the batting team, and allows them to score additional runs with a reduced risk of dismissal.
Action[ edit ]

At the end of the run-up the bowler will bring his lead foot down on the pitch with the knee as straight as possible. This aids in generating speed but can be dangerous due to the pressure placed on the joint by this action. Knee injuries are not uncommon amongst fast bowlers: for example, the English pace bowler David Lawrence was sidelined for many months after splitting his kneecap in two. The pressure on the leading foot is such that some fast bowlers cut the front off their shoes to stop their toes from being injured as they are repeatedly pressed against the inside of the shoe. The bowler will then bring their bowling arm up over their head and release the ball at the height appropriate to where they want the ball to pitch. Again, the arm must be straight although this is a stipulation of the laws of cricket rather than an aid to speed. Bending the elbow and "chucking" the ball would make it too easy for the bowler to aim accurately at the batsman's wicket and get them out.
Mitchell Johnson bowling. Note the "sling shot" action.
Fast bowlers tend to have an action which leaves them either side-on or chest-on at the end of the run up. A chest on bowler has chest and hips aligned towards the batsman at the instant of back foot contact , while a side on bowler has chest and hips aligned at ninety degrees to the batsman at the instant of back foot contact. West Indian bowler Malcolm Marshall was a classic example of a chest on bowler, while Australian pace bowler Dennis Lillee used a side on technique to great effect.
While a bowler's action does not affect the speed at which they bowl, it can limit the style of balls that they can bowl. Although this is not a hard and fast rule, side on bowlers generally bowl outswingers , and front on bowlers generally bowl inswingers .
A variant on the fast bowler's action is the sling (sometimes referred to as the slingshot or javelin), where the bowler begins his delivery with his or her arm fully extended behind their back. The slinging action generates extra speed, but sacrifices control. The most famous exponent of the slinging action is Jeff Thomson , who bowled at extraordinary pace off a short run up. Current internationals who employ a slinging action include Fidel Edwards , Shaun Tait , Lasith Malinga and Mitchell Johnson .
Follow through[ edit ]
Matthew Hoggard begins his follow-through in training.
After the ball has been released, the bowler "follows through" at the end of his or her action. This involves veering to the side so as not to tread on the pitch and taking a few more strides to slow down. Striding on to the pitch at the end of a delivery can damage the surface resulting in rough patches which spin bowlers can exploit to get extra turn on the ball; doing so is illegal according to the laws of the game. Bowlers who persistently run onto the pitch can be warned, with three warnings disqualifying a bowler from bowling again during the innings .
Line and length[ edit ]

(August 2013)
An effective fast bowler needs to be able to hold a consistent line and length , or in common terms, to be accurate. In this context, line refers to the path of the ball towards the batsman, in the horizontal dimension running from the off to the leg side, while length describes the distance the ball travels toward the batsman before bouncing. Variations in length is generally seen as the more important of the two for a fast bowler. The faster the bowler, the harder it is to achieve consistent line and length but sheer speed can make up for the shortfall. Fast bowlers who also manage to be accurate can be devastatingly effective, for example the likes of Australian pace bowler Glenn McGrath and South African pace bowler Shaun Pollock .
Line[ edit ]
In modern cricket, the two lines usually aimed for by fast bowlers is the so-called corridor of uncertainty , the area just outside the batsman's off stump , or actually on the stumps. It is difficult for the batsman to tell whether or not such a ball is likely to strike their wicket, and thus to know whether to attack, defend or leave the ball. This technique was historically known as off theory (contrast leg theory ), but it is now so routine that it is rarely given a name at all, or forgotten about completely. Of course, variation in line is also important and deliveries aimed at the leg stump can also serve a purpose.
Precise mastery of the line of the ball is best utilised when a batsman is known to have a weakness hitting a particular shot, because a bowler with an effective line can place the ball in the weak spot time after time. Failing to overcome a persistent inability to hit balls on a certain line has been enough to end the careers of innumerable batsmen once they had been found out by skilled line bowlers.

Lengths of balls showing name & bounce height (arriving at the batsman). Angles are exaggerated.
A good length ball or salmon ball is one that arrives at the batsman at around waist height. There is no fixed distance to a good length, or indeed any other length of ball in cricket since the distance required will vary with the speed of the ball, the state of the pitch and the height of the bowler and batsman. It should be noted that bowling a "good length" in this sense is not always appropriate - in some situations, on some pitches and against some batsmen other lengths will be more effective. The diagram to the right should help explain what the different lengths mean.
A ball which bounces a little way before the good length and rises to the batsman's abdomen is said to be short pitched or described as a long hop and is easier for a batsman to hit as he will have had more time to see if the height or line of the ball has deviated after bouncing.[ dubious – discuss ] A short-pitched ball is also at a more suitable height for the batsman to play an attacking pull shot . A ball which bounces significantly before the good length and reaches shoulder or head height is a bouncer and can be an effective delivery. Any ball which is short enough to bounce over the batsman's head is usually called wide by the Umpire . Bowling short pitched or wide balls is a bad idea as they are relatively easy for the batsman to defend or attack.
At the other end of the scale, balls which bounce slightly closer to the batsman than the good length are said to be full pitched or overpitched or described as a half volley. These are often easier for the batsman to play than the good length because they do not have time to move much after bouncing off the seam and, arriving at the batsmen low to the ground, are ideal for drive strokes. However, in conditions favourable to swing bowling full pitched bowling gives the ball more time to move through the air challenging the batsman weigh up the risk of being able to play drives against uncertainty about the swing. Closer still to the batsman's feet is the yorker . an effective yorker's length will be difficult to pick early forcing the batsman back into the crease. Additionally, because it bounces at the batsmen's feet, a well bowled yorker is not playable by a conventional cricket shot. If the ball fails to bounce at all before reaching the batsman it is labelled a full toss or beam ball. It is very easy for a batsman to play such a delivery as it will not have deviated at all from bouncing off the pitch.
It is because the three effective lengths (good length, bouncer and yorker ) are all interspersed by lengths which are easy for the batsman to hit that control of length is an impanada since childhood (see the relevant section of the main CFL article ). Eligible players can be drafted both from CIS football programs in Canada and U.S. college football programs (with the latter category containing one Canadian school, Simon Fraser ).
International players, which can compose up to half of a CFL team's roster, are not subject to a draft and enter the league as free agents. This includes almost all of the league's quarterbacks .
Main article: Disaster draft
Major professional sports leagues (including the KHL, MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL) have special contingency plans for rebuilding a team should an accident or other disaster kill or disable many players.
Other terminology[ edit ]
A draft bust occurs when a highly touted or highly selected draftee does not meet expectations. This can be for a variety of reasons, but the most often noted are injury or inability to perform at a professional level. A player is also regarded as a larger bust if more successful players are drafted after him or her. An example of a draft bust occurred in the 1998 NFL Draft . The San Diego Chargers selected promising quarterback Ryan Leaf with the second overall pick, after Peyton Manning . However, Leaf only managed to play two years with the Chargers and started only 18 games (and winning only 4 games) for them before being released. [5] [6] [7] Other frequently cited examples include JaMarcus Russell , Tony Mandarich and Akili Smith . [8] [9] [10] In the NBA, an example LaRue Martin , drafted 1st overall in the 1972 NBA Draft ahead of Bob McAdoo and Julius Erving . McAdoo and Erving went on to be elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and are both usually mentioned as all-time greats, whereas Martin only played 4 NBA seasons for a career average of just over 5 points per game before retiring as arguably the biggest NBA draft bust ever. Other NBA draft busts include Sam Bowie (1984, who had a modestly productive though injury-prone career, but is particularly infamous for having been drafted one spot ahead of Michael Jordan ), Michael Olowokandi (1998), Kwame Brown (2001), Darko Miličić (2003), Adam Morrison (2006), Andrea Bargnani (2006) and Greg Oden (2007). Notable MLB draft busts include Steve Chilcott (1966), Brien Taylor (1991), and Matt Bush (2004), three 1st overall draft picks who never reached the majors. A player like outfielder Josh Hamilton (1999) can also be considered a draft bust before unexpectedly turning their career around. A notable NHL draft bust is Alexandre Daigle (1993). Daigle is notable for saying "I'm glad I went number one, cause no one remembers number two." upon being drafted by the Ottawa Senators . The number two selection that year happened to be Hall of Famer Chris Pronger . Example of draft busts in the Australian Football League include former Essendon player Scott Gumbleton and former Hawthorn player Mitch Thorp . [11] [12] [13] Gumbleton and Thorp was drafted with picks 2 and 6 respectively in the 2006 AFL Draft ahead of future All-Australian players Travis Boak , Joel Selwood , James Frawley and Jack Riewoldt . Thorp managed just 2 games in 3 years with Hawthorn before getting delisted while Gumbleton managed just 35 games in 6 years with Essendon before being traded to Fremantle , and subsequently retiring without playing a single game for his new club.
Conversely, a lowly-drafted player going on to have a stellar career is a draft steal. Twelve-time MLB All-Star selection Mike Piazza , drafted last in the 1988 draft (and only as a favor from Tommy Lasorda ), became one of the best catchers of the 1990s and is a probable future Hall of Famer. In the NFL , one of the more notable examples is Tom Brady , who was drafted in the sixth round, and went on to win four Super Bowls and achieved more success than the players drafted before him. Similarly, two-time Super Bowl champion Roger Staubach was a tenth round pick in both the AFL and NFL drafts largely due to having a four-year commitment to serve in the U.S. Navy ; Pro Football Hall of Famers Joe Montana and Dan Fouts were both third round picks, with Montana slipping due to an average showing at the combine ; Drew Brees , MVP of Super Bowl XLIV , dropped to the second round after being generally dismissed by scouts due to a mediocre performance at the combine and his height [14] but went on to break or set NFL records for passing yards and touchdown passes; Johnny Unitas , who is considered as one of the greatest quarterbacks in the history of the game, [15] was drafted in the ninth round; and Bart Starr , two-time Super Bowl MVP, was the 200th overall pick. In the NBA, Manu Ginóbili , a key contributor to four San Antonio Spurs championships in the 21st century and centerpiece of Argentina's Olympic gold medal team in 2004 , was the next-to-last pick in the 1999 draft. In the NHL, Luc Robitaille , drafted 171st in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft , would eventually retire as the highest-scoring left winger in NHL history. Interestingly, Pavel Datsyuk , also drafted 171st in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft , would go on to win multiple Stanley Cups and be considered one of the most talented players of all time. [16] An example of a draft steal in the Australian Football League is Hawthorn Football Club midfielder Sam Mitchell [11] [17] who was drafted with pick 36 in the 2001 AFL Draft . Mitchell went on to become a three time premiership player, a premiership captain with Hawthorn in 2008, a two time All-Australian , a four time Peter Crimmins Medallist and the 2003 AFL Rising Star . Another example of a draft steal in the AFL is former Essendon Football Club midfielder James Hird , [11] [17] [18] was drafted with pick 79 in the 1990 AFL Draft . Hird went on to become a two time premiership player, a premiership captain in 2000, the 1996 Brownlow Medalist , the 2000 Norm Smith Medallist , a five time All-Australian , a five time W. S. Crichton Medalist , a member of the Essendon Team of the Century and the AFL Hall of Fame . Another example of a draft steal in the AFL is Collingwood Football Club midfielder Dane Swan , [17] [18] who was drafted with pick 58 in the 2001 AFL Draft . Swan would go on to become a premiership player with Collingwood, a three time Copeland Trophy winner, the 2011 Brownlow Medalist and a five time All Australian.
Mr. Irrelevant is a title given to the last player selected in each year's NFL Draft. The phrase pokes fun at the typically poor chances such a player has of ultimately making an impact in the league, although several went on to productive NFL careers.
Some unusual draft picks in professional sports history have included Taro Tsujimoto , a fictional Japanese ice hockey forward who was drafted in the 1974 NHL Amateur Draft by the Buffalo Sabres (a move made in protest of the league's decision to hold the draft by phone), and Derrell Robertson , a man who was mistakenly drafted by the Ottawa Rough Riders in the 1995 CFL Dispersal Draft despite being dead.

Biography
1972–1989: Early life and introduction to cricket
Sourav Ganguly was born on 8 July 1972 in Calcutta , and is the youngest son of Chandidas and Nirupa Ganguly. [10] [11] Chandidas ran a flourishing print business and was one of the richest men in the city. [12] Ganguly had a luxurious childhood and was nicknamed the 'Maharaja', meaning the 'Great King'. Ganguly's father Chandidas Ganguly died at the age of 73 on 21 February 2013 after a long illness. [13]
Since the favourite sport for the people of Calcutta was the game of football , Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not very supportive of Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career. [14] [15] By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team . He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth grade at that time. [16]
Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so he could use his brother's sporting equipment. [14] After he showed some promise as a batsman, he was enrolled in a cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower , whom Ganguly admired. [12] After he scored a century against the Orissa Under–15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. [14] [17] While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man , as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. [18] Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. [19] However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team. [14] [20]

The Lord's Pavilion
Following a prolific Ranji season in 1990–91, [21] Ganguly scored three runs in his One Day International  (ODI) debut for India against the West Indies in 1992. [10] [22] He was dropped immediately since he was perceived to be "arrogant" and his attitude towards the game was openly questioned. It was rumoured that Ganguly refused to carry drinks for his teammates, commenting that it was not his job to do so, later denied by him. Consequently, he was removed from the team. [14] [19] He toiled away in domestic cricket, scoring heavily in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 Ranji seasons. [23] [24] Following an innings of 171 in the 1995–96 Duleep Trophy , he was recalled to the National team for a tour of England in 1996, in the middle of intense media scrutiny. [25] He played in a single ODI, [26] but was omitted from the team for the first Test . However, after teammate Navjot Singh Sidhu left the touring, citing ill-treatment by then captain Mohammad Azharuddin , [27] [28] Ganguly made his Test debut against England in the Second Test of a three-match series at Lord's Cricket Ground alongside Rahul Dravid . [29] England had won the First Test of the three-match series; however, Ganguly scored a century, becoming only the third cricketer to achieve such a feat on debut at Lord's, after Harry Graham and John Hampshire . Andrew Strauss and Matt Prior have since accomplished this feat, but Ganguly's 131 still remains the highest by any batsman on his debut at the ground. [28] India was not required to bat in the second innings due to the match ending in a draw. [30] In the next Test match at Trent Bridge he made 136, thus becoming only the third batsman to make a century in each of his first two innings (after Lawrence Rowe and Alvin Kallicharran ). He shared a 255 run stand with Sachin Tendulkar , which became at that time the highest partnership for India against any country for any wicket outside India. The Test again ended in a draw, handing England a 1–0 series victory; Ganguly scored 48 in the second innings. [31] [32]
1997–99: Marriage, Opening in ODIs and World Cup '99

Ganguly in Sri Lanka in 2008.
Weeks after his successful tour of England, Ganguly eloped with childhood sweetheart Dona Roy. The bride and groom's family were sworn enemies at that point and this news caused an uproar between them. However, both families reconciled and a formal wedding was held in February 1997. [14] [33] Same year, Ganguly scored his maiden ODI century by hitting 113, opposed to Sri Lanka 's team total of 238. Later that year, he won four consecutive man of the match awards, in the Sahara Cup with Pakistan ; the second of these was won after he took five wickets for 16 runs off 10 overs , his best bowling in an ODI. After a barren run in Test cricket his form returned at the end of the year with three centuries in four Tests, all against Sri Lanka, and two of these involved stands with Sachin Tendulkar of over 250. [10]
During the final of the Independence Cup at Dhaka in January 1998, India successfully chased down 315 off 48 overs, and Ganguly won the Man of the Match award. [34] In March 1998 he was part of the Indian team that defeated Australia ; in Kolkata, he took three wickets having opened the bowling with his medium pace. [35]
Ganguly was part of the Indian team that competed in the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England. During the match against Sri Lanka at Taunton , India chose to bat. After Sadagoppan Ramesh was bowled, Ganguly scored 183 from 158 balls, and hit 17 fours and seven sixes. It became the second highest score in World Cup history and the highest by an Indian in the tournament. His partnership of 318 with Rahul Dravid is the highest overall score in a World Cup and is the second highest in all ODI cricket. [36] [37] In 1999–00, India lost Test series to both Australia and South Africa that involved a combined total of five Tests. [38] [39] Ganguly struggled scoring 224 runs at 22.40; however his ODI form was impressive, with five centuries over the season taking him to the top of the PwC One Day Ratings for batsmen. [40] Around the same time, allegations came that Ganguly was romantically involved with South Indian actress Nagma , something he denied. [41]
2000–05: Ascension to captaincy and accolades
"People will support you,people will criticize you.When you cross that rope everything is about you"
Sourav Ganguly to the media

In 2000, after the match fixing scandal by some of the players of the team, [42] Ganguly was named the Captain of the Indian cricket team. The decision was spurred due to Tendulkar stepping down from the position for his health, and Ganguly being the vice-captain at that time. [14] He began well as a captain, leading India to a series win over South Africa in the five-match one day series and led the Indian team to the finals of the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy . [14] He scored two centuries, including one in the final; however, New Zealand still won by four wickets. [43] The same year, Ganguly tried his hand at county cricket career in England but was not successful. [44] In " The Wisden Cricketer ", reviewers Steve Pittard and John Stern called him as "The imperious Indian—dubbed 'Lord Snooty'. They commented:
"At the crease it was sometimes uncertain whether his partner was a batsman or a batman being dispatched to take his discarded sweater to the pavilion or carry his kit bag. But mutiny was afoot among the lower orders. In one match Ganguly, after reaching his fifty, raised his bat to the home balcony, only to find it deserted. He did not inspire at Glamorgan or Northamptonshire either. At the latter in 2006 he averaged 4.80 from his four first-class appearances." [45]
His Lancashire teammate Andrew Flintoff thought him to be aloof and compared his attitude to that of Prince Charles . [17] In Australia's three Test and five match ODI tour of India in early 2001, Ganguly caused controversy by arriving late for the toss on four occasions, something that agitated opposing captain Steve Waugh . [46] In the Fourth ODI, he caused further controversy by failing to wear his playing attire to the toss, something considered unusual in cricket circles. [47] However, India won the Test series 2–1, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive Test match victories in the Second Test. [48] The match saw India looking set for defeat after conceding a first innings lead of 274. Waugh chose to enforce the followemony, the Australians made an early breakthrough with the wicket of Adam Lyth (6). The arrival of Gary Ballance saw a mini-partnership develop between him and captain Alastair Cook , before Cook (20) edged a ball from spinner Nathan Lyon to wicket-keeper Brad Haddin , followed almost immediately by Ian Bell (1), trapped LBW by Mitchell Starc . That brought Joe Root to the crease to join his Yorkshire team-mate Ballance, and the pair raced to their respective fifties, putting on 153 runs for the fourth wicket before Ballance was trapped LBW by Josh Hazlewood for 61. Root and Ben Stokes then shared a fifth-wicket stand of 84 before Root was caught out by Shane Watson off Starc for a total of 134, having rescued England from 43/3 to 280/5. Stokes completed his half-century before he was bowled by Starc for 52, and Jos Buttler was also out for 27 after a seventh-wicket stand of exactly 50 with Moeen Ali , but England managed to see out the day on 343/7. [13]
Having been 26 not out overnight, Moeen Ali added another 51 runs on the morning of the second day before he was caught out by Watson off Starc. Stuart Broad 's 18 was the only significant contribution to the England total among the tail, and Starc completed a five-wicket haul when he bowled James Anderson to end the England innings on 430. Australia made a steady start to their response, putting on 52 runs before David Warner was caught by Cook in the slips for 17. Next to go for Australia was Steve Smith , recently ranked as the best Test batsman in the world, [14] caught at short mid-on by Cook off the bowling of Moeen Ali for 33. Meanwhile, Chris Rogers reached 95 before edging a ball from Mark Wood through to Buttler to become the first player to record seven consecutive Test fifties without converting one to a century; it was also Wood's maiden Ashes wicket. A second wicket for Moeen Ali soon followed, as he caught Australia captain Michael Clarke off his own bowling. A 50-run partnership between Adam Voges and Shane Watson for the fifth wicket was ended shortly before the end of the day, with Voges caught by Anderson off Stokes for 31, leaving Australia on 264/5 at the close of play. [15]
Australia batting on the morning of the third day
The third morning started with two quick wickets, with Watson and nightwatchman Lyon departing for the addition of just one run. A flurry of runs from Haddin and Mitchell Johnson saw Australia pass 300, but the last two wickets fell for just four runs, and Australia were all out for 308, still 122 runs behind England. As England began their second innings, the Australians again made early breakthroughs, with Cook out for 12 and Ballance out for a duck , before Lyth and Bell shared a stand of 51 runs for the third wicket. The partnership was broken when Clarke made a one-handed catch to dismiss Lyth for 37, but Bell batted on to reach his first Test half-century in 10 innings. He and Root put on 97 for the fourth wicket before Bell was out for 60, bowled by Johnson for the Australian's first wicket of the match, following first-innings figures of 0/111. Root followed 11 overs later for exactly the same score off exactly the same number of balls, and dismissed in exactly the same manner by Hazlewood. Stokes then made a useful 42, but after the dismissal of Buttler (7), there was a clatter of wickets, reducing England from 236/5 to 245/8 in less than three overs. Wood hit a quickfire 32 not out off 18 balls to push England towards 300, but they were eventually bowled out for 289, a lead of 411. With rain forecast for the fifth day, England knew that they would have to bowl Australia out on day 4 to ensure victory. [16]
With Australia chasing 412 to win, they lost Rogers for 10 early on, ending his record-equalling run of half-centuries, but a 78-run partnership between Warner and Smith looked to have stabilised the innings. The stand was broken by Moeen Ali in the final over before lunch, trapping Warner LBW for 52. Australia then lost Smith (33), Clarke (4) and Voges (1) in the five overs following the interval; in the space of six overs, they had fallen from 97/1 to 106/5. Haddin was next to go, caught at short midwicket by Cook for 7; the England captain parried the ball up at the first attempt, but retained his focus to cling on at the second time of asking. Watson (19) did his best to reignite the innings before being trapped LBW for the second time in the match, reducing Australia to 151/7. Johnson and Starc then shared a 72-run partnership for the eighth wicket, only for Root's off spin to find both their edges to leave the tourists 169 behind with one wicket in hand. Root was again involved in the final wicket, as Moeen Ali tempted Hazlewood into a big shot down the ground to long on, where Root was waiting to take the catch and seal victory. For his contributions primarily with the bat, but also with the ball, Root was named Man of the Match. [17]



The fourth edition was held in India in 1990-91. Pakistan had pulled out of the tournament due to strained political relations with India. India retained its hold on the Asia Cup defeating Sri Lanka in the final.
In 1993, the tournament was cancelled due to strained political relations between India and Pakistan.
The fifth edition, in 1995, took the series back to Sharjah , UAE after 11 years. India and Sri Lanka made it to the final by virtue of better run rate than Pakistan as all three teams had equal points after the preliminary round. For the third successive time in the Asia Cup, India defeated Sri Lanka in the final.
The sixth edition was held in Sri Lanka in 1997. Sri Lanka beat India in the final by 8 wickets to win its second Asia Cup and halt India's three consecutive cup victories.
Main articles: 2000 Asia Cup , 2004 Asia Cup , 2008 Asia Cup and 2010 Asia Cup
The seventh edition took place in Bangladesh for the second time in 2000. Pakistan and Sri Lanka made it to the final while India only won one match against Bangladesh and did not qualify for the final for the first time. In the final, Pakistan beat Sri Lanka and lifted the Asia Cup for the first time.
The eighth edition took place in Sri Lanka four years after the seventh edition in 2004. There was a change in the tournament format this time. Other Asian teams like UAE and Hong Kong were also included for the first time and the tournament was now divided into three stages – the Group Stage, the round-robin Super Fours and the final. The group stage was divided into two groups of 3 teams, each playing each other once. The top two teams from each group qualified for the Super Four stage where they played each other again once. The top two teams in the Super Four stage then qualified for the final. Hosts Sri Lanka, India and UAE were placed in Group A while the then defending champions Pakistan, Bangladesh and Hong Kong were placed in Group B. UAE and Hong Kong were knocked out in the group stage. Bangladesh had the distinction of reaching the second stage in a major tournament for the first time, but played poorly in the Super Fours and got eliminated. India and Sri Lanka topped the Super Four stage and reached the final. In the final, Sri Lanka defeated India by 25 runs to win the Asia Cup.
The ninth edition of the Asia Cup was held in Pakistan . Once again, the 2004 format was retained. The tournament started on 24 June 2008 and ended on 6 July 2008. [11] Sri Lanka topped Group A and qualified for the second phase along with Bangladesh. In Group B, India came out on top and entered the Super Fours along with Pakistan in second place. Sri Lanka and India topped the Super Four stage and entered the final. Sri Lanka beat India in the final comfortably to equal India with four Asia Cup trophies. Sanath Jayasuriya smashed a quick 125 off 114 balls to rescue Sri Lanka from 66/4 earlier on when the top order collapsed. Sri Lanka's new mystery spinner, Ajantha Mendis , grabbed figures of 6/13 that left India in tatters.
The tenth edition was held in Sri Lanka , which hosted the Asia Cup for the fourth time, between 15–24 June 2010. It only featured the four Test playing Asian nations, and seven matches were played in all (includi-on and V. V. S. Laxman (281) and Rahul Dravid (180) batted for the entire fourth day's play to set Australia a target of 384 on a dusty, spinning wicket. The Australians were unable to survive and became only the third team to lose a Test after enforcing the follow-on. [49] [50] [51] In November 2001, Ganguly's wife Dona gave birth to their daughter Sana Ganguly. [14] During the final match of the 2002 NatWest Series held in Lords after a stunning performance by team mates Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif , Ganguly took off his shirt in public and brandished it in the air to celebrate India's winning of the match. [52] He was later strongly condemned for tarnishing the "gentleman's game" image of cricket and disrespecting Lord's protocol. Ganguly said that he was only mimicking an act performed by the British all-rounder Andrew Flintoff during a tour of India. [53] In 2003, India reached the World Cup Final for the first time since 1983, where they lost to the Australians. [54] Ganguly had a successful tournament personally, scoring 465 runs at an average of 58.12, including three centuries. [55]

By 2004, he had achieved significant success as captain and was deemed as India's most successful cricket captain by sections of the media. However, his individual performance deteriorated during his captaincy reign, especially after the World Cup, the tour of Australia in 2003 and the Pakistan series in 2004. [56] [57] In 2004, Australia won a Test series in India for the first time since 1969. It was speculated that Ganguly was in disagreement with the head of cricket in Nagpur over the type of pitch to be used for the Third Test. The groundsmen went against Ganguly, leaving a large amount of grass on the pitch. Some experts indicated that the reason for this was for "spite or revenge" against the Indian captain. When Australia's stand-in-captain, Adam Gilchrist, went to the toss, he noticed Rahul Dravid was waiting instead of Ganguly, leaving him to ask Dravid where Ganguly was. Dravid could not give a definitive answer, saying: "Oh, who knows?" [46] [58]
Following indifferent form in 2004 and poor form in 2005, he was dropped from the team in October 2005. [59] Having been nominated and rejected in 2000, when the game suffered a tarnished reputation due to match fixing scandals, [42] the captaincy was passed to Dravid, his former deputy. Ganguly decided against retiring and attempted to make a comeback to the team. [19] Ganguly was awarded the Padma Shri in 2004, India's fourth highest civilian award, in recognition of his distinguished contribution in the field of sports. He was presented with the award on 30 June 2004, by then President of India , Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam . [60] [61]
2006–07: Comeback and rift with Greg Chappell
Main article: Chappell Ganguly controversy
Ganguly signing autographs outside his residence.
In September 2005, Greg Chappell became the coach of India for the tour of Zimbabwe. Ganguly's dispute with him resulted in many headlines. Chappell had emailed the Board of Control for Cricket in India , stating that Ganguly was "physically and mentally" unfit to lead India and that his "divide and rule" behaviour was damaging the team. [19] This email was leaked to the media and resulted in huge backlash from Ganguly's fans. Ganguly had enlisted the support from the Indian media and eventually the board had to intervene and order a truce between the pair. [19] BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra issued a statement that,
"In view of the decision that cricket is to go forward, both the coach and the captain have been asked to work out a mutual and professional working relationship. For this, performance will be the criteria, applicable to captain, coach and players. [...] Of course the captain controls the game, the coach does his own job. Mutual trust is important. Henceforth no player/captain/coach will write or have any interaction with the media. Going to the media will lead to disciplinary action."[ citation needed ]

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 4th day October 20, 2008
'Empty stands a challenge' - Bindra

Crowds stayed away from the Test in Mohali even with Sachin Tendulkar breaking Brian Lara's record for most Test runs

In a week of surprising, distressing events - turbulence in the airline industry, the crash of the stock market and the collapse of a flyover in Delhi - the one foreseeable positive was Sachin Tendulkar becoming the world's leading run-getter in Tests. Yet when he got it the response at the ground was underwhelming - because the stands were largely empty.
There are various reasons put forward but IS Bindra, the Punjab Cricket Association chief, conceded the paying public has been "short-changed" in most Indian grounds and he promised to improve conditions in Mohali.
The poor turnout had people wondering if Test cricket still retains its popularity, for the same venue was sold out for the IPL and last year's one-dayer between India and Pakistan. IS Bindra, the Punjab Cricket Association president, said one of the reasons for the disappointing numbers could be the number of matches Mohali hosted last year. "We had 13 matches last year... Mohali, with a population of 1 million, cannot sustain in terms of crowd response," Bindra said. "That's what our research says." Chandigarh, the big city where the teams stay during matches in Mohali, may have a fraction more.
Another reason for the poor turnout could be the mental demands of watching Test cricket, which is different to watching ODIs and Twenty20s, offering fewer moments of obvious excitement and requiring far more concentration.
Perhaps the most significant factor, and one which Bindra himself conceded, is the poor spectator facilities - ironic, because Mohali's facilities are unmatched in India - and the stringent security measures. Getting to the ground is hard enough - the police don't allow anyone other than VIPs to bring their cars within a kilometre of the stadium. One of the most ridiculous security procedures was to force people down a 200-metre path when there was another, more direct route a quarter of the length. "That route is meant only for VIPs," a security official said.
Having reached the ground, the spectator is faced with restrictions on carrying water bottles and umbrellas. The only covered stands are those for members; non-members sit through the day under the sun, on plastic chairs that can get very uncomfortable in temperatures touching 30 degrees Celsius. Why walk a kilometre, then spend seven hours under the sun when you can watch it all on TV?
It's a point Bindra readily concedes. "If you can watch Test-match cricket for five days in the air-conditioned comfort of your own home, here you spend two hours getting into the stadium, going through the police," Bindra said. "The TRP ratings [for Tests] are very high, but it is essential to have people at the ground. We have to make our grounds spectator-friendly. We have been short-changing the public [in most Indian grounds] so far, the public will start short-changing us unless we improve."
Bindra said the association was "badly affected" by the lack of spectators for the Test. "It's the pride of the ground, and we take it very seriously. It's a challenge we must accept, and take it very seriously." He said the PCA planned two new international centres, in Bathinda and Jalandhar. "So if we rotate the matches, the novelty will still be there. Money is not everything, money is not an end in itself. It's good so far as it goes into the game. There's no atmosphere without the people."
There is a photograph of the stadium during the 2004-05 Ranji Trophy final between Railways and Punjab. The wide shot takes in the empty stands, where only two people sit watching the championship match. If the PCA doesn't want similar photos taken during Tests, it must act fast. Otherwise, as Bindra said, the public will short-change it.

Perhaps now, with all the records behind him, Sachin Tendulkar can enjoy a second childhood and bat with something of the insouciance that maortant discipline for a fast bowler. Spin bowlers on the other hand are almost always aiming for the good length but need a much finer control of flight and line to be effective. A fast bowler tries to be physically fit throughout his cricket career, which may span more than a decade. Needless to say that is tough to do and needs a lot of discipline and luck.

(August 2013)
Strike bowling is the term usually applied to bowlers that are used mainly to get a batsman out at the possible expense of runs if the wicket-taking is unsuccessful. For fast bowlers, this can be achieved through sheer speed and aggression, rather than trying to make the ball move through the air or off the pitch. More commonly however, aggressive bowling techniques can be combined with swing bowling and seam bowling techniques to create nigh-on unplayable balls in the hands of a bowler of any speed. The inswinging yorker is seen as particularly deadly.
Main article: Bouncer (cricket)
A bouncer is a ball which is aimed to pitch in the first half of the pitch, meaning it has had time to rise sharply to chest or head height by the time it reaches the batsman. This causes two problems for the batsman who receives the ball. If he or she attempts to play it, their bat will be at eye-level making it difficult for them to watch the ball onto the bat and time their shot correctly. If he or she leaves or misses the ball, it may strike him or her a painful blow on the head or chest and occasionally result in injury. For this reason, bowling spells containing many bouncers are said to be intimidatory bowling.
The usual response to a bouncer is for the batsman simply to duck underneath it, but this requires fast reflexes and a strong nerve and the batsman is sometimes hit in any case. The natural reflex is to attempt to defend one's head with a straight bat but this should be suppressed if possible as the likely result of this will be that the ball flies off the bat at an uncontrolled angle making for an easy catch . Most batsman have panicked and lost their wickets in this fashion several times in their career after prolonged spells of bouncers.
Physically powerful batsmen often attempt to strike the ball on the rise, even though this obstructs their vision of the ball since it is not uncommon that their sheer brute force combined with the speed of the ball will cause it to fly to the boundary. This possibility, combined with the difficulty that the wicketkeeper will have trying to stop a high ball means that bouncers can be expensive in terms of runs against skilled batsmen.

(August 2012)
The ICC Player Rankings is a widely followed system of rankings for international cricketers based on their recent performances. The current sponsor is Reliance Mobile who have signed a deal with the ICC that will last until 2015. [1]
The ratings were developed at the suggestion of Ted Dexter in 1987. The intention was to produce a better indication of players' current standing in the sport than is provided by comparing their averages. Career averages are based on a player's entire career and do not make any allowance for match conditions or the strength of the opposition, whereas the ratings are biased towards recent form and account for match conditions and the quality of the opponent using statistical measures.
Initially the rankings were for Test cricket only, but separate One Day International rankings were introduced in 1998. Both sets of rankings have now been calculated back to the start of those forms of the game. The rankings include the top 10 Test, ODI and T20I batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders based on the rating of each player.

1996[ edit ]
The first tournament was played in Denmark in 1996. The participating teams were Denmark , Gibraltar , Netherlands , Ireland , Israel , Italy , Scotland and an England Board XI. The tournament was won by Ireland after beating the Netherlands in the final. [2]
1998[ edit ]
In 1998, the tournament was split into two Divisions, although teams from the two Divisions still played each other in the final play-off matches. The teams from the previous tournaments were joined by France and Germany . The tournament was won by the hosts, the Netherlands . [3]
2000[ edit ]
The Divisional structure was tightened for this tournament, with teams from the two divisions not playing each other. The teams from the previous tournament were this time joined by Greece and Portugal . The tournament was played in Scotland and was again won by the Netherlands. The second division was won by Gibraltar. [4]
2002[ edit ]
This tournament was held in Northern Ireland , with Austria replacing Greece from the previous tournament. It was won by the ECB XI . The second division was again won by Gibraltar. [5]
2004[ edit ]
In this year, the two Divisions were played in two different countries. Division One, played in the Netherlands, was again won by the ECB XI, [6] whilst Division Two, played in Belgium was won by Italy. Austria and Portugal did not compete this year, although Norway made their debut in Division Two. [7]
2006[ edit ]
From 2006, the European Cricket Council expanded the tournament to include five divisions of between 4 and 8 teams. By 2009, all five divisions contained six teams.
Division One[ edit ]
The European Division One Championships was held from 4–9 August in Scotland. Five teams participated in a round robin tournament, the games being held in Glasgow and Ayr . The games between Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands had full ODI status. The tournament was won by Ireland, who had also won a 'clean sweep' of European Championship at all age levels. [8]
The top three teams qualified for 2007 WCL Division One , the 4th place for 2007 WCL Division Two and the 5th place for 2007 WCL Division Three .

Education[ edit ]
AB de Villiers attended Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool (Afrikaans High School for Boys, also known as Affies), a public school located in Pretoria. He attended alongside Jacques Rudolph, Heino Kuhn and Francois du Plessis, fellow Titans and South African international cricketers.
Other sports[ edit ]
He is a talented sportsman and has excelled in golf, rugby, badminton, swimming, cricket and tennis. At his school he was part of the school's U-14 cricket team. He played golf at a good level. Rugby was the most followed sport at his school so he took it up too. He once had a flair for hockey and made it to the U-16 side of the school. He was shortlisted for South Africa's junior national hockey team. [7]
He returned to play rugby when he stopped with hockey. He was soon part of the school's rugby team, the 1st XV of the Affies. [8] He performed extraordinarily well and was selected for the Blue Bulls U-18 side, which had some big names that would later represent South African rugby. [9]
Cricket career[ edit ]
De Villiers became the second youngest and second fastest South African to reach 1000 test runs after Graeme Pollock and in his test career so far has batted, bowled and kept wicket as well. Even though he has excelled in other sports, he chose to pursue a career in cricket and, after a spell in the South Africa U19 team, he made his debut for the Titans in 2003/4. He also played for Carrickfergus Cricket Club in Northern Ireland as their overseas player in 2004.
He made his test debut as a 20-year-old on 16 December 2004 against England at Port Elizabeth. He made an impression opening the batting, but was dropped down the order for the second test and also handed the wicket-keeping gloves. In this match, he made a match saving half century from number seven. However, he found himself at the top of the order again for the final test of the series and has played the majority of his tests there.
Despite a good tour of the Caribbean where he scored 178 to help South Africa seal a test series win, his rapid progress was halted on the tour of Australia in 2005. Despite playing Shane Warne well, he struggled and made just 152 runs in 6 innings.
He has been used in a similar fashion to Jonty Rhodes in ODIs, opening the innings, although he currently bats in the middle order. The 2005 ODI tour to India represented a 'coming of age' for De Villiers as a cricketer as he scored his second ODI half century on 24 October 2006, batting 5th in a partnership with Mark Boucher, playing against an impressive Sri Lankan side . De Villiers gave the selectors a sign by producing his then highest one-day score of 92 not out, which included 12 fours and one six, from 98 balls against India in the 2006 winter series.
De Villiers has a reputation as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes as he was also one of the finest fielders of his generation.
In 2009 he was nominated as ICC Cricketer of the year and ICC Test Player of the year.
On 6 June 2011, then S.A. coach Gary Kirsten announced that AB de Villiers will be South Africa's new limited-overs captain, at a news conference. "I'm very excited but I'm also inexperienced. But I've learnt a lot the last seven years from an unbelievable captain," said De Villiers, who has never captained a team at first-class level. "It's a big responsibility, but there'll be a fresh look in the side, which is good."
World Cup 2007[ edit ]
Competing in the 2007 Cricket World Cup he was in career best form in ODIs having scored four 50s during the South Africa vs India/Pakistan (2007) matches.
In the early stages of the tournament his form was poor with three failures including a duck against the Netherlands in a match where his team broke various records for batting. His talent was shown by a 92 in the first round against Australia which was scored in a high-pressure situation. Indeed, it was around the time De Villiers got out (run out from the boundary by Shane Watson ) when South Africa lost their rhythm and went on to lose the game.
His third highest innings to date in ODIs came in the Super 8 game against West Indies on 10 April 2007. He made his maiden ODI hundred, 146 from just 130 balls including 5 sixes and 12 fours. This was despite batting with a runner for the latter stages of his innings and seemingly finding every shot painful due to a combination of cramps, heat exhaustion and dehydration. His innings consisted of a second wicket partnership of 170 with Jacques Kallis and a third wicket partnership of 70 with Herschelle Gibbs the latter of which111 was dominated by De Villiers batting on one leg. De Villiers' innings helped set up a total of 356/4 from 50 overs.
His batting during the world cup was thus at the peaks of both sides since he had also failed to score on 4 occasions, a record in and of itself [10]
2008[ edit ]
On 4 April 2008 he became the first South African to score a double century against India with his top score of 217*.
De Villiers scored an obdurate 174 that helped set up a ten-wicket win for South Africa in the second Test against England at Headingley Carnegie in Leeds in July 2008. This was followed by a 97 at The Oval before he came down the wicket trying to smash Panesar for a boundary and was clean bowled.
Tour of Australia 2008/09[ edit ]
In the first Test in Perth, De Villiers scored a matchwinning century to help South Africa chase down the second highest ever fourth innings target of 414 with six wickets in hand. This was South Africa's first Test victory in Australia in 15 years and appeared to go a long way towards tilting world cricket's balance of power after over a decade of Australian dominance. De Villiers also took four diving catches in the course of the match, including one to dismiss Jason Krejza, a stunner at backward point. [11]
De Villiers only scored 11 runs though in the second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and made another low score in the first innings of the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground . In the second innings of that Test though, De Villiers scored a patient half-century as South Africa almost held on for an against-the-odds draw. [12]
In the 4th ODI in Adelaide he played as wicketkeeper after Boucher was ruled out. He then scored 82 not out from 85 balls with 6 fours and a six to win the series and was named man of the match.
Return series, Johannesburg 2009[ edit ]
AB de Villiers training with South Africa in 2009.
In the first Test at the Wanderers Stadium, De Villiers provided lone resistance in the first innings against a bowling attack led by pace bowler, Mitchell Johnson , scoring 104* of 185 balls with 9 fours and 1 six, whilst his teammates all fell for under 50. But in the second innings he made only 3 of 7.
In the third test, after centuries from Ashwell Prince and Jacques Kallis, De Villiers became the third centurion of the innings with a score of 163 off 196 balls with 12 fours and 7 sixes. This knock also tied the record of most sixes in an over as De Villiers, off a McDonald over, hit four consecutive sixes.
In the following 5 game ODI series, De Villiers played consistently,although starting badly in the first game, scoring only 2 runs. However, he went on to make 36*, 80, 84, and 38, and was named Player of the Series at the conclusion of game 5.
Series against Zimbabwe October 2010[ edit ]
He was rested for the two-match Twenty20 series against Zimbabwe and because Mark Boucher was injured as well Heino Kuhn donned the keeping gloves. De Villiers returned for the ODI series and also took over the gloves while Mark Boucher was recovering. He did well against Zimbabwe scoring two centuries out of the three ODIs as South Africa comfortably won the three match series 3–0.
Against Pakistan in October 2010[ edit ]
His major challenge came against Pakistan for the two Twenty20 matches, where he kept wicket. In the first match he was out for a second-ball duck off a superb delivery by Shoaib Akhtar . In the second T20I he scored 11 runs. He then participated in the five-match ODI series where South Africa were chasing 203 to win and he scored 51 before he was caught and bowled by Saeed Ajmal. In the second ODI he scored 29 as he was bowled by Shahid Afridi ; in the same match a flamboyant Abdul Razzaq played the greatest innings of his life to lift Pakistan to an unbelievable victory. During the third match he scored 19 before he was stumped by Zulqarnain Haider . It turned out to be a mistake by the umpire as he had pressed the wrong button. In the fourth match he missed out on a half-century while on 49 when he gave his wicket to the fielder at point. His good form in the series continued when he scored 61 in the final ODI as South Africa won by 57 runs and the series 3–2.

IPL Spot-Fixing Controversy[ edit ]

(July 2015)
The IPL is no stranger to controversy, but on May 16, 2013 it met arguably its biggest crisis when Delhi Police arrested three Rajasthan Royals players – Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan – soon after their match in Mumbai for spot-fixing. Eleven bookies were also arrested at that time, including one – Amit Singh – who was a former Royals player. Royals later suspended their players and the BCCI set up an inquiry, headed by its ACSU chief Ravi Sawani, into the allegations. The board also announced enhanced anti-corruption measures, including two more security personnel with each team. The arrests kicked off a nationwide search and arrest of bookmakers – betting is illegal in India. One of those picked up in Mumbai was a small-time actor, Virender "Vindoo" Dara Singh, arrested on charges of links with bookmakers. His testimony led the police to arrest, on May 24, 2013, Gurunath Meiyappan , a top official of Chennai Super Kings and son-in-law of BCCI president N Srinivasan. Delhi Police eventually chargesheeted the players, among 39 persons, under sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, while the BCCI handed out life bans to Sreesanth and Chavan after Sawani's probe found them guilty of fixing. On July 14, 2015, a three-member panel—appointed by the Indian Supreme Court , and headed by former Chief Justice RM Lodha —suspended Chennai Super Kings and the Rajasthan Royals for two years. It also banned two club owners, Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra, for life, due to their involvement in betting. These judgements can be considered as the aftermath of previous years' spot-fixing issues. [60] There will be 2 new teams added.
Sundar Raman served as chief operating officer of the league [61] until forced to resign under the cloud of scandal at the end of October 2015. [62] [63]

Personal life
Jadeja was born on 6 December 1988. His father Anirudhsinh was a watchman for a private security agency. His mother Lata died in an accident in 2005. The trauma of his mother's death almost made him quit cricket. His sister Naina is a nurse. [1] He lives in Jamnagar .
Domestic career
Youth career
Jadeja made his first Under-19 appearance for India in 2005 at the age of 16. He was picked in the Indian squad for the 2006 U/19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka. India finished runners-up with Jadeja impressing in the final against Pakistan with a haul of 3 wickets. He was the vice-captain of the victorious Indian team at the 2008 U/19 Cricket World Cup . He played a crucial role with the ball in the tournament, taking 10 wickets in 6 games at an average of 13.
First-class cricket
Jadeja made his first-class debut in the 2006–07 Duleep Trophy. He plays for West Zone in the Duleep Trophy and for Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy .
In 2012, Jadeja became the eighth player in history, and the first Indian player, to score three first-class triple centuries in his career, joining Don Bradman , Brian Lara , Bill Ponsford , Walter Hammond , WG Grace , Graeme Hick and Mike Hussey . His first came in early November 2011 against Orissa , in which he scored 314 off 375 balls. His second came in November 2012 against Gujarat , in which he scored 303 not out. His third came against Railways in December 2012, in which he scored 331 runs in 501 balls. Jadeja reached this milestone at the young age of only 23. [2]
International career
Jadeja caught the attention of the national selectors with his strong all-round showing in the 2008–09 Ranji Trophy – 42 wickets and 739 runs – and was picked for the ODI series in Sri Lanka. His international debut came in the final match of the series on 8 February 2009 where he scored 60*, although India lost the match. In the 2009 World Twenty20, Jadeja was criticized for not scoring fast enough in India's loss to England. After the incumbent all rounder Yusuf Pathan suffered a loss of form, Jadeja took his place at No. 7 in the ODI team in late-2009. In the third ODI against Sri Lanka in Cuttack on 21 December 2009, Jadeja was awarded the man of the match award following a haul of four wickets. His best bowling is 4–32. [3]
He made a comeback into the Indian ODI side in the third ODI against England at The Oval in London. Arriving at the crease with India 58–5 after 19 overs, he scored 78, adding 112 with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni and 59 off only 5.1 overs with Ravichandran Ashwin to help his side reach 234–7 in 50 overs. He also took 2–42 from his 9 overs and was named "player of the match", but England won the rain-affected game. His performance in the fourth ODI at Lord's was mixed: he gave away four crucial overthrows with a poor throw from the boundary, but then took a brilliant catch on the boundary off the last ball. [4]
In the second T20I of the Australian tour in February 2012, Jadeja had figures of 1/16 in 3 overs and effected two run outs in the Australian innings. India went on to win the game and Jadeja was awarded Man of the Match, mainly for his fielding efforts. [5]
After his impressive performance at the start of Ranji Trophy season 2012–13 in which he scored two 300+ scores in 4 matches (4/125 and then 303* against Gujarat at Surat ; 331 and 3/109 against Railways at Rajkot in the Ranji Trophy 2012–13), he was called up to join the 15-member India Test team to play the fourth Test against England at Nagpur . [6] In his Test debut against England at Nagpur, he bowled 70 overs and picked 3/117. [7]
During the second ODI in the India-England series at Kochi, Jadeja smashed 61 off just 37 balls which took India to a total of 285. In the second innings he bowled a remarkable spell of 2 for 12 in 7 overs helping India beat England by 127 runs and level the series 1–1. This performance earned Jadeja the Man of the Match award.
In the historic 4–0 home Test series win against Australia in February–March 2013, Jadeja took 24 wickets, dismissing the Australian captain Michael Clarke five out of six times in the series which cemented his place in the team as an all-rounder despite not contributing much with the bat. His seven-wicket haul including a five-for in the second innings of the final Test match earned him the Man of the Match award. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] He played an important role for India in lifting the ICC Champions Trophy 2013.He made 33* with bat and took 2 wickets in the final against England.
He is ranked as the No.1 bowler in ODI Cricket by the ICC in August 2013. Jadeja is the first India bowler to top the rankings since Anil Kumble, who topped the table in 1996. He is the fourth India bowler after Kapil Dev, Maninder Singh and Kumble to be ranked No. 1. [13]
Jadeja scored his maiden test fifty on 20 July 2014 playing against England saving the match for India who were struggling at 235/7. He made 68 runs from just 57 balls. His parternership of 99 with Bhuvneshwar Kumar helped India set England a target of 319.
Indian Premier League
Ravindra Jadeja was selected by the Rajasthan Royals for the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008, and played an important role in their victory (Royals defeated Chennai Super Kings in the final). Jadeja scored 135 runs from 14 matches at a strike rate of 131.06, his best score being 36* against Kings XI Punjab . He did even better in 2009 , scoring 295 runs at a strike rate of 110.90, [14] and conceding fewer than 6.5 runs per over. [15] Shane Warne , the captain of Rajasthan Royals, referred to Jadeja as a "superstar in the making". [16] Warne also nicknamed him "Rockstar". [17]
Jadeja sat out the 2010 IPL because of a ban arising from contractual irregularities. [18] In 2011 , he was bought by the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for $950,000. Kochi Tuskers were terminated from the IPL in September 2011, and in the 2012 IPL player auction , Jadeja was bought by Chennai Super Kings for $2 million (approx. Rs. 9.8 crore) after a tie-breaker with Deccan Chargers who bid the same amount. Jadeja was the most expensive player of the year's auction. [19] He won the Man of the Match award in the second match of the season against Deccan Chargers for his all-round performance (48 runs off 44 balls, 1/38 in 4 overs). [20]
Ravindra Jadeja playing for Chennai Super king had fine spin bowling performance in Chennai for an IPL 2015 Match on Mother's Day; He took four wickets for 11 runs with a brilliant spell of spin attack against Rajasthan Royals.
Praise
Sunil Gavaskar said in March 2013 that Ravindra Jadeja, along with Cheteshwar Pujara , was a role model for youngsters. [21] Jadeja's contributions in India's 4–0 test series win over Australia in February and March 2013 were praised in the media, [22] and Gavaskar called him one of the architects of the win. [21] Jadeja's dominance of Clarke was also praised in the media. [23] Jadeja was named Player of the Week by the portal Cricket World after the end of the fourth test. [24]
Online sarcasm and jokes
Since his performance at the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 event, Jadeja has been a consistent target of sarcasm and jokes by cricket portals and Indian cricket fans. [22] On Twitter and Facebook, he is jokingly referred to as Sir Ravindra Jadeja since an online joke calling him the same went viral. [22] [25] When Jadeja was out clean bowled for 16 while not offering a shot in the February 2013 Chennai test against Australia, a cricket portal described his dismissal as "Jadeja falls 284 runs short of what would have been a fourth first-class triple-century". [22] Following his good performance against Australia in the 2013 test series, there was a flurry of Jadeja jokes on Twitter comparing him to Rajinikanth . [26] [27] [28] His Wikipedia article was temporarily vandalized to mock him. [25] [29] [30] [31] In April 2013, Mahendra Singh Dhoni , Suresh Raina and Ravichandran Ashwin , teammates of Jadeja in Chennai Super Kings , tweeted several Jadeja jokes on Twitter, in one of which Dhoni referred to him as Sri Sri Pandit Sir Lord Ravindra Jadeja. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] In response, Jadeja said in April 2013 that it was a joke which everybody was enjoying, and that he had no problem with the prefix Sir. [36] [37]

The outgoing India bowling coach talks about the development of Ishant Sharma and Sreesanth, Umesh Yadav's future and the highlights of his stint

Eric Simons says he worked on getting Ishant's pace back, and getting him to bowl a fuller length © AFP
Eric Simons is approaching the end of his term as bowling coach of India. It hurts him that early reports suggested he was sacked, or, to use popular parlance, "the first casualty of the two whitewashes". Had the results of his work as bowling coach been more conspicuous, he may not have minded such suggestions as much. There are contrasting views on Simons. The players all praise him, which is why his contract was extended in the first place. Outsiders look at the likes of Ishant Sharma and Sreesanth , and conclude that their apparent lack of progress is Simons' failure.
In what was, in all likelihood, Simons' final press conference as India bowling coach, he spoke at length about various issues and bowlers. He disagrees with the notion that Ishant does not know how to take wickets. He insists Ishant has worked on his game, bowling six to 18 inches fuller on the Australia tour than he previously did, and that he has been unlucky.
He says Sreesanth is one of the most skilled bowlers he has worked with, but the fact that he could not inculcate consistency in him was something that disappointed him. Contributing to the World Cup win is a cherished achievement, as is helping Ishant regain his pace. Here are some excerpts from the press conference.
How has your overall experience been?
I don't want it to sound like a cliché, but it has been an incredible experience for me. I hoped to come along and teach some cricketers some things, to share some input, but I think one of the incredible things was that it was a learning experience for me, not only as a cricketer but as a person.
Is Ishant unlucky or does he not know how to take wickets?
It's a funny one. In one of the first series [of my tenure] versus South Africa, in the Test we won in Kolkata, he bowled brilliantly but didn't get the rewards he deserved. You could see his frustration. To me, he is one of the unluckiest bowlers in the sense that for how well he bowls, and the number of wicket-taking balls he bowls, he just doesn't seem to pick up the wickets I believe - and everyone else believes - he deserves.
We know that the Australians were pleased he wasn't involved in the one-day series. He bowled so well [in the Tests], he was the one that troubled them. Morne Morkel is a similar bowler to Ishant [they are both tall]; he also bowls really well but doesn't pick up the number of wickets we expect him to. For Ishant to hit the stumps, he has to pitch it fuller, and that means the batsman has more chance of keeping it out. He has to find the right mix of deliveries to bowl.
Can one be unlucky for so long?
In the past, maybe you could make the point that he was not really that unlucky; but in the series against Australia, the nick that went between Laxman and Dhoni, the balls that looped and dropped safe, ones that hit the splice and did not go to hand, they were really down to poor luck. I really think in this series Ishant kicked on a long way in terms of the number of wicket-taking deliveries he bowled. I really do believe he was unlucky. I hope he is not discouraged. I hope Indian cricket sticks with him. They have got an incredible cricketer in him.
It's believed that if he can pitch the ball a couple of feet fuller, he will create nicks and not just go past the bat …
We found that his length in Australia was a good six to 18 inches fuller than what used to be his regular length. We worked on getting his length right. It is not always that easy, you know. I think the movement he is now getting, both away from the batsman and back in, is going to make a difference.
He wants to play one-day cricket. Should he?
When I arrived, opinion was that focusing on Tests would be best for his development, and I think he was happy with that. At that stage that was probably the right decision. Personally, I believe he is ready for one-day cricket now. I think he is bowling exceptionally well. It is all about control and confidence. But I am not part of the selection process. You are at the nets, you know the guy, you know he is ready and when to let him go, and when not to. Maybe being conservative with Ishant is the way the selectors want to go. I think he is ready, but that's the selectors' decision. I'll live with that.
You were so impressed with Munaf Patel. Why wasn't he given a chance in the Tests in England. He even lost out to an out-of-shape RP Singh
When RP Singh came back into the side, the point I made was that, because we didn't have anyone who could bowl at 145kph, we had to be innovative and clever in the way we put our attack together. The thinking was that if you lost someone like Zak [Zaheer Khan], you wanted someone a little bit different. That counted in someone like RP's favour.
If you have bowlers who are all similar then the batsman never has to change his angle or think differently. It was a pity Munaf didn't play because he played a major role in the World Cup success. It's not always what he has done in terms of wickets, but what he allows the other players to do.

What do you make of Sreesanth's progress?
One of the best things about being involved with Indian cricket is the high skill-level of the players. I have not met someone with the skill of Sreesanth. He bowled a spell to the Australians in Bangalore, when the ball was reversing, and I said to him: "there are maybe one or two bowlers in the world that can do that." His skills are phenomenal.
Unfortunately the way the batsmen are today, the way the game has evolved, you need a lot more than that. You need consistency. That's something I have tried to impart. There is no point in bowling three or four good balls in an over, and then letting the batsmen off the hook. That's the evolution of a bowler, to stop doing that. You watch Ben Hilfenhaus. His plan was very simple and was very successful too. Sometimes having a very simple gameplan that you can execute really well is better than having too many options.
But one of the biggest criticisms of you is that Sreesanth and Ishant haven't evolved …
Cricket is a package. Sometimes great cricketers are not the ones with tremendous skills, but those with a great work ethic. For a guy like Sree, I am disappointed.
I disagree about Ishant, though. The criticism I got was that he was bowling 130-132kph. We needed the pace back. In this series against Australia he was bowling at 140-plus again. Our attack was probably quicker than the Australian attack, which is quite unusual for an Indian attack. We have got back the pace, I think it's now about developing the tactical perspective.
How do you see Umesh Yadav going?
I watch Umesh with great excitement. I started working with him two years ago, at the Delhi Daredevils. So often on television people say his wrist is collapsing. To me that's commentary. How you fix it is coaching. He was given drills two years ago, and he has performed them diligently.
He is now bowling this beautiful away swing at 145kph-plus, he is an incredible athlete, and he has got incredible stamina and strength. I think he is one of those bowlers who, when he bowls 145kph, makes the batsmen feel like it is 150 because he is so relaxed in his run-up and has such a rhythmical action. I just think, as he grows and understands his craft better, he is going to get better. He is one of the most exciting bowlers in the world today, not just in India.
Have you warned him of case studies of young Indian bowlers before him who have lost pace?
I talk to him about what I believe he has got to do. I don't know what happened with other young bowlers. Each one is going to have different stories about what happened and what didn't happen.
How has it been working with Zaheer, who has been in and out of the side?
One of the things that is very encouraging is how fit Zaheer is looking at the moment and how excited he is about playing cricket again. He is a player with great skill, and I think he has a big role to play in mentoring the cricketers and bowlers around him because he has a very good understanding of his craft, and he has the ability to teach that. He is working hard physically to make sure he is available as much as he possibly can be, and I think that's where the key lies.
What about the spinners?
R Ashwin has been bowling really well. He has grown a lot as a bowler. [Pragyan] Ojha has grown as a bowler; we've talked a lot about the seam bowlers, but he has grown leaps and bounds as a cricketer and as a bowler. It was a pity that he wasn't able to play a bigger role in our team make-up [in Australia]. We weren't able to pick two spinners.
What is your biggest achievement as India's bowling coach?
It's sometimes difficult to measure progress from the outside, but I see the growth of some of the cricketers. Sometimes when you are in the nets, you just know that the guy with you is not ready and needs help; a journalist sitting on the side may not see it, but you see it in the player's eyes, in his confidence. I've helped people like that; people like R Vinay Kumar, even Praveen Kumar, who was obviously a more established cricketer, but grew as well. Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav are players I am very excited about.
It's more about individuals growing as cricketers and people. I think from that perspective I'll walk away feeling that I've made some contribution, and take some pleasure and enjoyment out of that. Then there's the World Cup of course.
What are your future plans?
I've been appointed head coach of the Delhi Daredevils, so that'll be my next assignment in the cricketing world. I've got business in Cape Town, and that's where I go back after the IPL. A few people have spoken to me, but I haven't made a decision yet.

Domestic career[ edit ]
Rahul made his debut in the 2010-11 season, playing first-class cricket for Karnataka . He made his debut in Indian Premier League in 2014, playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad . [1]
Playing for South Zone in the final of the 2014–15 Duleep Trophy against Central Zone, Rahul scored 185 off 233 balls in the first innings and 130 off 152 balls in the second. Although his contribution went in vain with S the nine matches he played.
International career[ edit ]
After an excellent domestic season in 2014, Rahul was picked in the Indian Test squad for the Australian tour . He made his Test Debut in the Boxing Day Test Match beginning on 26 December 2014 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . He replaced Rohit Sharma and was handed over the Test cap by MS Dhoni . He come to bat at no. 6 and made 3 runs in the first inning. In the second inning he played at no. 3 and made only 1 run. He retained his place for the fourth test played at Sydney Cricket Ground . He open the inning with Murali Vijay and made 110 runs, his maiden International hundred.
He was a part of 15-man squad for the tour of Bangladesh in June 2015 but later withdrew due to dengue fever. He then made a comeback into the Test team in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour after Murali Vijay was ruled out due to a hamstring injury. But he did not show any progress in the first match where he got out early in both innings for less than 10 runs. In the second match of the series, Shikhar Dhawan lost his place due to injury and ruled out from the rest of the tour. So, Rahul got a chance to show his talents once again where he made his second Test century of 108 runs from 190 balls inculdingde Brian Lara so captivating to watch

What might Sachin Tendulkar have done outside of a culture so obsessed with the individual?
© AFP
 
For Brian Charles Lara, the moment to capture in sepia came against one of the game's all-time greats. When Glenn McGrath drifted on to the pads on a belter of a pitch at the Adelaide Oval , Lara worked him down to fine leg for the single that took him past Allan Border on the all-time run-scorers' list. The record was the perfect way to end an Australian adventure that began with a sublime 277 at the SCG 12 years earlier.
Anonymous in the first two Tests of the series, Lara came alive on a pristine batting surface at one of the most beautiful grounds in the world. By the time he put AB in the shade, he had already gone past 200. The 226 that he finished with would have been a fitting farewell note to Australia if not for the fact that his second-innings failure and the seven-wicket defeat encapsulated the frailties that had seen the West Indies' star wane even as Lara continued to shine.
There was no legend confronting Sachin Tendulkar at the PCA Stadium the first ball after tea. The clock had just ticked past 2:30 when Peter Siddle set off on his long run to the bowling crease. A bustling workhorse rather than a pace thoroughbred, Siddle had done little wrong the first two sessions, but when the first ball of the third was pitched a touch too wide of off stump, Tendulkar opened the face and steered it down to third man as he'd done so many times before. Three runs scampered and history made, a generation after a similar stroke, albeit off an offspinner, took Sunil Gavaskar into hitherto uninhabited 10,000-run land.
The autumns of the two batting patriarchs of our age couldn't have been more different though. The last five years of Lara's career saw a batsman at ease with the world, freed of the burden that he had lugged around for a decade. The haplessness of those around him was probably a factor. Stadiums that were once island fortresses were easily breached by visiting sides, and away from home, West Indies had a record every bit as depressing as that of Bangladesh. With the team winning next to nothing and seldom coming close, Lara went out and expressed himself. In those 34 Tests, he averaged 57.50, well over his career figure, while scoring a staggering 13 centuries.
There was always something of the Caribbean joie de vivre in Lara's batting, an air of the carnival that brings his native Trinidad to a standstill. Even his Australian swansong was indicative of that, with the 226 runs amassed from just 298 balls in truly buccaneering fashion. The team may have been mediocre beyond belief, but Lara refused to be shackled by their limitations.
Tendulkar's journey took him in a very different direction. An often-solitary beacon capable of ravishing strokeplay when in his pomp, he has seldom enthralled over the past half decade. Injuries undoubtedly played a part, as did the fact that he was no longer the fulcrum of India's batting push. Virender Sehwag scored quicker, Rahul Dravid looked more resolute and VVS Laxman more elegant. And as India finally became a half-decent side away from home, the focus shifted to individual milestones. He has ticked them off one by one - 10,000 runs against Pakistan at the Eden Gardens in 2005, the 35th century that took him past Gavaskar (against Sri Lanka in Delhi in 2005) and now this.
 
 
Long before he even turned 30 though, Tendulkar had ceased to be just a cricketer. For a developing nation, aspiration is the name of the game but even then the expectations of him were so outré as to be ridiculous
 
Along the way, the audacious strokeplayer of old emerged from hibernation now and then, notably at Sydney and Adelaide last January, when you could glimpse the teenager who caught Sir Donald Bradman's eye with centuries at the SCG and the WACA. For the most part though, he became an efficient accumulator, albeit with troughs that were so uncommon during the halcyon years.
Long before he even turned 30 though, Tendulkar had ceased to be just a cricketer. For a developing nation, aspiration is the name of the game but even then the expectations of him were so outré as to be ridiculous. His life became reality TV, and all that was needed was the Police to reassemble and sing Every Breath You Take for the soundtrack. Newspapers would publish illustrations from Grey's Anatomy, while TV anchors would steel themselves to say "superior labral antero posterior tear".
Lara's failures, and there were a few given his cavalier style, evoked some disappointment, but never the sort of viciousness that accompanied a Tendulkar setback. It makes you wonder how many more runs he might have made had he lived in a country that didn't specialise in headlines like Endulkar, and where every other TV debate chaired by some stiff didn't ask the profound question: Is he past his best?
What might he have done outside of a culture so obsessed with the individual? Even the landmarks appeared to become troublesome chores rather than milestones to be bypassed as a matter of course. And even as he remained an intensely private person, an entire parallel universe was constructed around him, full of inane trivia such as a fondness for milk laced with turmeric at breakfast.
The career graph dipped, as it inevitably does even with the all-time greats, but he was still good enough to score 494 runs in Australia last winter. And until Siddle summoned up a fine delivery with the second new ball, he was on course for a tenth century against the team that have set the standards for most of his 19 years at the top.
Perhaps now, with all the records behind him, he can enjoy a second childhood and bat with something of the insouciance that made Lara so captivating to watch. Such comparisons are unfair though. If Lara's career was It's a Wonderful Life, Tendulkar's has been a Kieslowski, shot painstakingly and sometimes weighed down by the cares of the world. We're fortunate to have watched them both.

Asad Rauf was a right-hand batsman who enjoyed a solid if unspectacular career in the 1980s, which his best season coming in 1986-87 when he made 672 runs at 35.36, including one hundred and five fifties. But he lost form the following season and played little first-class cricket thereafter. His career as an umpire really started in 1998 when he made his first-class debut, and in 2000 he stood in his first ODI.  He was elevated to the ODI panel in 2004 and officiated in his first Test the following year. In April 2006 he was appointed to the ICC Elite Panel.

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali October 16, 2008
Elbow injury forces Clark out of second Test

After a tiring first Test Australia enter the second game with a few significant creaks and another new player in Victoria's Peter Siddle. While the teams still debate who came out on top following the opening draw, one thing that isn't in doubt is some major and minor concerns for the tourists.
The main problem is they have lost fast bowler Stuart Clark to a right elbow injury after he failed a fitness test on Thursday. He had an injection in the arm but it did not help and Siddle's entry means Australia will have four players - Shane Watson, Brad Haddin, Cameron White and Siddle - who have played fewer than five Tests.
Despite the setbacks, Ponting is confident of a strong showing. "There was a lot made of the inexperience factor coming here, but all those inexperienced guys showed they are more than capable of performing well at international level," Ponting said. "There's no doubt it's easier for us guys who have played a bit, particularly in this part of the world."
Ponting expects a "hard slog" on a pitch that he thinks will suit India's spinners and he has been impressed with the efforts of Siddle on tour. Siddle is 23 and has 43 wickets in only 12 first-class appearances, winning a spot ahead of the left-armer Doug Bollinger.
"It's disappointing for Stuart," Siddle said, "but I'm really pleased to be called up for my country and to get the chance to the wear the baggy green. I'm looking forward to the challenge of bowling to the top order."
Ponting said Siddle was a "no-nonsense guy and a no-nonsense sort of bowler". "He's got good pace and a good presence," Ponting said. "He will keep running in for you. He bowled beautifully in the nets [on Wednesday] and I just like the way he goes about it."
Ponting is not in danger of missing the match, but he is taking anti-inflammatory tablets to help ease a nagging wrist complaint following surgery after the West Indies series. Australia also have a couple of underperforming batsmen in Hayden and Clarke, who made 30 runs between them in the first Test.
 
 
"The spinners took only 3 for 350 in the game," Ponting said, "showing we can manage their bowlers in these conditions."
 
Both have been spending a long time batting at training this week trying to iron out the problems. Hayden is returning from a heel injury that ruled him out of the West Indies series while Clarke had a stomach problem in the lead-up to Bangalore.
"It's about how you come back and respond, and Matthew was in the nets for an hour-and-a-half yesterday working on different things, making sure he got his volume of work done," Ponting said. "Michael Clarke was the same, so it's good to see the guys who missed out in the Test are taking it upon themselves to get stuck in and get their batting work up."
India are waiting on Anil Kumble's fitness and Australia have been boosted by his poor form in Bangalore and their strong showing against him and Harbhajan Singh. "The spinners took only 3 for 350 in the game," Ponting said, "showing we can manage their bowlers in these conditions."
The Mohali pitch spent time under the covers again on Thursday morning due to light rain, but despite the extra moisture Ponting does not expect it to help the fast bowlers. "I don't think there's going to be much assistance for the quicks at all," he said. "I saw the groundsman interviewed on TV and he said he made the wicket to suit their spinners. It could be a long, hard slog for us in the field, but we're well equipped to cope with these conditions, as we have in the past."

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 4th day October 20, 2008
Gambhir reaches the elusive century

Gautam Gambhir: "There was a lot of pressure on me. I really wanted to establish myself in Test cricket"

On the first day in Mohali, India passed milestone after milestone: Sachin Tendulkar became Test cricket's highest run-scorer and took his tally past 12,000, while Sourav Ganguly notched up 7000. Such records inevitably fall by the wayside during long enough careers. There was one milestone, however, that was missed by India, and also by Gautam Gambhir.
Gambhir had attacked Australia on a flat pitch and had pushed the field back but, when the century was there for the taking, he got bogged down and wasted the opportunity. It wasn't the first time either for, since his comeback, Gambhir has looked good for a hundred at least four times, without actually getting one. He came into this Test averaging 36 which isn't bad but it doesn't do justice to the kind of form he's been in. And openers averaging 36 aren't rated much either.
Simply put, he needed a century. When openers are judged, and when they're selected or dropped, it's the hundreds that count. The near-misses are forgotten for they are merely starts which haven't been converted. And Gambhir had only one century to show for his 18 Tests.
"It was always playing on my mind, that I was getting starts but not converting them," Gambhir said completing his second Test century. "Everyone was telling me that I was just getting 60s and 70s. Today the only thing different was that I just tried to be in the present. Those 60s and 70s had happened in the past; I thought it better to just think about each ball."
He looked comfortable in the first innings. He drove balls bowled at speeds approaching 150km with authority but, after shifting to fourth gear, he switched back to first and got stuck. There was a sense that he was perhaps wasting the best form of his life.
"It was very frustrating. In Test cricket it's important to get big runs," Gambhir said. "It's not like you will be getting starts in each game and each innings; there will be times when you will get out early. The important thing, whenever you get a good start, is to get as many runs as possible."
Gambhir's comeback to the Test team was via the Twenty20 and one-day route, formats in which he's thrived and scored runs, even against Australia. However, he knows that Test cricket is the real deal.
"You always want people to remember you as a good Test cricketer, rather than just a good one-day cricketer or a Twenty20 cricketer," Gambhir said. "There was a lot of pressure on me. I really wanted to establish myself in Test cricket. Today was a very important knock for me, a Test century against Australia"
His reaction upon reaching the century said as much. He clipped Cameron White towards the midwicket boundary and started celebrating even before completing the single that would take him to 100. The fist-pumping was exaggerated and portrayed the great relief of a burden being lifted.
Rarely does one get a second chance soon but Australia offered him the driver's seat again. The third ball of his second innings was full and wide and Gambhir freed his arms and square drove it. Soon he started walking down the wicket and toyed with the bowlers.
Boundaries alone, however, weren't enough against this Australian side. They knew their weaknesses and were quick to go on the defensive. Gambhir's century was compiled under circumstances similar to the middle overs of a 50-over game and he looked for quick singles and tried converting ones into twos. Having Virender Sehwag at the other end during most of his innings helped immensely for Gambhir and Sehwag are a perfect cricket marriage. They are friends off the field and on it. Both are aggressive although in different ways. Their understanding is so good that calling is redundant; eye contact is often enough.
"I always have extra confidence when Viru [Sehwag] is batting at the other end," Gambhir said. "It is always difficult when you are playing the new ball. He is one person you can share your thoughts with. So far it has been working out well."
Another of Gambhir's good friends is only one Test old. Amit Mishra plays for ONGC, the same club as Gambhir and Sehwag. Mishra has spent years feeling happy about his friend's inclusion in the national side. "I used to sit in front of the TV set in hope that maybe this time my name would be there. But it was only Gautam's name that would bring a smile on my face, the only saving grace." It is fitting that Gambhir should have cemented his place in the same match that Mishra took a five-wicket haul on debut.

Brave entry
In hi 14 fours and 1 six. India finally went on to win the match to level the series and Rahul named as the man of the match. His wicket keeping skills came in handy, when saha got injured, Rahul took a spectacular catch to dismiss Mathews in the second innings, who was doing well throughout the series hence his catch proved to be game changing. [2]
Personal life[ edit ]
Rahul hails from Mangalore . Rahul's father, KN Lokesh, who is originally from Kannur village in Magadi taluk in Ramanagara district , is a professor of Civil Engineering at the NITK , Mangalore . His mother, Rajeshwari, is an associate professor at Mangalore University ’s undergraduate college. [3]
Rahul's father, who was a big fan of Sunil Gavaskar , wanted to name him after Gavaskar's son but mistook the name of Gavaskar's son 'Rohan' as 'Rahul'. [4]

In 2009, Ireland stated its intention to apply for Full Membership of the ICC with the aim of achieving Test status, [11] and restated its intention in 2012, but the 2012 plan aims to achieve Test status by 2020,. [12]
In 2014, the ICC announced the introduction of the ICC Test Challenge, which will see the holder of the Intercontinental Cup play a pair of two five-day match series against the lowest ranked test-playing nation every four years, starting in 2018. [13]
Conduct of the game[ edit ]
See also: Playing time (cricket)
The times of sessions and intervals may be altered in certain circumstances: if bad weather or a change of innings occurs close to a scheduled break, the break may be taken immediately; if there has been a loss of playing time, for example because of bad weather, the session times may be adjusted to make up the lost time; if the batting side is nine wickets down at the scheduled tea break, then the interval may be delayed until either 30 minutes has elapsed or the team is all out; [14] the final session may be extended by up to 30 minutes if 90 or more overs have not been bowled in that day's play (subject to any reduction for adverse weather); [15] the final session may be extended by 30 minutes (except on the 5th day) if the umpires believe the result can be decided within that time. [16]
In the early days of Test cricket, matches were played for four days. Until the 1980s, it was usual to include a 'rest day,' often a Sunday. There have also been ' Timeless Tests ', which did not end after a predetermined maximum time. In 2005, Australia played a six-day match against a World XI, which the ICC sanctioned as an official Test match even though the match reached a conclusion on the fourth day.
There have been attempts by the ICC, the sport's governing body, to introduce day-night Test Matches. [17] In 2012, The International Cricket Council passed playing conditions that allowed for the staging of day-night Test matches. [7] The first day-night Test is scheduled to take place on New Zealand's tour to Australia in November 2015. [8]
Further information: Cricket § Rules and game-play
Test cricket is played in innings (the word denotes both the singular and the plural). In each innings, one team bats and the other bowls (or fields ). Ordinarily four innings are played in a Test match, and each team bats twice and bowls twice. Before the start of play on the first day, the two team captains and the match referee toss a coin ; the captain who wins the toss decides whether his team will bat or bowl first.
In the following scenarios, the team that bats first is referred to as Team A and their opponents as Team B.
Usually the teams will alternate at the completion of each innings. Thus, Team A will bat (and Team B will bowl) until its innings ends, and then Team B will bat and Team A will bowl. When Team B's innings ends, Team A begin their second innings, and this is followed by Team B's second innings. The winning team is the one that scores more runs in their two innings.
A team's innings ends in one of the following ways: [18]
The team is "all out". This typically occurs when a team has lost ten wickets (ten of the eleven batsmen having been dismissed ) and are "bowled out". It may occasionally occur with the loss of fewer wickets if one or more batsmen are unavailable to bat (through injury, for example).
The team's captain declares the innings closed, usually because they believe they have enough runs. A declaration before the innings starts is called an innings forfeiture.
The team batting fourth score the required number of runs to win.
The prescribed time for the match expires.
If, at the completion of its first innings, Team B's first innings total is 200 or more fewer than Team A's, the captain of Team A may (but is not required to) order Team B to have their second innings next. This is called enforcing the follow on . [19] In this case, the usual order of the third and fourth innings is reversed: Team A will bat in the fourth innings. It is rare for a team forced to follow on to win the match. In Test cricket it has only happened three times, although over 285 follow-ons have been enforced: Australia was the losing team on each occasion, twice to England, in 1894 and in 1981, and once to India in 2001. [20]
If the whole of the first day's play of a test match has been lost because of bad weather, then Team A may enforce the follow on if Team B's first innings total is 150 or more fewer than Team A's. During the 2nd test between England and New Zealand at Headingley, Leeds, 24–28 May 2013, England batted first after the first day was lost because of rain. [21] New Zealand, batting second, scored 180 runs fewer than England, meaning England could have enforced the follow on, though chose not to. This is similar to four-day first class cricket, where the follow on can be enforced if the difference is 150 runs or fewer.
After 80 overs, the captain of the bowling side may take a new ball , although this is not required. [22] The captain will usually take the new ball: being harder and smoother than an old ball, a new ball generally favours faster bowlers who can make it bounce more variably. The roughened, softer surface of an old ball can be more conducive to spin bowlers, or those using reverse swing . The captain may delay the decision to take the new ball if he wishes to continue with his spinners (because the pitch favours spin). After a new ball has been taken, should an innings last a further 80 overs, then the captain will have the option to take another new ball.
A Test match may end in one of six results :
All four innings are complete. The team batting fourth are all out before overtaking the other team, usually before matching the other team's score. The team that batted third are the winners by a margin equal to the difference in the aggregate runs scored by the two teams (for example, "Team A won by 95 runs"). Very rarely (in over 2,000 Test matches played, it has only happened twice ) the scores can end level, resulting in a tie .
The team batting in the fourth innings overtakes the opposing team's run total. The match ends, and the team batting fourth is the winner by a margin equal to the number of wickets still to fall in the innings (for example, "Team B won by five wickets").
The third innings concludes with the team that batted twice still trailing the team that batted once. The match ends without playing a fourth innings. The team that batted only once is the winner by a margin equal to "an innings" plus the difference in aggregate run totals of the teams (for example, "Team B won by an innings and 26 runs").
Time for the match expires without a result being reached. This usually occurs at the end of the last day of the match. The result is a draw : there is no winner, no matter how superior the position of one of the sides. Rain causing a loss of playing time is a common factor in drawn matches, although matches may be drawn even without interference from the weather: usually as a result of poor time management or an intentional effort on the part of one team to avoid losing.
The match is abandoned because the ground is declared unfit for play. This has occurred three times, resulting each time in a draw being declared: England v Australia at Headingley , Leeds , 1975 (vandalism); [23] West Indies v England at Sabina Park , Kingston, Jamaica , 1998 (dangerous ground); [24] West Indies v England at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium , Antigua , 2009 (dangerous ground). [25]
The match is awarded through a forfeiture. If a team refuses to take the field of play, the umpires may award the match to the opposing team. [26] This has only happened once in Test cricket, in the 2006 Fourth Test between England and Pakistan . [27] [28]
Competitions[ edit ]
Test cricket is almost always played as a series of matches between two countries, with all matches in the series taking place in the same country (the host). Often there is a perpetual trophy that is awarded to the winner, the most famous of which is the Ashes contested between England and Australia. There have been two exceptions to the bilateral nature of Test cricket: the 1912 Triangular Tournament , a three-way competition between England, Australia and South Africa (hosted by England), and the Asian Test Championship , an event held in 1998–99 and 2001–02.
The number of matches in Test series has varied from one to seven. [29]
Up until the early 1990s, [30] Test series between international teams were organised between the two national cricket organisations with umpires provided by the home team. With the entry of more countries into Test cricket, and a wish by the ICC to maintain public interest in Tests in the face of the popularity of one-day cricket , a rotation system was introduced that sees all ten Test teams playing each other over a six-year cycle, and an official ranking system (with a trophy held by the highest-ranked team). In this system, umpires are provided by the ICC. An elite panel of eleven umpires has been established, and the panel is supplemented by an additional International Panel that includes three umpires named by each Test-playing country. The elite umpires officiate almost all Test matches (usually not a Test involving their home country); the International Panel is only employed when the cricketing calendar is filled with activity, or for one-day internationals (ODIs).

Sides designated as "England" began to play in the late 18th century, but these teams were not truly representative. Early international cricket was disrupted by the French Revolution and the American Civil War . The earliest international cricket match was between USA and Canada , on 24 and 25 September 1844. [31] This has never been officially considered a "Test match". Tours of national English sides abroad took place, particularly to the USA, Australia and New Zealand. The Australian Aborigines team became the first organised overseas cricketers to tour England in 1868 .
Two rival English tours of Australia were proposed in the early months of 1877, with James Lillywhite campaigning for a professional tour and Fred Grace for an amateur one. Grace's tour fell through and it was Lillywhite's team that toured New Zealand and Australia in 1876–77. Two matches against a combined Australian XI were later classified as the first official Test matches. The first match was won by Australia, by 45 runs, and the second by England. After reciprocal tours established a pattern of international cricket, The Ashes was established as an ongoing competition during the Australian tour of England in 1882. Surprisingly beaten, a mock obituary of English cricket was published in the Sporting Times the following day: the phrase "The body shall be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia" prompted the subsequent creation of the Ashes urn. The series of 1884–85 was the first to be held over five matches: Shaw, writing in 1901, considered the side to be "the best ever to have left England".
The first Test series not to involve Australia occurred in 1888–89, as an understrength England side toured South Africa.



Most Runs: Ian Bell ENG – 247, Most Wickets: Mitchell Starc AUS – 12
Notable moments in the Australian Tri-Series[ edit ]
1979–80 – The match on 27 November 1979 between Australia and West Indies in Sydney was the first official One Day International to be played at night. Like the tri-series concept itself, night matches were a World Series Cricket initiative that was adopted into ODI cricket.
1979–80 – England defeated West Indies by two runs in Sydney when, West Indies requiring three runs to win from the final ball of the match, England captain Mike Brearley pushed all of his fieldsmen, including the wicket-keeper, back to the boundary. ODI rules were changed to incorporate fielding restrictions to prevent any repeat of this incident.
Trevor Chappell bowls underarm to Brian McKechnie in the 3rd Final of 1980–81 WSC
1980–81 – In the third final, with New Zealand needing six runs from the final ball to tie the match, Australian captain Greg Chappell ordered his younger brother, Trevor to bowl the ball underarm along the ground. This was one of cricket's most controversial moments of all time. ODI laws were changed so that any ball delivered underarm would be called a no-ball.
1981–82 – In the final qualifying match, Australia defeated West Indies at Sydney on run-rate after rain washed out the last 6.5 overs of the match; the Melbourne Age newspaper later alleged that West Indies had deliberately lost the match to ensure that Australia got to the finals series ahead of Pakistan, which would result in a gain of $800,000 to the Australian Cricket Board in extra gate takings. West Indian captain Clive Lloyd won a libel action and $100,000 in damages against the newspaper.
1982–83 – New Zealand breaks the world record for the highest successful run chase in an ODI, scoring 297–6 to surpass England's 296–5 in Adelaide . The record stood until 1992. [16]
1982–83 – In the second final at Melbourne versus Australia, New Zealander Lance Cairns scored the then World record fastest ODI fifty off 21 balls, hitting 6 sixes. This is the still currently the fastest 50 in Australian Tri-Series matches. [17]
1983–84 – The first ever tied One-day International took place in the second final at the MCG between Australia and West Indies , after Carl Rackemann was run out attempting the winning run.
1984–85 – West Indies were the first team to go through the qualifying round unbeaten by winning all 10 matches. Although they lost the first match v Australia, they came back from behind to win the finals series 2–1. [18]
1985–86 – After having clinched a finals berth, Australia was defeated by New Zealand by 206 runs in Adelaide after being bowled out for 70. This remains Australia's heaviest defeat by runs in ODI history. [19]
1985–86 – Australian fast bowler Bruce Reid took the first hat-trick in the history of the Australian Tri-series in Sydney versus New Zealand on 29 January 1986.
1986–87 – This season was the first time the 4-times Tri-Series champions, West Indies did not make the finals as England beat Australia 2–0. Mike Gatting 's side also won that season's Ashes Test match series and the Perth Challenge one day tournament.
1988–89 – The first match of that season's tournament, West Indies v Pakistan , Adelaide , 10 December 1988, was the first one day international to feature shirts bearing the player's names. [20]
1988–89 – In the third final at Sydney, rain stopped play for one hour and 25 minutes with West Indies at 47/2 after 6.4 overs chasing Australia's 4/226 off 38 overs, and West Indies target was revised to 108 off the 18 overs that remained; West Indies won the match (and the competition) with 4.4 overs remaining after Desmond Haynes hit Steve Waugh for six. Australian fans loudly booed this unsatisfactory conclusion, and criticism from the media led to the average run rate method being replaced by the most productive overs method for setting revised targets in interrupted matfive awards.
2011–12[ edit ]
In the 2011–12 South African summer, de Villiers featured in the home series against Australia and against Sri Lanka . In the latter, he scored a century (160 not out) in South Africa's win in the third and deciding Test of the series. He was named the Player of the Series, having scored 353 runs at an average of 117.66. [13] He then led South Africa for his first series since being appointed captain of the One Day International team. In his first match as captain, South Africa inflicted the heaviest defeat in Sri Lanka's history, with a 258-run win in Paarl on 11 January 2012. [14] It was also the largest margin of victory (by runs) in an ODI match between two Test-playing teams. [15] South Africa went on to win the ODI series, and De Villiers was named player of the series, having scored 329 runs at an average of 109.66, [16] including a century (125 not out) in the fifth and final match in Johannesburg . [17] On 10 July, De Villiers was handed full-time wicketkeeping duties after Mark Boucher announced retirement from cricket after suffering eye injuries from a hit from a bail the day before.
2013[ edit ]
On 4 February 2013, de Villiers equalled Jack Russell's record of 11 dismissals in a match. [18] He also scored an unbeaten 103 off 117 balls in South Africa's second innings of the same match. In the process, he became the first wicketkeeper to score a century and claim 10 dismissals in a Test. [19]

Under the captaincy of de Villiers, South Africa qualified for the semi-finals of the World Cup, but lost to New Zealand in the match. De Villiers finished the tournament as the third highest rungetter with 482 runs behind Martin Guptill and Kumar Sangakkara .
He is ranked number 1 in the ICC batsmen rating in One day International cricket. Also he is ranked number 1 in the ICC batsmen rating in Test cricket. [23]



Early career[ edit ]
Watson was an AIS Australian Cricket Academy scholarship holder in 2000. [20] He started his first-class cricketing career for Tasmania after leaving his home state of Queensland , but returned to play for his native Queensland as his international career was beginning. He has also played for Hampshire in the English County Championship in 2005. He regards Terry Alderman as one of his mentors.
International career[ edit ]
Watson in 2005
Watson was selected for his first Australian team in early 2002, being selected to tour South Africa with the Test team after topping the Pura Cup wicket-taking charts for Tasmania, as well as steady middle-order batting performances. Australian captain at the time Steve Waugh stated that Watson would possibly be Australia's first genuine all rounder since Keith Miller and Alan Davidson in the 1950s. Watson expressed joy at being selected in an Australian team with Waugh, whom he cited as his idol. Watson scored an unbeaten century on his debut in a tour match, but did not play in the Tests as the selectors retained the same XI that had swept South Africa 3–0 in the Australian season. Watson did make his ODI debut on tour, ironically replacing Waugh, who was sacked after the team failed to make the ODI finals in the preceding Australian summer. Watson continued as a regular member of the ODI team until he suffered three stress fractures in his back, at the start of 2003, missing the 2003 Cricket World Cup . He was replaced by his Queensland teammate Andrew Symonds , who proceeded to establish his position as the all rounder after scoring 143* and 91* during the tournament.
Watson's injury sidelined him until the 2003–04 Australian season, and during his rehabilitation he played most of the season as a batsman, allowing himself to improve his batting skills while his back was still healing. During this time he smashed an unbeaten 300* for his club side, Lindisfarne .
Watson returned to regular ODI duty in the 2004–05 season, as a bowling all rounder. He also played in the Third Test against Pakistan as the fifth bowler, in order to allow Australia to play two spinners and three pace bowlers on a dry Sydney Cricket Ground pitch.
Following England 's Ashes victory over Australia in 2005 with a five bowler strategy, Australia responded by including Watson as the fifth bowler and all rounder in all Test matches. Watson stated his intention to emulate Andrew Flintoff , who played the analogous role for England. Watson played against the ICC World XI in the role, but he dislocated his shoulder in just his second Test in that designated role against the West Indies , after diving to field a ball. Watson was again replaced by Symonds and was unable to represent Australia for the remainder of the summer.
He was recalled for the one day squad for the 2006 tour of South Africa but was dropped when all-rounder Andrew Symonds returned from injury. Watson was looking to establish a place in the Test side when he got injured, and Andrew Symonds stepped in to fill the gap.
Watson with Australia in 2009
Watson had been previously criticised for his relatively flat bowling trajectory and inability to move the ball, reflected in his relatively high bowling average. Jamie Cox , a former Tasmanian team-mate and future Australian selector, felt that Watson was being mis-used as a bowling allrounder, believing that he was better suited as a conventional batsman and part-timer bowler, rather than a bowler who engaged in power hitting in the latter part of an innings.
This changed when Watson opened the batting for Australia at the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy , alongside wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist, instead of Simon Katich . In the competition he impressed with both the ball and bat, as Australia moved to their first Champions Trophy victory. Critics and captain Ricky Ponting cited his better strike rate, straight hitting and the ability to bowl as the reasons why he was selected ahead of Katich. After failing in the first two matches against the West Indies and England, Watson made a 50 in Australia's victory over India, which sealed their place in the semi-finals, he then took 2 wickets and scored 57 not out in the finals to seal the win. In the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy held in South Africa, Watson again played a prominent role, making two consecutive 100s against England and New-Zealand in semi-final and final, helping Australia to defend their title.
Ponting suggested that Watson would bat at the number 6 position in the Ashes series against England in 2006–07, and he was named in the squad. However, he came off the ground in a one-day domestic game the week before the first Test with a suspected hamstring tear, which ruled him out for the first three Tests. Michael Clarke was called up in Watson's place, and responded with a half-century, and then a century to cement Clarke's place in the team.
Watson was expected to be fit for the fourth Test on Boxing Day and the MCG in Melbourne, and because of Damien Martyn 's unexpected retirement, it looked likely that Watson would be included in the side. However, another injury setback in a match for Queensland ruled Watson out for the rest of the Ashes series. Watson eventually returned in February to the ODI side, replacing Cameron White in the all rounder position, However he again broke down with injury during the 29th match of 2007 Cricket World Cches. [21]
1992–93 – West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons recorded bowling figures of 4/3 from 10 overs against Pakistan in Sydney . These remain the most economical bowling figures in one-day international history (qualification of 30 balls bowled). [22]
1995–96 – The first match in the tournament, West Indies v Sri Lanka Adelaide , 15 December 1995, was the first One Day International that featured numbers and names on the back of player's shirts after they were introduced for that season's Mercantile Mutual Cup tournament. [23] That same year, Michael Bevan famously hit four runs off the last ball of the match to give Australia victory against West Indies on New Year's Day . [24]
1996–97 – Australia misses the finals for the first time since the 1979–80 Series; it is also the first time West Indies finish as Runners-up, with Pakistan winning the series 2 – 0, and not even a blackout in the 2nd final could stop them from winning.
2000–01 – Mark Waugh scored 173 runs for Australia against West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , the highest innings total in Australian Tri-Series history. [25]
2001–02 – Australia misses the finals for a third time, South Africa wins the finals 2 – 0 over New Zealand.
2003–04 – Ajit Agarkar recorded bowling figures of 6/42 from 9.3 overs against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It was the first and, to date, only six wicket haul in an Australian Tri-series match. [26]
2005–06 – In the third final at Brisbane , Adam Gilchrist scored the fastest century in Australian Tri-Series history off 67 balls versus Sri Lanka . [27]
2006–07 – Despite losing 5–0 to the Australians in the Ashes , England staged a comeback to win the tri-series against them. [28]
2011–12 – Daniel Christian became the 31st person , and only the 4th Australian, to take a One Day hat-trick . [29] [30]

Dhoni thought clearly and led from the front; Ponting was powerless and unsure of both himself and his players

Dhoni marshalled his players expertly and batted superbly

Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Ricky Ponting might as well come from the same street, the same school, the same suburb. They emerged from the backwaters and arrived on the cricket scene with sharp minds and hardened games. As time passed, both learnt to use the right words and sometimes to think the right things, and in Mohali both led their teams onto the field. Already both had far surpassed the expectations of youth. Hereafter their fortunes took different courses.
By the end of an extraordinary Test match in the Punjab, Dhoni was praising his players for securing an overwhelming victory, and was also accepting the award as Man of the Match. His counterpart was left nursing bruised egos and lost souls. It was not so long ago that the Tasmanian had been comparing the new-age cricket played by his side against the tired old efforts of his opponents. Seldom has complacency so comprehensively been shattered. As a rule a man gets his desserts, and the same applies to cricket teams. Nor is it wise to tempt fate.
Besides winning the toss Dhoni made two telling moves in the match. Neither affected the course of the contest but both told a tale about India's new leader, a man whose clarity of thought had already impressed senior players. His first intervention came when India were pursuing quick runs in the second innings. Ordinarily a new captain might be expected to treat India's phalanx of famous batsmen with kid gloves. After all, an entire nation was in thrall to them. But Dhoni knows no such deference. To him they are just a bunch of cricketers he has been asked to lead. He respects them, likes them, admires them, but does not live in fear of them. He has driven fiery motorbikes in his time and that prepares a man for all eventualities. So he strapped the pads on himself.
As ever, his reasoning was straightforward. His team needed to push the score along and he was the right man for the job. This ability to make objective judgments, especially about oneself, is rare at any stage of a career, let alone at its outset. Nor did he allow notions of wounded pride to hold him back. Instead he told astute Dravid, mighty Tendulkar and dazzling Laxman to wait a while. Instead he instructed Sourav Ganguly to follow him to the crease. After all they had batted fluently in the first dig. Ganguly had contributed a smooth and composed hundred, while the acting captain had broken his duck with another statement of intent, a hook off his eyebrows that sped away to the boundary.
At once Dhoni's action conveyed a message to his players: the team came first, and the captain was going to lead from the front. And it worked. Bold decisions are almost always rewarded. Probably because they instill confidence in the team, give it priorities and a sense of direction.
Dhoni's other significant action in his second outing as Test captain came at the fall of the last Australian wicket. He did not punch the air with glee or charge towards his players or otherwise display any of the ecstasy detected in the Australians at the end of the travesty in Sydney . Rather, he picked up one of the stumps, walked quietly across to Gautam Gambhir, whose batting had been so important, and gave it to him. Gambhir was not surprised. Apparently stumps were also given to Amit Mishra, Virender Sehwag and Sourav Ganguly. It was a considerate gesture from a captain towards one of his young players. Doubtless it was appreciated. Here was a man in charge of himself and his team, a man capable of giving and inspiring loyalty.
 
 
Ordinarily a new captain might be expected to treat India's phalanx of famous batsmen with kid gloves. Dhoni knows no such deference. To him they are just a bunch of cricketers he has been asked to lead. He respects them, likes them, admires them, but does not live in fear of them  
Dhoni had every right to be pleased with himself but he did not show it. Nor did he say anything about captaining the team in the next match. He does not get carried away. Afterwards India was ablaze with debate about the rights and wrongs of playing Anil Kumble or Amit Mishra in Delhi. At such times the choice between newcomer and proven performer, worn-wicket specialist and hard-track tweaker, fit and sore, is especially painful because it is final. But Australia yearns to face such a predicament. At least India has found Kumble's replacement: in a roly poly character who went to Haryana to advance his career and was able to learn his trade away from the spotlight without the pressures and distractions that attend city slickers and youthful prodigies.
India could also be delighted with the performances of its new-ball pairs. It has been a long time since Australia was given such a trouncing, even longer since its opening batsmen and bowlers were so decisively outplayed. Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan were far more effective than their counterparts. Gambhir and Sehwag, his pal from Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Delhi, Delhi Daredevils and India, ran superbly between wickets as they built two damaging partnerships. Only one of the four played in the Boxing Day Test ten months ago. India has come a long way in a short time.
They even had the cheek to steal a page from Australia's book, naming the side for the next two matches towards the end of the fourth day and crowding the bat with Zaheerb on a hat-trick. Hereabouts a voice in the press box gasped, " I thought Australia was supposed to be the aggressive side."
By the end of the match the Indian camp seemed confident and content. No longer was anyone fretting about the supposed Fab Four. They had taken care of that. No longer did the Australians seem as formidable. Previously it has taken astonishing contributions from exceptional players to bring them down. Always it had been an upset that provoked shock and celebration. Now India had done a professional job and it was enough. Australia had been massacred. Only two s first-class debut for Queensland at the Gabba , Johnson takes three wickets against New Zealand. However, the lasting mark is of him entering at No. 11 and hitting his fifth ball for six.

Downs and ups
Plays his maiden one-day and Shield matches for Queensland but his back is a problem again and he succumbs to a fourth stress fracture. He loses his state contract, drives a plumbing van, and briefly considers giving up the game. The recovery begins when he gets through the 2004-05 season with the Bulls and is called up for Australia A's tour of Pakistan.

Green and gold
A surprise selection for the one-day series in New Zealand, he debuts in Christchurch and goes for 64 in nine overs. At the time his best first-class figures in 12 first-class games were 5 for 43, and he had to wait a year for his next ODI.
March 24-28, 2006
Domestic bliss
Named Man of the Match for taking ten wickets in the domestic final , including 6 for 51 in the second innings, to give Queensland the title. The performance helps earn a spot on Australia's tour of Bangladesh and he plays three one-day games.
September-October 2006
Firing up
A tournament in Malaysia is the venue for Johnson to show his potential and he carries on the form in the Champions Trophy. By the end of the one-day tours he has picked up the memorable wickets of Tendulkar, Dravid, Lara and Pietersen. Throughout the home summer he is 12th man for all five Ashes Tests and goes to the World Cup but doesn't play a game.

Finally, a baggy green
After a bumpy ride his debut comes at home against Sri Lanka at the Gabba . His arrival has been trumpeted so loudly that when he makes it - at the fresh age of 26 - he is slightly underwhelming. He looks nervous, unsure and struggles with his action, but still returns eight wickets in his opening two games.

WACA warrior
A career-best 8 for 61 in Perth , including 5 for 2 in 21 balls of fear, stamps him as the emerging attack leader. The stunning display occurs on his new home ground following his move from Brisbane to Perth to be with his fiancée Jessica Bratich. Unfortunately for Johnson, his 11 wickets for the game can't stop South Africa from chasing down 414.
March 6-10, 2009
The green mamba
South Africa were the best batting side in the world when Johnson ripped into them in Durban . Three for 37 doesn't look much on the scorecard, but it was the innings he completed the journey from a kid with massive potential to being the real deal. While his removal of Hashim Amla and Neil McKenzie in his opening over was impressive, he highlighted his potency by fracturing a bone in Graeme Smith's hand for the second time in two months and split Jacques Kallis' chin. Jason Gillespie was impressed. "You break someone's hand, you send someone off to get stitches in their chin and you pick up a couple of important wickets - that's as intimidating as you can get."

Three figures in Cape Town
His bowling had been world class and his batting was pretty good too. After two half-centuries, including an unbeaten 96, earlier in the series, he finished it with his first Test hundred in Cape Town . In home and away series he had been an all-round star, finishing with 33 wickets in six Tests.

Troubled by a public family argument and struggling with his technique, Johnson delivers his worst performance in a Test at Lord's. He has always had inconsistent moments, but he is unsure where the ball is heading as he returns 3 for 132 at more than a run a ball in the first innings. It is not until two Tests later in Leeds that he feels comfortable again, taking five wickets to seal the win .

Mark Twain said three weeks were required to prepare a good impromptu speech, but for Shane Watson it took eight years of first-class studying to become a Test batsman in a day. Watson, 27, achieved the upgraded reputation on Sunday with a classy innings in the most examining conditions.
It was not because the 78 almost doubled his previous best in Tests, but because of the poise and sense he showed in a crisis. Australia were in a disastrous position and with each hard-earned run, forward push or back-foot pull, he dragged them closer to India's distant total. Australia have Watson to thank for giving them a chance to save the game over the next two days.
Seeing Watson relaxed yet committed for so long was strange. For most of his international career he has been the one-day man trying to blast late or early runs in a muscular style. In first-class matches in Australia and England he has scored 12 centuries, including two doubles. He knows how to bat. This was his chance to prove it in Tests.
Watson walked out to start the day with Australia 102 for 4 and shortly before lunch the situation was a dire 167 for 7. Mostly because of his fragile body, Watson has also had to put up with regular murmurs of mental weakness. This innings showed he is a cricketer with fight.
"I'm learning a lot, I learnt a lot from the last innings in Bangalore and was able to take that into this innings today," he said. "It's not as tough as it's going to get, but it's one of the tougher innings I'll play."
When the ball wasn't swinging, it was spinning from the hands of Harbhajan Singh and Amit Mishra. With every over, Watson was scrutinised and for more than four hours and 155 deliveries he succeeded. Only when he went back to Mishra and the ball stayed low could India remove him. A century was out of reach - there were only two tailenders for company - but he deserved to remain unbeaten.
Showing surprisingly soft hands for a player brought up in pace-friendly Queensland, Watson countered the spinners in comfort. Once settled, he was happy to go down the pitch, but he was quick to step a long way back when given the opportunity, like Damien Martyn four years ago. Sometimes he was so sharp it was like watching the footwork of Michael Clarke.
To Harbhajan - and, at times, to some of the fast men - he took guard on off stump for extra protection. "I find it gets me in line with the ball a lot more, especially with the ball turning into me," he said. "It's just something I've been working on the last couple of years."
In his stance Watson is so regimented, like an amateur golfer trying to remember four coaching tips at once. Then the downswing starts and everything becomes natural. He was pleased his technique held up so well under such heavy testing.
"My batting has evolved a lot over the past three or four years," he said. "I've had a couple of really good batting coaches, working on a few things to the quicks and spin. It's great when the things you've been working on come off and I can bat for long periods of time. It was such an enjoyable, challenging day."
Over the past couple of off-seasons Watson has spent thousands of hours in the nets working on a method that will gain him this success. Andrew Symonds' ill-discipline gave Watson the chance to show he could be a fully-fledged international batsman. In his fifth Test, he took it.

A mother and her seven-year-old son died when a landslide caused by the heavy rains crushed their house. [24] In another incident two people were injured when a tree fell on their house. [25] Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit estimated that 100 to 125 homes were damaged, and that the agricultural sector was extensively damaged, in particular the banana crop. [26] In August 2015, Tropical Storm Erika caused extensive flooding and landslides across the island. Multiple communities were evacuated and upwards of 30 people were killed. [27] According to a Rapid Damage and Impact Assessment prepared for Dominica by the World Bank, the total damage and losses from the storm were US $484.82 million or 90% of Dominica's yearly GDP.

Origins[ edit ]
Tribes of Wales at the time of the Roman invasion. The modern English-Welsh border is also shown.
Archaeological evidence from sites in and around Cardiff—the St Lythans burial chamber , near Wenvoe (about four miles (6.4 km) west, south west of Cardiff city centre), the Tinkinswood burial chamber , near St Nicholas (about six miles (10 km) west of Cardiff city centre), the Cae'rarfau Chambered Tomb , Creigiau (about six miles (10 km) north west of Cardiff city centre) and the Gwern y Cleppa Long Barrow, near Coedkernew , Newport (about eight and a quarter miles (13.5 km) north east of Cardiff city centre)—shows that people had settled in the area by at least around 6,000 years before present (BP) , during the early Neolithic; about 1,500 years before either Stonehenge or the Great Pyramid of Giza was completed. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] A group of five Bronze Age tumuli is at the summit of The Garth ( Welsh : Mynydd y Garth), within the county's northern boundary. [17] Four Iron Age hill fort and enclosure sites have been identified within Cardiff's present-day county boundaries, including Caerau Hillfort , an enclosed area of 5.1 hectares (51,000 m2). [18] [19] [20] [21]
Until the Roman conquest of Britain , Cardiff was part of the territory of the Silures – a Celtic British tribe that flourished in the Iron Age – whose territory included the areas that would become known as Breconshire , Monmouthshire and Glamorgan. [22] The 3.2-hectare (8-acre) fort established by the Romans near the mouth of the River Taff in 75 AD, in what would become the north western boundary of the centre of Cardiff, was built over an extensive settlement that had been established by the Silures in the 50s AD. [23] The fort was one of a series of military outposts associated with Isca Augusta ( Caerleon ) that acted as border defences. The fort may have been abandoned in the early 2nd century as the area had been subdued. However, by this time a civilian settlement, or vicus , was established. It was likely made up of traders who made a living from the fort, ex-soldiers and their families. A Roman villa has been discovered at Ely . [24] Contemporary with the Saxon Shore Forts of the 3rd and 4th centuries, a stone fortress was established at Cardiff. Similar to the shore forts, the fortress was built to protect Britannia from raiders. [25] Coins from the reign of Gratian indicate that Cardiff was inhabited until at least the 4th century; the fort was abandoned towards the end of the 4th century, as the last Roman legions left the province of Britannia with Magnus Maximus . [26] [27]
Little is known about the fort and civilian settlement in the period between the Roman departure from Britain and the Norman Conquest. The settlement probably shrank in size and may even have been abandoned. In the absence of Roman rule, Wales was divided into small kingdoms; early on, Meurig ap Tewdrig emerged as the local king in Glywysing (which later became Glamorgan). The area passed through his family until the advent of the Normans in the 11th century. [28]
Norman occupation to the Middle Ages[ edit ]
View of Caerdiffe Castle
In 1081 William I, King of England , began work on the castle keep within the walls of the old Roman fort. [29] Cardiff Castle has been at the heart of the city ever since. [30] The castle was substantially altered and extended during the Victorian period by John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute , and the architect William Burges . Original Roman work can, however, still be distinguished in the wall facings.
A small town grew up in the shadow of the castle, made up primarily of settlers from England. [31] Cardiff had a population of between 1,500 and 2,000 in the Middle Ages, a relatively normal size for a Welsh town in this period. [32] By the end of the 13th century, Cardiff was the only town in Wales with a population exceeding 2,000, but it was relatively small compared with most notable towns in the Kingdom of England . [33]
In the early 12th century a wooden palisade was erected around the city to protect it. Cardiff was a busy port in the Middle Ages, and was declared a Staple port in 1327. [34]
Henry II travelled through Cardiff on his journey to Ireland and had a premonition against the holding of Sunday markets at St Piran's Chapel , which stood in the middle of the road between the castle entrance and Westgate.[ citation needed ]
In 1404 Owain Glyndŵr burned Cardiff and took Cardiff Castle. [34] As the town was still very small, most of the buildings were made of wood and the town was destroyed. However, the town was soon rebuilt and began to flourish once again. [32]
County town of Glamorganshire[ edit ]

In 1536, the Act of Union between England and Wales led to the creation of the shire of Glamorgan, and Cardiff was made the county town . It also became part of Kibbor hundred .[ citation needed ] Around this same time the Herbert family became the most powerful family in the area. [31] In 1538, Henry VIII closed the Dominican and Franciscan friaries in Cardiff, the remains of which were used as building materials. [32] A writer around this period described Cardiff: "The River Taff runs under the walls of his honours castle and from the north part of the town to the south part where there is a fair quay and a safe harbour for shipping." [32]
Cardiff had become a Free Borough in 1542. [34] In 1573, it was made a head port for collection of customs duties, and in 1581, Elizabeth I granted Cardiff its first royal charter . [31] Pembrokeshire historian George Owen described Cardiff in 1602 as "the fayrest towne in Wales yett not the welthiest.", [31] and the town gained a second Royal Charter in 1608. [35]
A disastrous flood of the Bristol Channel on 30 January 1607 (now believed to be a tsunami ) [36] led to a change in the course of the River Taff and the ruining of St Mary's Parish Church , which was replaced by its chapel of ease, St John the Baptist.[ citation needed ]
During the Second English Civil War , St Fagans just to the west of the town, played host to the Battle of St Fagans . The battle, between a Royalist rebellion and a New Model Army detachment, was a decisive victory for the Parliamentarians and allowed Oliver Cromwell to conquer Wales. [34] It is the last major battle to occur in Wales, with about 200 (mostly Royalist) soldiers killed. [31]
In the ensuing century Cardiff was at peace. In 1766, John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute married into the Herbert family and was later created Baron Cardiff , [31] and in 1778 he began renovations on Cardiff Castle. [37] In the 1790s a racecourse , printing press , bank and coffee house all opened, and Cardiff gained a stagecoach service to London. Despite these improvements, Cardiff's position in the Welsh urban hierarchy had declined over the 18th century. Iolo Morgannwg called it "an obscure and inconsiderable place", and the 1801 census found the population to be only 1,870, making Cardiff only the 25th largest town in Wales, well behind Merthyr and Swansea . [38]
Building of the dof the visitors could command a place in the home side, both of them middle-order batsmen.
Ricky Ponting finished the match in an entirely different state of mind. His bowlers had been flogged and there was no respite in sight. His team's fielding had been patchy, with throws missing stumps and overthrows given away, both long regarded as tell-tale signs of a team falling apart. His bowlers had been unable to control, let alone disconcert, their opponents. Worse, the batting had lacked any sense of rhythm. In the first innings the batsmen had been cautious as they dutifully tried to build a wall around their wickets the better to resist the Indian onslaught. Anxious to make amends in their second outing, they had lurched too far in the opposite direction, slashing away in a manner bringing to mind Macbeth at Banquo's ghost. It had been a lamentable, lacklustre display. Despite Michael Clarke's game innings, it was a defeat wrapped in darkness
To add insult to injury, Ponting had himself failed twice, and on both occasions had been uprooted by his nemesis, Ishant Sharma, whose pace and inswing has exposed a chink in technique. No wonder that at the end of the match Ponting looked as miserable as he did. His team was in trouble and his own game was not working. Already it was bad enough, but even that was not the end of it.

Ponting's argument with Brett Lee touched a nerve. It is not uncommon for fast bowlers and captains to fall out from time to time. Indeed it is not unknown for captains deliberately to instigate a row on the grounds that the paceman probably will not thump his leader, not in public anyhow, and might instead take it out on the batsmen. Such tempests are usually temporary, and easily settled with a well-timed peace offering that often bears a stark resemblance to a glass of beer.
But this stoush was different because it was between two friends and hurting players. Lee has been having a rough time on and off the field. To his frustration he has not been able to swing the ball or bowl fast or accurately enough to pin the batsmen down. Accordingly he was sensitive to any slight and was dismayed that he was at the back of the bowling queue on the fourth morning - a sentiment he expressed to his nearby leader.
Far from taking the protest in his stride, Ponting overreacted, a response that showed he was rattled. Never before can he have felt so powerless on a cricket field. He might as well have been trying to solve a quadratic equation. Captaining strong teams is relatively easy. Leaders of losing outfits require degrees in psychology, medicine, law, labour relations, mathematics and much else. Yet it was not Lee that was the problem. It was the other experienced campaigners he relied on in tough times, Matthew Hayden and Andrew Symonds. One of them had gone AWOL and the other was not scoring any runs. Ponting was not on top of himself or his senior players.
Despite their similarities, the contrast with his counterpart could not have been greater. As so often, the story of the cricket match was the tale of two captains.

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 4th day October 20, 2008
Outbatted, outbowled, outmatched
The Australians were unable to curb the Indian batsmen's aggressive approach

It was intimidating to watch. First the openers came out to bat and the heady rhythm of strokes belted out was reminiscent of a manic Keith Moon behind his drum kit. There were 130 runs at five an over in the first session and the rate was maintained later, with 214 runs eventually plundered from 42 overs. It made no difference if it was pace or spin. The leading fast bowler was taken for 72 from his 14 overs, and the spinners were carted for 54 from nine. It would have been exhilarating to watch in a one-day game. As part of a five-day spectacle, it was almost unprecedented.
Who else could we talking about but Australia? For more than a decade, while other sides talked of "brave cricket" and then lost their nerve, Australia flattened opponents home and away as a matter of routine. Batsmen came out and walloped 18 runs in the opening over of a series, bowlers thudded deliveries into stumps, helmets and knuckles, and even geriatric stalwarts with avian nicknames threw themselves full-length in the Adelaide outfield to take catches that beggared belief.
On Monday morning though, the other side came out swinging and Australia were left bereft of answers. Back in 2001, the juggernaut that had crushed everything in its path for 16 games came to a shuddering halt when India refused to be cowed at Eden Gardens despite the hopeless situation that they found themselves in at the end of day three. By the time the teams reached Chennai for the deciding Test, the aura had gone, and India calmly picked off 510 in response to Australia's 391 to set up a series win.
Since the Ashes were surrendered to an English side that dared to set the tone on an astonishing opening day at Edgbaston, Australia have seldom been challenged. The one time they looked most ill at ease was in Perth last January, when an Indian team seething after the perceived injustices of Sydney pulled off a stunning win at the WACA. Again, someone had wrenched the conducting baton out of Australian hands, and the big boys couldn't play.
His critics can say all that they want to about Mahendra Singh Dhoni being a lucky captain. The toss certainly played a part here, but as his powerful batting displays - such a contrast from the imposter who scratched around at the Chinnaswamy Stadium - have shown, he seems to thrive on the added responsibility. In the first innings, his 92 was the difference between a modest total and an imposing one, and on the fourth morning he decided to trust his shot-making ability after Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir had pillaged 182.
Ricky Ponting got the kind of ball from Ishant Sharma that makes batsmen wake up in a cold sweat

With the famed middle order looking on, it was a move that would have attracted considerable ridicule if it backfired. Instead, Dhoni thumped 68 from 84 balls, including a six off Cameron White that came to a rest 25 yards inside the field after cannoning into the sightscreen. He made sure India didn't overdo it either. With runs coming so easily, the batsmen must have been queuing up, but the declaration came well before tea, leaving India with 136 overs to ensure that their dominance of the game was translated into the right result.
Australia's chase was in ruins within 10.2 overs. There had been signs in the morning that they were losing the plot. There was an animated argument between Ricky Ponting and Brett Lee before lunch, presumably something to do with the fact that the leader of the pace pack wasn't required to bowl until after everyone has finished their roti and butter chicken. And that simmering rage seemed to afflict the batting as well.
Matthew Hayden has never been known for the backward step, but even by his standards, the belligerence shown during a 20-ball 29 was extraordinary. It was as if he wanted to hit every delivery into the cement moat that rings the venue. And it was a reflection of the kind of series that he's having that he fell to the sweep, the stroke that fetched him hundreds of runs back in 2001.
Simon Katich fell to a frankly appalling stroke, while Ricky Ponting got the kind of ball that makes batsmen wake up in a cold sweat. That, and the delivery which darted back to trap Shane Watson in front, crowned a magnificent spell from Ishant Sharma, who must surely now be considered one of the best fast bowlers in the world. India's pace bowlers now have 18 wickets in the series, while it needed a miscue from Sourav Ganguly to gift Lee his fourth of the series. The times, they certainly are a changin'.

Comfort-2nd Test, Mohali October 16, 2008
India have tough questions to tackle

Are India looking more at the past - in Kumble's great record, in the old two-spinner theory - than looking to play the four best bowlers available?

Will Anil Kumble be fit, and will India play two spinners?

The biggest question India grappled with a day before the start of the second Test was the fitness of Anil Kumble, their captain and an integral part of a two-spin, two-pace attack. The answer, about 21 hours before the captains walked out for the toss, was the same as it was in Kanpur earlier this year. He was troubled by a bad shoulder then, as he is now. "If I can bowl, I will play...So I will assess how I feel in the morning," Kumble had said a day before the Kanpur Test . "It's 24 hours before the match, so we'll just wait and see how it responds," he said on Thursday. He didn't play in Kanpur, and we'll know only at the toss tomorrow if he does here.
"It's a lot better than what it was yesterday," he said. Yesterday he hadn't even bowled at the nets. Today he said he did, in the privacy of the indoor nets.
India go into an important Test match with more questions than answers, in contrast to their opponets. Stuart Clark, one of Australia's main bowlers, was injured during the Bangalore Test. He didn't bowl yesterday, took a fitness test today, during which he bowled around 30 deliveries, and didn't look fit enough to play a Test. As a result the man who will take his place, Peter Siddle, knows a day in advance, and has time to settle his nerves before his Test debut.
The replacement for Kumble, if needed, both as player and captain, will get to know about an hour before the match. It's an academic thought but India don't have a designated vice-captain either. Going by the Kanpur precedent, Mahendra Singh Dhoni should lead the side if Kumble is not fit to play. Australia have always gone after the opposition captain; here, the captain has left himself open to being a target.
The weather, and its effects on the pitch, could also have a bearing on the combination. The rains have meant the pitch has stayed under the covers for too long, and hasn't had the desired amount of sunlight. As a result, it is expected to retain some of the moisture underneath the top surface, which looks pretty dry. The curator expects the pitch to be sluggish until, as he hopes, the sun beats down on it consistently.
Again, there are two ways of looking at the sluggish pitch. The spinners might not get the kind of bounce they enjoy in Mohali - as Kumble has done here, with two Man-of-the-Match performances. The pace bowlers might not get the kind of carry. In such a scenario, Munaf Patel sounds a better option than Amit Mishra, going by recent form and experience. This is also the venue where Munaf made his promising debut two years ago. He has gone through a lot since then, and is back with the same promise, perhaps more.
Kumble's fitness and the ideal combination in his absence has left a lot of doubt. But there is a larger question India need to come face to face with, sooner or later and regardless of Kumble's fitness. Are they ready to - and it's not as bold a move as it sounds - play three fast bowlers in home Tests? Especially when there are three pace bowlers close to pretty much the best they have been?
 
 
Are India looking more at the past - in Kumble's great record, in the old two-spinner theory - than looking to play the four best bowlers available?
 
And if they choose to go with five bowlers, it will involve another emotionally detached decision, the kind India are not known for. Playing five batsmen would mean dropping either Sourav Ganguly or VVS Laxman. One of them is in his last series, the other is three Tests short of 100. Even though the batsmen did enough in Bangalore to save the Test and their places in the side, the bowling attack didn't look potent enough to force the issue. This pitch here is expected to be better for batting.
The last time India went with three fast bowlers, when not playing five bowlers, in a home Test, was against Pakistan in 2004-05 - incidentally, at the same venue. L Balaji, Irfan Pathan and Zaheer Khan had done well then to bowl Pakistan out on the first day but in the second innings, when the pitch became easier to bat on, India couldn't bowl Pakistan out. Pakistan started the fifth day 53 runs ahead with four wickets in hand. Kumble managed two wickets on the fifth day, but the match was saved by Abdul Razzaq and Kamran Akmal.
The pitches in India have, however, changed since. It's hard to find a track - Kanpur was an underprepared exception - that of late has been a typical Indian minefield. Are India looking more at the past - at Kumble's great record, at the old two-spinner theory - than looking to play the four best bowlers available?

T20
Profile
Ricky Ponting, the most uncompromising player of his generation, grew into Australia's most successful run-maker and only sits below Bradman in the country's overall ratings. It takes an extremely critical eye to diminish his run-scoring achievements, which seem to collect new records in every series. Like spotting a celebrity, it's necessary to look twice when analysing Ponting, first as the archetypal modern batsman, then as the country's 42nd Test captain. There is no doubt about his greatness after taking guard, but his leadership has been under scrutiny for much of his reign. While his blade has sparkled, his stewardship is pock-marked by three  Ashes defeats - two in England and one at home - and stumbles to South Africa and India.
Those results didn't stop him from becoming the most successful captain in Test history after passing Steve Waugh's 41 wins in the 2009-10 Boxing Day Test. In the same match he overtook Shane Warne's 92 victories as the most by an individual, and he led Australia to 26 consecutive undefeated (completed) World Cup games. He stepped down from the captaincy when that run ended, in the 2011 World Cup. For the first three years of his reign he was in charge of a superstar unit and did not have to decide much tactically, but once that group headed for retirement he had to change from a manager to moulder.
As a batsman the only debate is where to rank him in the high reaches of the game's greatest run-makers. Acclaimed by Academy coach Rod Marsh as the best teenage batsman he had ever seen, Ponting began with Tasmania at 17 and Australia at 20, and was given out unluckily for 96 on his Test debut. There were some teething problems, including a public admission of an alcohol problem, but the longer he went on the more he matured, building up records and runs.
He plays all the shots with a full flourish of the bat - the cover drive and the pull are particularly productive methods - and knows only to attack. His breathtaking, dead-eye fielding is a force in the game by itself. Only Sachin Tendulkar has more centuries in Tests and ODIs combined than Ponting, who is a natural in the game's traditional forms, but resistant to the perks of Twenty20, from which he retired from in 2009. There have been setbacks against probing seam attacks, high-class finger-spin and, latterly, short balls, which he insists are meant to be pulled or hooked.
After a fairly prolonged patchy run of form, Ponting announced that the Perth Test against South Africa in November-December 2012 would be his last international match.

break blues
The ICC has come down hard on what they call the "comfort breaks", which means the random breaks players take when they get tired, and get a fresh substitute on for that while. Rudi Koertzen was alert to it when Simon Katich wanted to go for one such break during the first session today. As a result Katich decided against taking that breather because that would have meant only 10 men on the field. Something similar happened during the Bangalore Test when Michael Clarke bowled one over with 10 men on the field: Ponting had gone for a break then.
Hometown blues
Brett Lee has taken quite well to Mohali. He has learnt a bit of the language - he is quite impressive at that - and he also calls the PCA Stadium his other home ground, considering he plays for Kings XI Punjab in the IPL. But he had a rather forgettable day on the field today. He looked innocuous to Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, was lucky in getting Rahul Dravid's wicket, his only success of the day, ending with 1 for 56 off 18 overs.
Delaying-tactics blues
It's time for Sachin Tendulkar to join the Australian media in complaining about Sourav Ganguly's delaying tactics. He doesn't quite discriminate. While the whole nation waited, and a sparse crowd at the stadium as well, Tendulkar was five runs short, with about eight minutes to go to for the tea break. He took a single off the first ball, and watched Ganguly get the sightscreen adjusted, and then pull out of the second delivery of the over. That ended the possibility of getting in an extra over before tea, and Ganguly blocked the rest of the over out. In the next over, Tendulkar managed another single, and went off to spend 20 more minutes as the second-highest run-getter in the world.
The PCA contributed to the delay, too, but only after Tendulkar got to the record. It set off fireworks in celebration, during the day, would you believe it? There was nothing but smoke and noise for three minutes. Play, obviously, was held up all that while.
Golden-arm blues
Michael Clarke has long been a bowling thorn in the fleshy Indian batting's thorn. So when Australia had a barren first session, they wanted to see if he could work some magic in the last over before lunch. Gautam Gambhir, on 42 when the over started, had other ideas. He stepped out twice and lofted Clarke for two boundaries in the over and reached his half-century before the break. So much for the golden arm.
Sorry it took so long, mate

First-ball blues
When you are a pace bowler, you don't want the first ball you bowl in Test cricket to stay low. But for Peter Siddle, it sort of clicked. He dug in his first delivery short and Gambhir ducked into it a second too soon just to have the ball stay low and hit him flush in the helmet. It was an unsettling blow, in the second over of the innings, but Gambhir came back well from it.
Down-the-legs blues
How frustrating is it to edge an innocuous ball, going down the leg side, minding its own business? How frustrating is it for a team to do it twice in one day, to the same bowler? India did that today when Sehwag, and VVS Laxman gifted Mitchell Johnson their wickets after looking good in the middle.
Third-umpire blues
Late in the day, Cameron White beat Ganguly with a topspinner, and seemed to have dragged him out as well. Brad Haddin whipped the bails, but Koertzen thought Ganguly was back in time, and didn't go the third umpire. Replays showed Ganguly's back foot was still in the air when the bails were removed, and memories of a certain Andrew Symonds and Steve Bucknor came to mind. Ganguly was 35, then; what fun it will be if he goes on to score 150?
Under-rated milestone blues
When Ganguly square-drove Johnson for a couple at around 3.46pm, he crossed the 7000-run mark. He didn't raise his bat after that, neither did he take his helmet off. Ricky Ponting didn't rush madly towards him to shake his hand, and neither did the PCA set off invisible fireworks. What a shame.

India v Australia, 2nd test, Mohali, 5th day October 21, 2008
India's winning habit
The second Test at Mohali was a rare happening as the Australians were toyed around and thoroughly dominated by India

Trucks in the Punjab are famous for the one-line messages they carry. One of the typically earthy ones is, "Vekhi ja, par chedi na [Keep watching my truck, but don't fiddle around]." For four days and a bit in Mohali, India were the runaway truck that Australia could only watch and do nothing about.
It is a rare happening: When was the last time a team toyed around with Australia? When was the last time Australia were so dominated? One has to go back more than 10 years, to the same opposition and country, to Eden Gardens 1997-98. So long ago that only five players, on both sides, from that Test played in this match. Between Eden Gardens and Mohali, Australia played 117 matches, losing 15, without being so completely outplayed even once.
What would be more satisfactory for India, though, is that this win didn't come on a crumbling dustbowl; home advantage counted for nought this time. It was a good batting track, looking like any Australian pitch, with a little less bounce, on the first day. Contrast this with Eden Gardens 1998, when India played with three spinners, and Sourav Ganguly opened the bowling. Over the last five days, though, and on the same pitch, the ball would lose all potency the moment it was handled by Australian bowlers.
To be fair to the Australians, this isn't the same team that dominated the world over the last decade. Some of the best players in that side - Shane Warne, Adam Gilchrist, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer - have gone. Also, they embarked on this tour - possibly their toughest assignment of recent times - without Andrew Symonds; discipline problem or not, it's a mistake they may yet come to regret. Even so, it would take a special effort to put the boot in, simply because of their winning habit and the belief that they can pull themselves out of any kind of strife.
 
 
"Especially at one time in the first innings, they [Australia] were 22 from 13 overs. I said to Rahul [Dravid], 'Look at the board, we won't see that again'"Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 
It's perhaps fitting that this defeat has been inflicted by India, who have stood up to Australia, competed against them more consistently than any other team in the past decade. And India are the only team who constantly threaten to outskill them: once it was their mysterious spin bowling and imperious batting, here the biggest difference between the teams was the quality of the pace bowling.
While Australia struggled for any disconcerting movement, the Indian bowlers got prodigious swing, both conventional and reverse. A TV split-screen visual of the six-over-old ball being used by both the teams told a story. While the one Australia used was scuffed up all over, the one India used had two markedly different sides, shiny and rough. That meant the ball started reversing as early as in the ninth over at times, a sensational phenomenon. And since it's still hard and new that early, as MS Dhoni suggested, it was all the more difficult to face. "The ball [from Ishant Sharma] that got me would get me 95 times out of 100," Ricky Ponting confessed.
The batsmen and the spinners did their job too. Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag gave India two fiery starts, putting Australia on the back foot right away. The middle order revived them after a brief blip. Amit Mishra's debut was phenomenal, a throwback to the old days of classical legspin bowling. And Harbhajan Singh fast-tracked Australia to their demise in the second innings.
Right from the toss, India did little wrong. The one potentially distracting period was when Tendulkar moved towards his record but India regrouped well. They were aggressive throughout, and there wasn't a single player in the side they needed to hide. You could say they had nine potential Man-of-the-Match wiup and missed two matches of the Super 8's before returning in fine style smashing an unbeaten 65 off 32 balls against New Zealand. Injury again struck Watson in the early stages of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 as he missed most of the tournament due to hamstring strain. He was then out of action for the 2007–08 Australian season.
After Symonds was omitted from the Australian team for disciplinary reasons, and Watson took the all rounder's position for the tour of India in late-2008, batting at No. 6. During the Third Test in Delhi, he was involved in a series of confrontations with Indian opener Gautam Gambhir , who scored a double century and reached his century by lofting Watson over midwicket for six. During the innings, Gambhir elbowed Watson while going for a run, and claimed that the incident was not intentional at a press conference, and claiming that Watson had no capacity to dismiss him. He later pleaded guilty and was banned for one match.
After returning to Australia, Symonds was recalled to the Test team and both all rounders played in the First Test against New Zealand in Brisbane. As the pitch was a green, rain-affected moist surface expected to favour seamers, spinner Jason Krejza was dropped to accommodate two seam bowling all rounders. After the match, which Australia won, Watson was dropped as spinner Nathan Hauritz was included and Symonds retained. Symonds continued to perform poorly, and there were calls for Watson to take his place, but both men then fell injured at the end of the year, Watson with a stress fracture. Watson returned to international duty in the ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE, scoring a century.
Shane Watson in 2012
He returned to the Australian Test side for the 3rd Ashes Test match at Edgbaston on 30 July 2009 when he replaced opener Phillip Hughes who had been struggling for form. In a rain interrupted match he made 62 and 53 batting alongside Simon Katich . [21] He scored his second highest Test score of 96 against the West Indies in the Second Test in Adelaide in December 2009. He and Katich put on a century stand and he had reached 96 at stumps, only to inside edge his first ball of the next morning onto his stumps while attempting to hit a boundary to reach his century. In the Third Test, he made 89 in another century stand with Katich. In the second innings, he removed opposition captain Chris Gayle and then charged towards him, screaming in celebration directly in front of him. This earned him a fine from the match referee, and considerable criticism from much of the Australian public.
In the First Test against Pakistan, he made 93 runs on Boxing Day and featured in his third century stand in as many matches with Katich, but was run out after a mix-up with Katich in which both players ended up running towards the same end, again falling short of his debut Test hundred. On Day four, Watson finally made his first Test hundred. He went to lunch sitting on 98* and including the lunch break was stuck in the 90s for 106 minutes. After the lunch break he got to 99, and was then stuck there and could only get dot balls. He brought up his debut Test century in interesting style, hitting the ball hard to Abdur Rauf at point who put the catch down. The ball spilled away and gave Watson enough time to run through for the single he needed. His century came after 293 minutes off 186 balls with 9 fours and a six. When Ponting declared, he remained not out, making 120. Watson was awarded man of the match on 30 December for his role in Australia's Test victory.
In the second innings of the Second Test at the SCG, Watson fell short of another century, dismissed for 97. During this Test, the Australian Cricket Media Association presented Watson with Australian Cricketer of the Year Award. [22]
In the first test of Australia's 2010 tour of India, Watson opened his account with his second test century – an attritional 126 runs off 338 balls on a slow, low Mohali pitch. The innings capped an excellent start to the tour, as he also scored a century in each innings of the warm-up match, albeit at a much brisker pace. He topscored again in the second innings with a run-a-ball 56, which proved vital in setting a competitive target as Australia's middle order again collapsed in spectacular fashion following his dismissal. During this period as an opener, he had the highest Australian Test batting average (50.40) for 2 calendar years. [23]
Shane Watson's record as captain
 



Early life[ edit ]
Johnson was born and raised in Townsville , Queensland . His first sporting love was tennis with his idol being Pete Sampras . [5] At 14 he was offered the opportunity to move to Brisbane to further his tennis career but turned it down. [6] It wasn't until the age of 17 that Johnson gave up on his childhood dream of being a professional tennis player and began focusing on cricket.
Cricket career[ edit ]
When Johnson attended a fast-bowling clinic in Brisbane at age 17, former Test fast-bowler Dennis Lillee identified him as a "once-in-nine-lives prospect". [7] Lillee contacted former team mate Rod Marsh and arranged for Johnson to join the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide . [7]

Johnson subsequently played for the Australian Under-19 side that toured England in 1999, however recurrent back injuries hampered his prospects. He recovered to start his first-class career two years later, when he was selected to play state cricket for his native Queensland . Playing for Queensland against New Zealand, Johnson hit a six off the first ball he faced in first-class cricket. In September 2005, he was in the Australia A cricket team that toured Pakistan .he generally bowls the sling action and has capability to bowl in excess of 150kph, his fastest being 156.7kph in Melbourne in ashes 2013
Johnson switched from the Queensland Bulls to the Western Warriors on 25 July 2008. [8] In February 2014, he was sold to Kings XI Punjab of Indian Premier League for AUD 1,160,000. [9]
Tests[ edit ]
Johnson was chosen to be in the squad for the first Ashes Test beginning on 23 November 2006, but was 12th man in all of the games. On 10 November 2007, while making his Australian Test match debut against Sri Lanka at his home ground in Brisbane , Johnson took his first wicket, that of Thilan Samaraweera , caught by Adam Gilchrist . Johnson went on to take 4/96 in the match. [10]
On 19 January 2008, Johnson scored his first ever Test half-century, against India in Perth , having been both dropped and bowled off a no-ball, although Australia ended up losing the match. [11]
On the second day of the First Test against South Africa in Perth on 18 December 2008 Johnson took seven wickets for just 12 runs, including five wickets for two runs near the close, to reduce the tourists from 3/234 to 8/241. He ended with 8/61 the next day. Despite this performance, Australia went on to lose the test. [12] Later in the series he made 64 batting with Michael Clarke.
The 2009 tour to South Africa saw an important development in Johnson's armoury, the ability to consistently swing the ball into the right-hander, which he previously had struggled to achieve. During the First Test, on 27 February 2009, Johnson scored 96 not out, to help Australia post 466 all out. This included one over in which he scored 26 runs off the bowling of Paul Harris , hitting two fours and three sixes, the last of which carried out of the stadium and broke the record for the most runs in an over for Australia in a Test match. He also took eight wickets with the ball.
In the Second Test, he unleashed a fiery spell of fast bowling that gained him two wickets in his first over, and three in his first spell, as well as sending both Jacques Kallis and Graeme Smith off, retired hurt. After this, notable cricket commentator Peter Roebuck described him as the best fast bowler in the world. [13]
In the Third Test, with Australia almost defeated, he struck 123 not out, reaching triple figures in only 66 balls. With tail-ender Bryce McGain for company, Johnson decided to take A maiden Test hundred
Returns to the Test team with a bang at Headingley, batting at No. 6 and scoring 127, his maiden century . With Matthew Elliott he lifts Australia from 4 for 50 to 9 declared for 501.

Early in the morning, with India pushing towards a big lead, Australia could have thought of only one saviour: Father Time. And so came an over rate of 12 to 12.5 for an hour. In a short spell, Shane Watson pulled out of his run three times. Without saying it was a deliberate time-wasting ploy, commentator Sunil Gavaskar couldn't resist having a dig or two. Don't know how the Australian papers, the sensationalist ones, will see it, though.
When luck becomes ploy
Mitchell Johnson was very lucky with the down-the-leg-side dismissals in the first innings. The way Virender Sehwag went for a similar ball to his first innings' dismissal it seemed an action replay was being enacted live. The ball from Johnson was shortish, hip-high, and would have been a big wide in a one-dayer, but Sehwag went for it, and barely missed edging it. That was on the first day, Johnson tried it to similar effect today. 'Australian for stock ball', eh? Just in case Foster's use it, they know where the copyright lies.
Suicide, and how?
Chasing 516, Matthew Hayden and Simon Katich came out swinging. The first ball of the innings was hit over mid-off, not convincingly at all. So while he scored 29 off 20 balls, he was not playing his natural game. He looked to manufacture shots, and minutes before tea he had tried one shot too many. The sadder part was, he perhaps pulled Katich with himself. The latter played a hopeless shot to give Harbhajan Singh two wickets in an over. One can imagine Hayden trying to muscle his way out of a lean patch, but whatever happened to Katich?
Why don't you walk, mate?
In the 37th over of India's second innings, Johnson should have had Sehwag. But the umpire, Asad Rauf, didn't think so. That was also the end of the over, and Ricky Ponting was seen having a chat with Sehwag during the changeover. Ponting did all the talking, and Sehwag did all the shaking of the head. Don't know what the minutes of that conversation were, but if Ponting had suggested Sehwag to walk if he had edged, it had some effect on the latter. The next time Sehwag edged, he walked. It was a thick edge, though, so he really didn't have any choice.
Cheer of the day
It was a sad moment for the sparse crowd when Sehwag got out in the 90s, for only the second time in his career. But he was entertaining the crowd and, when he was out, there was a huge cheer when, instead of Rahul Dravid, Mahendra Singh Dhoni walked out on a day India needed quick runs for a huge total before declaration. Not that the crowd meant any disrespect to Dravid, just that they found Dhoni a better proposition in the circumstances.

India v Australia, 2nd Test , Mohali October 16, 2008
Fitness worries and weather take centrestage
Oct 17-21, 2008

Big Picture
After the attritional cricket in Bangalore, where one team dominated much of the contest and the other refused to give in, Mohali - where the pitch isn't as slow as Bangalore - holds the prospect of a more lively encounter. Both teams will, however, need to rework their plans of attack to land the first punch in the series.
The challenge for Australia will be not only to get into a commanding position against India, like they did in Bangalore, but also to close out the match, which they failed to do in the first Test. All of their batsmen, however, with the exceptions of Matthew Hayden and Michael Clarke, made runs: Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey scored maiden Test centuries in India, while Shane Watson and Brad Haddin allayed concerns about an untested lower-middle order. Their fast bowlers, Mitchell Johnson and Watson in particular, showed that inexperience in Indian conditions was not a hurdle that couldn't be cleared.
Although India's batsmen played out the fifth day to secure a draw in Bangalore, the match was really saved on the third evening because of plucky batting from Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan. Their batting, however, isn't a major worry since most batsmen made contributions at some stage of the Test. India's biggest problem is the fitness of their captain Anil Kumble. He had a poor match in Bangalore, where he bowled 51 overs without a wicket, and struggled with a shoulder injury. He bowled during an indoor net session on Thursday but will decide on his participation in the Test only on the morning of the match.
The build-up to the first Test in Bangalore was unusually quiet. By the end of the match, however, tensions were simmering: Zaheer said the Australians were defensive; Ponting brushed aside the comments; and Kumble was writing indignant columns in response to media speculation about his future. Normal service, it seems, has been resumed.

Watch out for
Matthew Hayden: He made a duck and 13 in Bangalore, falling to Zaheer Khan on both occasions, and Australia struggled to score at three runs per over. Hayden's imposing style of batting will be crucial to the tempo of the Australian innings.
Michael Hussey: Hayden and Ponting are Australia's high-profile batsmen but Hussey is the fulcrum of the line-up. He scored 146 and 31 in the first Test and was done in only by big reverse swing and a freak doosra. His ability to string partnerships together with the lower order ensures extra depth in Australia's batting line-up.
Kumble: If he plays, Kumble will be under intense scrutiny especially after his outburst against the media. The Bangalore Test was only the third match of his career in which he failed to take a wicket. Kumble didn't bowl until late Australia's second innings and also dropped two catches.
Zaheer and Ishant Sharma: Spin was touted as India's strength in the lead-up to the series but Zaheer and Ishant took 13 out of 16 Australian wickets in Bangalore. They bowled accurately with the new ball and got the old one to reverse early and unsettle the batsmen.
Team news
If Kumble plays India will name an unchanged XI. However, if he pulls out India are likely to change their two-spinner strategy and play Munaf Patel as the third fast bowler.
India (likely) 1 Gautam Gambhir, 2 Virender Sehwag, 3 Rahul Dravid, 4 Sachin Tendulkar, 5 Sourav Ganguly, 6 VVS Laxman, 7 Mahendra Singh Dhoni (wk), 8 Anil Kumble (capt), 9 Harbhajan Singh, 10 Zaheer Khan, 11 Ishant Sharma.
Clark's elbow injury has given Victoria fast bowler Peter Siddle the opportunity to make his debut. He's been preferred over left-arm swing bowler Doug Bollinger to complete the four-man pace attack. Cameron White will hold on to the spinner's spot after a satisfactory performance in Bangalore while Simon Katich's solid performance as opener will keep Phil Jaques out of the XI.
Australia (likely) 1 Matthew Hayden, 2 Simon Katich, 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Michael Hussey, 6 Shane Watson, 7 Brad Haddin (wk), 8 Cameron White, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Mitchell Johnson, 11 Peter Siddle.
Pitch & conditions
It's been raining in Mohali but the forecast for the Test is more promising. "Heavy rains came down as recentlynners, something we rarely see with the Indian team. Perth, earlier this year, was a team performance, but not nearly as destructive.
Once it was India's mysterious spin bowling and imperious batting that undid opponents, here the biggest difference between the teams was the quality of the pace bowling

It can be argued the destruction started even before the toss. Perhaps Zaheer Khan had sensed in Bangalore that this Australian team could do with some dominating . The debate over who won the moral victory in Bangalore can continue but it's clear who gained more from that result.
Two moments summed up the match for India and Australia. One of them came early on the second day. India had contrived to keep Australia in the game on day one, even though the latter chased leather throughout the day. At 326 for 6, India were still capable of being bundled out for a below-par total. In walked Dhoni, and he got a bouncer first-up. He hooked that for four, then hit another for a six, and "the most defensive side in a long time" was being taken to the cleaners.
Then, on the fourth morning, India played Australia at their own game, applying ruthlessness and urgency - and clarity of thought - in their approach to setting the target, and giving themselves close to 130 overs to bowl out a side low on confidence. And when Matthew Hayden tried to intimidate the bowlers, they didn't take a step back. The inevitable soon happened and, as it usually happens in India, it happened too fast once it started.
Naturally Dhoni was pleased with his team's effort. "I've never seen anything like that," he said. "Especially at one time in the first innings, they were 22 from 13 overs. I said to Rahul [Dravid], 'Look at the board, we won't see that again.'"
The way this Indian team is playing, don't bet on it.

It was a pleasant evening in Bangalore after a rain-curtailed first day of the first unofficial Test between India A and Australia A. It hadn't been a pleasant day for Amit Mishra, though. He had been left out of the playing XI; Piyush Chawla and Mohnish Parmar, the Murali clone whose action has been under the scanner for a while, were selected ahead of him. When asked why he wasn't in the team, Mishra replied: "They had one legspinner already [in Chawla], and they went for the offie [Parmar] because Australia have many left-handers." The story of his life.
After close to eight years of first-class cricket for Haryana, one of the cricketing backwaters of India, it was his impressive showing in the IPL that had caught everybody's imagination. The IPL followed his best first-class season, when he got 46 wickets at 18.21. The A games (also against New Zealand A) were his best chance to push for national selection. Despite being omitted for the Australia A Tests, he was not bitter. Responding to a remark that the left-hand batsmen would stay, he said: "Tab to legspinner change karna padega [Then the legspinner will have to change]."
That was September 3, and by October 17, the circumstances had changed. Anil Kumble got injured and a replacement was required. Sooner or later the cupboard will open permanently for legspinning hopefuls, with Kumble at the twilight of his career. Mishra, fortunately, has already given India a ready option.
He is wearing a borrowed Test cap, but he has the heart to match the man he has borrowed the cap from. "How many spinners have made their debut for India, with the ticker showing 300 first-class wickets to their name already?" asks Vijay Dahiya, who has played with and against Mishra on the Delhi circuit. "It takes a lot of character, and consistency to do that." In the last eight years, he has come close, without actually making it. A member of the squad against the touring West Indies in 2002, he didn't get a game. He also played three ODIs for India in 2002-03, and was a forgotten man after that.
Even now, Chawla has been talked of as India's next big spinner after Kumble. When Chawla failed to make the cut, Pragyan Ojha went to Sri Lanka. All through, Mishra was barely considered, but as a testament to his spirit, he kept waiting.
Mishra's big heart shows in his bowling. It is a genuinely refreshing sight: a wrist spinner, on debut, throwing the ball up, giving it serious rip, giving the batsman time to think twice about the shot, drawing them out, and using the googly sparingly. The heavy bats be damned. Legspin is not the job of one who worries about the consequence. Even when he moved away from Delhi, where he wasn't selected for the Under-17 team in 2000, the consequences were not on his mind.
Twenty20 cricket is threatening to take the oomph out of legspin bowling, but even in that format he succeeded because he was not afraid to give it air, much like Shane Warne. It's fitting he bowled like the man who inspired him to take up legspin, after that mesmerising delivery which stunned Mike Gatting in the 1993 Ashes. "I watched it in awe, and it was magic for me," Mishra has said before. The Victorian Frankenstein had created a monster who would haunt his own team 15 years later, with a five-wicket haul on Test debut.
Only five Indians before Mishra have taken a five-for on their debut. One of them is a national selector right now, and he was seen grinning from ear to ear when Mishra bowled. The inspired selection was not the only reason for Narendra Hirwani's pleasure. Mishra reminds him of himself - the flight, the slowness, the turn. And even Hirwani tormented a formidable opposition in his debut, West Indies. "Bahut mazaa aaya hai iska bowling dekh ke [It was a big pleasure to watch him bowl]. More so, because I am reminded of myself when I see him flight it," Hirwani told Cricinfo. "Uska dil bada hai, aur pet khali [He has a big heart, and is hungry], such people rarely fail."

Hirwani has also worked a bit on Mishra's bowling, both before and after becoming a selector. One of the main criticisms Mishra has drawn in domestic cricket is that he is slow in the air, and that takes the sting out of the turn he gets. "There was a time when he looked to bowl faster, but I told him to play his own game," Hirwani said. "But the main thing was to keep the head still. When you bowl a googly, your head tends to fall a bit, and you sometimes continue doing that when you bowl the legbreaks. That way you push the ball through, as opposed to flighting it. I told him that the head was like a camera. Just like you need to keep the camera still for a good picture, you need to keep the head still to bowl legspin."
The head might not have been perfectly still all the times, but Mishra managed both types of deliveries to near perfection in his first bowling effort. His first wicket was a left-hander, Simon Katich, off a well-flighted legbreak. That was followed by the deadly googly, from round the stumps, in the last over before stumps on the second day. It was a delightful piece of bowling, as he got the ball to pitch in line with the stumps, and then brought it in a trifle, beating the bat. Michael Clarke had fallen in the last over again, like he had in Bangalore.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni had picked Mishra ahead of Munaf Patel, who had himself made an impressive debut at the same venue against England two years ago. That confidence didn't show when Dhoni refused singles with Mishra, the No. 11, at the other end. It wouldn't have flattered Mishra, who is a handy bat himself - his coach had to dissuade him from making a career as a batsman for the first two years of their association - but it perhaps goaded him to make his point with the ball.

Cardiff Docks —from where coal was shipped throughout the world
A view of the jubilee dock, Cardiff, from the eastern side, 1849
In 1793, John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute was born. He would spend his life building the Cardiff docks and would later be called "the creator of modern Cardiff". [31] A twice-weekly boat service between Cardiff and Bristol was established in 1815, [37] and in 1821, the Cardiff Gas Works was established. [37]
After the Napoleonic Wars Cardiff entered a period of social and industrial unrest, starting with the trial and hanging of Dic Penderyn in 1831.[ citation needed ]
The town grew rapidly from the 1830s onwards, when the Marquess of Bute built a dock , which eventually linked to the Taff Vale Railway . Cardiff became the main port for exports of coal from the Cynon , Rhondda , and Rhymney valleys, and grew at a rate of nearly 80% per decade between 1840 and 1870. Much of the growth was due to migration from within and outside Wales: in 1841, a quarter of Cardiff's population were English-born and more than 10% had been born in Ireland. [39] By the 1881 census, Cardiff had overtaken both Merthyr and Swansea to become the largest town in Wales. [40] Cardiff's new status as the premier town in South Wales was confirmed when it was chosen as the site of the University College South Wales and Monmouthshire in 1893. [38]
A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Maindy Barracks in 1877. [41]
Cardiff faced a challenge in the 1880s when David Davies of Llandinam and the Barry Railway Company promoted the development of rival docks at Barry . Barry docks had the advantage of being accessible in all tides , and David Davies claimed that his venture would cause "grass to grow in the streets of Cardiff". From 1901 coal exports from Barry surpassed those from Cardiff, but the administration of the coal trade remained centred on Cardiff, in particular its Coal Exchange , where the price of coal on the British market was determined and the first million-pound deal was struck in 1907. [38] The city also strengthened its industrial base with the decision of the owners of the Dowlais Ironworks in Merthyr (who would later form part of Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds ) to build a new steelworks close to the docks at East Moors, which Lord Bute opened on 4 February 1891. [42]
City and capital city status[ edit ]
Welsh National War Memorial
King Edward VII granted Cardiff city status on 28 October 1905, [43] and the city acquired a Roman Catholic Cathedral in 1916. In subsequent years an increasing number of national institutions were located in the city, including the National Museum of Wales , Welsh National War Memorial , and the University of Wales Registry Building—however, it was denied the National Library of Wales , partly because the library's founder, Sir John Williams, considered Cardiff to have "a non-Welsh population". [38]
After a brief post-war boom, Cardiff docks entered a prolonged decline in the interwar period . By 1936, their trade was less than half its value in 1913, reflecting the slump in demand for Welsh coal . [38] Bomb damage during the Cardiff Blitz in World War II included the devastation of Llandaff Cathedral , and in the immediate postwar years the city's link with the Bute family came to an end.
National Museum of Wales, Cardiff
The city was proclaimed capital city of Wales on 20 December 1955, by a written reply by the Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George . Caernarfon had also vied for this title. [44] Cardiff therefore celebrated two important anniversaries in 2005. The Encyclopedia of Wales notes that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales "had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal Conservative constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have". Although the city hosted the Commonwealth Games in 1958, Cardiff only became a centre of national administration with the establishment of the Welsh Office in 1964, which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the Arts Council of Wales and the Welsh Development Agency , most of which were based in Cardiff.
Redevelopment in the city's historic Cardiff Bay area.
The East Moors Steelworks closed in 1978 and Cardiff lost population during the 1980s, [45] consistent with a wider pattern of counter urbanisation in Britain. However, it recovered and was one of the few cities (outside London) where population grew during the 1990s. [46] During this period the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was promoting the redevelopment of south Cardiff; an evaluation of the regeneration of Cardiff Bay published in 2004 concluded that the project had "reinforced the competitive position of Cardiff" and "contributed to a massive improvement in the quality of the built environment", although it had failed "to attract the major inward investors originally anticipated". [47]
In the 1997 devolution referendum , Cardiff voters rejected the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales by 55.4% to 44.2% on a 47% turnout, which Denis Balsom partly ascribed to a general preference in Cardiff and some other parts of Wales for a 'British' rather than exclusively 'Welsh' identity . [48] [49] The relative lack of support for the Assembly locally, and difficulties between the Welsh Office and Cardiff Council in acquiring the original preferred venue, Cardiff City Hall , encouraged other local authorities to bid to house the Assembly. [50] [51] However, the Assembly eventually located at Tŷ Hywel in Cardiff Bay in 1999; in 2005, a new debating chamber on an adjacent site, designed by Richard Rogers , was opened.
The city was county town of Glamorgan until the council reorganisation in 1974 paired Cardiff and the now Vale of Glamorgan together as the new county of South Glamorgan . Further local government restructuring in 1996 resulted in Cardiff city's district council becoming a unitary authority , the City and County of Cardiff , with the addition of Creigiau and Pentyrch .

Dhawal Sunil Kulkarni is an Indian cricketer as well as first class cricketer . He is a right arm medium-pace bowler and right-handed lower order batsman . In first class cricket, he plays for Mumbai and in the Indian Premier League , he plays for Rajasthan Royals [1] . Based on his consistent performance in the domestic season and the IPL, he was selected for the Indian Test team for the away series against New Zealand in 2009. [2] But he was not selected to play in any of the three Test matches of the series.
In the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy , he was one of the key faces to make Mumbai the Ranji Trophy champions for the 40th time. He took 5/33 against the Services in the Semi-final, after scoring 20* in the 1st innings. He followed it up with 4/24 and 5/32 against 1st time finalists Saurashtra to bowl them out for 148 and 82, and thus ensure a win by an innings and 125 runs in the final. He was rewarded with a chance in the India A cricket squad. He was selected for the quadrangular series in 2014 where he played a key role for India winning the cup. Following this success he was selected for the ODI squad in England when India toured them (England).
He made his One Day International debut in the 4th ODI against England in September 2014.

Early years[ edit ]
Manjrekar was born in Mangalore in what was then the Mysore State in western India, on 12 July 1965(since his mother hailed from Mangalore); [1] the son of Vijay Manjrekar , who made 55 Test match appearances for India between 1952 and 1965. [2] As a school boy, he competed in the Cooch Behar Trophy between 1978 and 1982. [3] He attended Bombay University , [4] and played in the Vizzy Trophy and the Rohinton Baria Trophy between 1983 and 1985, [3] winning both in 1985, with West Zone Universities and Bombay University respectively. [5] [6]
Cricket caree generated huge turn on a track that had not afforded any spin for nearly two days. He went on to fox Cameron White and Peter Siddle with the googly. Although he took three of them with the wrong 'un, it was sparingly used. Shane Watson was probably the most satisfactory wicket, done in with a legbreak that turned a little less than usual. Watson had frustrated India long enough to give them nightmares about their past failures to mop up the tail.
The beauty of the Mishra story, though, is that the legspinner could change again once Kumble is fit. And Mishra's big heart will be tested one more time. At least he has shown that borrowed it might be, but the cap fits.

T20
Profile
Feisty and firm, capricious and correct, insatiable and insecure, Gautam Gambhir was one of the most complete batsmen between 2008 and the 2011 World Cup. He opened well in all three forms of the game. He could be more aggressive than Virender Sehwag, played the kind of back-to-the-wall innings that would do Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman proud, and accumulated without taking any risks, much like Sachin Tendulkar has been doing in the last quarter of his career. Either side of that period, though, lived disappointment with his technical flaws dominating his other attributes.
Gambhir almost didn't make it, "not wanting to play anymore" when he was dropped for the 2007 World Cup. For about eight first years of his career, he was the domestic cheque that would not be honoured at international level. While the bowlers on the Ranji circuit swore by this little left-hand batsman, he had just two international centuries to show after 13 Tests and 19 ODIs when he was left out of the World Cup party.
He came back with massive runs in domestic cricket, a few important technical adjustments, and with the reputation of being the best player of spin in India, outside the international side. A century in his second ODI back and a final-winning fifty in the inaugural World Twenty20 paved the way for his Test return. Test fifties against Murali and Mendis in the summer of Murali and Mendis in 2008 told him he belonged. In his next 13 Tests, he scored eight centuries: centuries to set up wins, centuries to bat opposition out, and centuries to hold on for draws, including the near 11-hour marathon in Napier. The Arjuna Award came his way, the ICC named him the Test player of 2009, but much more tellingly Sehwag called him the best Indian Test opener since Sunil Gavaskar. He scored a match-winning 97 in the 2011 World Cup final.
After the World Cup, though, began a more serious, almost terminal decline. As the Indian Test side went from sublime to ridiculous, Gambhir's failures went unpunished. In England and Australia, where India lost eight continuous Tests, Gambhir was a walking wicket, poking at deliveries outside off. From being a captaincy candidate at one time, he went to struggling to keep his place in the side.

Best Performances
119 not out v England, Old Trafford, 1990
England pile up 519 on a benign pitch, and India reply with 432. England stretch the lead to 407, and though the pitch is still good and the bowling (Malcolm, Fraser, Lewis, Hemmings) not terribly menacing, India find themselves in deep water at 127 for 5 with only one recognised batsman left. And he's only 17 years old. Tendulkar battles for nearly four hours, grimly but never dourly, and ends the day with 119. India lose only one more wicket, ending up with 343. With one more session, they might even have won.
114 v Australia, Perth, 1991-92
The fastest pitch in Australia has been reserved for the last Test. India have been beaten already, only humiliation awaits. Batting first, Australia score 346. Tendulkar enters at a relatively comfortable 69 for 2, but watches the next six wickets go down for 90. Tendulkar is the next man out... at 240. He has scored 114 of the 171 runs added while he is at the crease, and has made them in such an awe-inspiring manner that commentators are asking themselves when they last saw an innings as good.
169 v South Africa, Cape Town, 1996-97
Batting first, South Africa make a matchwinning 529. Playing only for honour, India find themselves groveling before Donald, Pollock, McMillan and Klusener. Tendulkar and Mohammad Azharuddin get together at 58 for 5, and start spanking the bowling as if they were playing a club game in the park. They add 222 for the sixth wicket in less than two sessions, and Tendulkar has 26 boundaries in his score of 169. Even Donald says that he felt like clapping.

155 not out v Australia, Chennai, 1997-98
Seventy-one runs in arrears, India start the second innings and despite Navjot Singh Sidhu's 64 find themselves only 44 in front when Tendulkar joins Rahul Dravid. The duo has to contend with Shane Warne bowling from round the wicket and into the rough. Tendulkar, who has practised against Laxman Sivaramakrishnan and a few other bowlers on artificially created rough patch before this series, decides to take apart Warne. In a breathtaking assault, with the match hanging in balance, he deploys his unique slog sweeps against the spin to steer India past Australia and snatch a matchwinning 347-run lead.
Century v Australia, Sharjah, 1997-98
India are chasing Australia's 284 , but more importantly they need to score 254 to beat New Zealand on net run-rate, and make their way to the final. Single-handedly, Tendulkar takes India close to the cut-off when sandstorms disrupt the play. Just when making it to the final looks difficult, Tendulkar not only takes them beyond that target, but for a brief while even flirts with a win.
134 v Australia, Sharjah final, 1997-98
It surely couldn't have got better. It does. Two days later, at the same venue, chasing a similar 273 to win the final , Tendulkar decimates the Australian attack. By the time he is out in the 45th over, he has left India only 25 more to get. Shane Warne is so devastated he confesses Tendulkar hits him for sixes in his nightmares.

141 and 4 for 38 v Australia, Dhaka, 1997-98
Six months after having destroyed Aussie bowlers' psyche, Tendulkar meets them again in big-match environment: the quarter-final of the ICC Champions Trophy. And again, single-handedly, he puts Australia out of the game with his third century against them in three matches. His 141 come in 128 balls, and India are 280 in the 46th over when he gets out. To put the matter beyond doubt, Tendulkar kills an interesting contest by dismissing Steve Waugh, Michael Bevan, and Damien Martyn in his 4 for 38. Tendulkar is clearly dominating Australia like no other single player has ever done before.
136 v Pakistan, Chennai, 1998-99
Few Indian batting performances have been as heroic, or as tragic. Chasing 271 in the fourth innings of a low-scoring match, India experience a familiar top-order collapse, and are sinking fast at 82 for 5. Tendulkar finds an able ally in Nayan Mongia, and rebuilds the innings in a painstaking, un-Tendulkarlike manner. After helping add 136 for the sixth wicket, Mongia departs to an ungainly pull, and Tendulkar's back is also giving way. Tendulkar shifts up a gear or two, and starts dealing only in boundaries. But one error of judgment and it's all over. Saqlain Mushtaq defeats his intended lofted on-drive with a magical ball that drifts the other way, catches the outer part of Tendulkar's bat and balloons up to mid-off. The tail disgrace themselves, and India fall short by a gut-wrenching 13 runs.
233 not out v Tamil Nadu, Mumbai, 1999-2000
It's a Ranji semi-final against a strong Tamil Nadu, and Mumbai are looking down the barrel after their bowlers have given away 485 runs. First-innings lead is crucial in this contest, but Mumbai look down for the count at 127 for 4. This is when old pal Vinod Kambli joins Tendulkar, and they see Mumbai out of trouble. But they are not anywhere near home when Kambli falls with the score at 266. Tendulkar then takes charge, and with the lower order, sees Mumbai just past Tamil Nadu's total and into a final Mumbai would win. This is just the kind of against-the-odds matchwinning knock that has eluded him at international level. Perhaps that's why he later says, "This is one of my best innings. This includes one-day internationals and Test cricket also."

155 v South Africa, Bloemfontein, 2001-02
On the first day on an overseas series, India's plight is a familiar one - four down for 68, with all the wickets going just the way the South Africans expected - to rising balls. Tendulkar has a debutant for company, with another to follow. He takes 17 balls to score his first run, but 101 come off the next 97 deliveries. It isn't the prettiest of Tendulkar's Test tons, but it is one of the most savage, characterised by pulls and vicious upper-cuts. The South Africans have a plan for India, and Tendulkar makes a mockery of it. By the time Tendulkar's innings ends, India are reasonably well placed, though they go on to lose the Test.
98 v Pakistan, Centurion, 2003
Tendulkar has been compelled to live this World Cup match against Pakistan for a year in advance. He has not slept properly for 12 nights going into the match. A target of 274 set for India, bat in hand, Tendulkar shows no anxiety whatsoever. Or is it that nervous energy? He just finishes his hyped battle against Shoaib Akhtar in the latter's first over with an uppercut for six, and then a flick and a straight block for two boundaries. Every bowler is dealt with similar disdain. He has not looked more pumped up before. And although he misses a special century, he leaves the match sealed in the 28th over.
117 not out v Australia, Sydney, 2007-08
Going into the first final of the CB Series, Tendulkar has not achieved many things: an ODI century in Australia, a century in 37 innings, a chase-winning century since 2001, a century in any chase since March 2004. In a 235-minute masterclass, he washes it all away, scoring 117 off 120 balls and leading India to the 240-run target on a difficult wicket just about solo. He dominates in the initial overs, shepherds the tentative middle order, and stays unbeaten to see the side home.

37 and 103 not out v England, Chennai, 2008-09
Tendulkar has to his name every batting record worth having, except one perhaps: a fourth-innings century in an Indian win. Having struggled against the spin of Swann and Panesar in the first innings of the Chennai Test , India are left to chase 387 on a deteriorating pitch. The explosive start, which puts Engl as October 4 and water, two and a half feet deep, collected on the surface which initially affected our ground preparations," the curator Daljit Singh said. The pitch hasn't had much sun in the lead-up to the Test and Daljit feared that there might be moisture under the surface which could make it sluggish. A spell of sunshine, however, should bring the bounce back.
Stats & Trivia
VVS Laxman averages 128.50 with two half-centuries and a hundred in four innings in Mohali. Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar also average above 50 at this venue.
The average per wicket in Mohali is highest for the third innings - 46.77. The average is 35.98 and 41.50 for the first two innings and it dips to 33.27 in the fourth.
Since 2000 fast bowlers have averaged 41.72 for their 54 wickets while spinners have taken 52 at 36.28 apiece.
India have won two out of the last four Tests played here. They beat England in 2001 and 2006 and drew with New Zealand in 2003 and Pakistan in 2005.
Quotes
"They obviously miss the quality of a Shane Warne and a Stuart MacGill. On Indian wickets you definitely need a spinner to come into play, if not in the first innings then certainly in the second. That's certainly something we will look to cash in on. Having said that, to win a match, we need to get big scores from the batters and every bowler has to contribute."
Kumble said on the eve of the Test.
"There was a lot made of the inexperience factor coming here, but all those inexperienced guys showed they are more than capable of performing well at international level."
Ponting says the inexperience of the squad isn't as big a deal as it's made out to be.

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 1st day October 17, 2008
Tendulkar breaks Lara's record
Sachin Tendulkar went past Brian Lara's tally of 11,953 Test runs
© AFP
 
At 2.31pm on a hot Mohali Friday, Sachin Tendulkar steered Peter Siddle towards the third-man boundary for three runs to break Brian Lara's record for most Test runs. The record stood for nearly two years after Lara played his final Test and it was inevitable that Tendulkar would eventually break it. As the day progressed Tendulkar scored his 50th half-century and became the first player to cross the 12,000-run mark.
The disappointingly small crowd, built largely of school kids, immediately got on its feet to salute the feat, and fireworks, which continued for three minutes, went off at the PCA Stadium. Tendulkar raised his bat in the air, took his helmet off, and looked up at the sky, as is his routine when he gets to a hundred. Almost all the Australians, wherever placed in the field, came to congratulate him. Ricky Ponting, the man most likely to challenge his status of being the top run-getter, was the first man to shake his hand. Sourav Ganguly, Tendulkar's partner at the nonstriker's end, reminded him that he was there when he scored his record 35th Test century.
This also brought an end to the soap-opera-type frenzied anticipation for the record. Tendulkar was expected to overtake Lara in Sri Lanka recently, but he endured a poor series with the bat, scoring just 95 runs in three Tests. Then in the series-opener in Bangalore, during a fine match-saving effort in the second innings, it seemed he would get to the record, but he gifted his wicket when 15 short.
Even today the anxiety around was palpable. During the time he got to 15, India lost two wickets in moving from 146 to 179 in 10.2 overs. While he scored at a fair rate, he didn't get nearly as much strike during the period as he would have wanted. While he played 23 balls, VVS Laxman and Ganguly faced 19 each. It was fitting, in a way, that he achieved the record against Australia, a team he has tormented several times in the past.
Coincidentally, Lara too achieved the world record against Australia, when he went past Allan Border's tally of 11,174 runs during the Adelaide Test in 2005. They remain the only three players to cross the 11,000-run mark in Tests. Though it is uncertain how long Tendulkar will prolong his Test career - which has lasted 19 years - the two players who stand the best chance of beating his eventual tally are Rahul Dravid (10,302) and Ponting (10,239).

India v Australia, 1st Test, Bangalore, 4th day October 20, 2008
Nielsen backs aggressive tactics
Share on Facebook Share on Twitter

The unsuccessful, wild approach by the Australian openers failed as both batsman fell in quick succession after smashing 49 in 7.2 overs
© AFP
 
Australia employed an unsuccessful, wild approach in their second innings because it was the only way the batsmen thought they could survive, said coach Tim Nielsen. After being set a victory target of 516, Australia were reduced to 58 for 5 on the fourth afternoon after openers Matthew Hayden and Simon Katich smashed their way to 49 in 7.2 overs.
Hayden signalled the tourists' intent by charging the first ball of the innings, but the momentum swung quickly when offspinner Harbhajan Singh picked up both openers in the over before tea. "Whatever India made," Nielsen said, "we thought that to be successful we had to have the mindset to chase it down.
"Trying to bat for nine or ten hours and just saving your wicket, or defending against the quality of the bowlers they have, makes it very difficult. Our challenge was to put pressure down by scoring runs and knocking the bowlers off their length."
The risky move failed badly and Australia now has only five wickets remaining after finishing at 141 for 5. The visitors still need 375 for victory or to bat for 90 overs to secure a draw.
"We had some success for a short time, but unfortunately we weren't quite able to get through," Nielsen said. "We lost two wickets in an over and the wind certainly went out of our sails."
Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin stabilised the previously frenetic situation in an 83-run stand, with Clarke unbeaten on 42 and Haddin on 37. Nielsen retained faith that the pair could negotiate the final day.
"There's a fair bit of water to go under the bridge tomorrow," he said. "They've played well for the last hour and a half, and they can get a start tomorrow India will need to bowl very well."
Nielsen refused to point fingers at his under-performing players despite seeing them dominated throughout the first four days of the test. "We're aware we've been behind the eight-ball for much of this game," he said. "We're working hard to get through this game and then after that we'll have some time to sit back and have a bit of a think about what we're doing and how we can do it better."
One major area of concern is the performance of bowling spearhead Brett Lee, who has failed to penetrate on the Indian pitches over the first two games. Ricky Ponting did not use Lee until after lunch on the fourth day, when he picked up Sourav Ganguly for 27, finishing with 1 for 61 off 14 overs.
"It's certainly not an indictment of how poor he's bowled," Nielsen said of delaying Lee's entry. "He hasn't got the results he would like, but has had some decent spells at times. "It's probably indicative of our whole tour at the moment. We can't quite put the pressure we need for extended periods."

The Allrounder
New Zealand had already lost an ODI to an ICL-depleted Bangladesh side, and on a slow pitch in Chittagong they were threatening to lose a Test too. New Zealand's attack looked toothless, the batsmen strokeless. Step forward Daniel Vettori, the captain who saved the ship. First his 5 for 59 off 36 overs (15 maidens) restricted Bangladesh; then he scored a half-century from No. 8 to ensure his side didn't trail by more than 100. Four wickets off 42 overs in the second innings kept the target down to 317. Then, in what amounted to a no-confidence vote to his batsmen, Vettori promoted himself to No. 4, aon the bowling and struck Dale Steyn for six to reach his century. Although Australia went on to lose the Test match by an innings, Johnson was named man of the series, with 16 wickets and over 250 runs in 3 matches.
During the 2009 Ashes tour he was criticised for his poor bowling and his lack of control. Johnson's position as spearhead of the Australian seam-attack was called into question, with match figures of 3/200 in the second Test at Lords and his demotion to first-change bowler in Australia's tour game against Northamptonshire . In the match against Northamptonshire, he returned 7/67 from 18.1 overs as Australia won by 135 runs. [14] Despite his poor form he was selected for the third Test. [15] Johnson consequently re-discovered some form in the fourth test taking 5/69 in the second-innings. [16]
Mitchell Johnson bowling in the nets in January 2009
Johnson bowling against India in 2010.
Johnson appeared to get back to his best towards the end of 2009, earning praise from captain Ricky Ponting during the summer series against both West Indies and Pakistan. He finished the year as the worlds top wicket taker (63), and also became the first Australian to take 30 wickets and score 300 runs in a calendar year. [17]
In the 2010–11 Ashes series Johnson took more wickets than any other Australian with 15 (36.93) even though he played only 4 Tests. In the First Test at the Gabba he was hit for 3/130 in the match and was so out of form that he was dropped. Returning for the Third Test at the WACA he hit 62, took 6/38 and 4/44 was instrumental in Australia's 267 run victory. However, his wayward bowling returned and Johnson became the subject of a chanting by the Barmy Army whenever he bowled; He bowls to the left, He bowls to the right, That Mitchell Johnson, His bowling is shite. [18] [19] In the Fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground England fans sang this as he walked to the crease and he made a first ball duck as England won by an innings to retain the Ashes . In July 2012, he admitted the jibes he’d received from England fans during successive Ashes series defeats had dented his confidence. [20] He has also, however, considered the choice to target him as a compliment. [21] Ever since his overall poor Ashes series, Mitchell Johnson claimed a spot in the South African series. He did not fare well in that series either, without picking up a 4 or 5 wicket haul, leaking many runs, and not contributing heavily with the bat. He picked up a toe injury, escaping being dropped. He did find himself, later that year, in the 3rd Test at Perth against South Africa. He bowled exquisitely, picking up the prized wicket of Hashim Amla and finishing with a four wicket haul. He also gained a place, in the Test series against Sri Lanka. Although he didn't play in the 1st Test, he was the man of the match in the 2nd claiming match figures of 4–79 as well as playing a brilliant 92 not out. He also played in the 3rd Test as an all-rounder due to Shane Watson's injury. He had a poor first innings with the ball and bat. With figures of 1–118 and only making 13, despite a fierce spell to Lahiru Thirimanne which, unfortunately, didn't claim any wickets. He did bowl well in the second innings, claiming the prized wicket of Dilshan and Thirimanne.
Before the 3rd Test against India in March 2013 , Australia dropped Mitchell Johnson, along with James Pattinson , Shane Watson and Usman Khawaja following a breach of discipline. [22] Michael Clarke, the captain, revealed that the extreme step had been taken as a result of repeated infractions which led to Watson flying back home and contemplating Test retirement. [23] Former players reacted with astonishment at the harsh decision taken by the team management. [24]
After a year away from international cricket, including being dropped for the mid-season Ashes tour of England, Johnson returned to the Australia team sheet for the return Ashes series in Australia. In the first innings of the first Test, after Australia ended with 295 all out (Johnson himself contributing 64), England were put under pressure by Johnson's intimidatingly quick and thunderously aggressive bowling style. After claiming the wicket of Jonathan Trott just before lunch on the second day, he then dismissed Michael Carberry , Joe Root and Graeme Swann in successive overs, engineering a dramatic English collapse from 2/82 to 136 all out. He backed up his 4–61 in the first innings with 5–42 in the second to seal a crushing victory.
In the next Test at Adelaide, Johnson produced arguably his best ever bowling performance, hurling down 150 km/h thunderbolts on a flat pitch. After Australia scored 9/570, England were steady at 3/136 at lunch on the third day before Johnson again tore through their lineup, this time taking five wickets in three overs and finishing with 7–40 as England made only 172, [25] as Australia won the match by 218 runs. During this match Johnson entered the top ten Australian wicket takers in Test cricket. Johnson continued his exceptional form throughout the series, finding the consistency he had previously lacked, and taking 37 wickets in the five-match series, which Australia won 5–0. He was named Man of the Series, having been Man of the Match in 3 of the 5 matches (the 1st,2nd and 4th Tests). He also clocked his fastest ball at 156.8kph, which made him the 3rd fastest active bowler (as of January 2015), and amongst 10th fastest all time. [26]
In his latest series against South Africa, he troubled the batsmen with his bowling as he took 7 wickets in the first innings and 5 wickets in second innings to give Australia an emphatic win by 281 runs.
During the first innings of the 2015 Ashes series, he picked up the worst bowling figures of his career, 0-111, where he was torn apart by England's batsmen. However, in the 2nd Test at Lords, Johnson recovered to take 6 wickets in the match and a run-out of Ben Stokes to help Australia to a 405 run win to level the series with England at 1-1. In the next test at Edgbaston , Johnson became the first Australian player since Shane Warne to claim at least 300 wickets and score at least 2000 runs. [27]
One Day Cricket[ edit ]
Johnson bowling for Queensland in 2005.
In December 2005, Johnson was selected for the Australian One Day International team, making his debut against New Zealand in Christchurch, with chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns justifying his selection on the grounds of grooming players for the future.
Johnson gave the first signs of his potential at international level against the strong Indian batting line-up in a One Day International in Malaysia, Johnson's 7th. He took 4/11 off just 4 overs, including the wickets of Sachin Tendulkar , Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh . Johnson then played in the Australian 2006 ICC Champions Trophy team, and in the group A match against England he took 3/40, including Kevin Pietersen . On 26 January 2007, Johnson took 4 wickets in 8 balls during the seventh match of the CB Series against England , for which he earned Man of the Match honours. In October 2007 Johnson helped Australia seal the ODI series in India. He finished as the top wicket-taker with 14 wickets, which showed his abilities, even on the slow pitches of the sub-continent. [28] In the fifth ODI at Vadodara he took 5/26, his first international five wicket haul.
Australia came into the ICC Champions Trophy ranked second in ODIs; along with being the event's reigning champions. [29] They opened their campaign against an undermanned West Indian outfit who were without prominent players because of an industrial dispute. [30] After being put into bat, Australia fell to 7/172 after 40 overs, before finishing on 8/275 in 50 overs as the pitch flattened out. Johnson scored a career best 73 not out, as Australia scored 69 runs from their batting Powerplay (between overs 44 and 49). In an innings which produced "fierce, clean hitting", Johnson struck three sixes and eight fours in his quick-fire 47 ball innings. Although Johnson went wicketless in the West Indian innings, he secured the man of the match award as Australia won by 50 runs. [31] [32]
Personal life[ edit ]
Johnson is married to former model and karate black belt Jessica Bratich-Johnson since May 2011. [33] They have a daughter named Rubika Anne Johnson, born in 2012. [34] He has a prominent Koi tattoo on his right arm.



Warner playing for New South Wales in 2008.
Warner is known for favouring the aerial route with his aggressive left-handed batting style, and ability to switch hit , using the back of his bat or by taking a right-handed stance. He is an athletic fielder and also a part-time spin bowler . His bowling style is unique in that he mixes off-spin bowling with his more usual leg-spin bowling. At just 170cms Warner generates his power from strong forearms and uses his low centre of gravity to get underneath deliveries and hit them high in the air. In a Twenty20 match for New South Wales in 2009, he hooked a six off Shaun Tait that landed on the roof of the Adelaide Oval , only a month after hooking the same bowler 20 rows back at the SCG . [12]
Warner's breakthrough innings for the New South Wales Blues came against Tasmania when he smashed 165* to record the highest one day score by a Blues player ever. [13] Warner later backed this up with a 54-ball 97 also against Tasmania to narrowly miss the record for the fastest ever century in Australian domestic cricket. [14]
This introduction to the domestic scene led to Warner being included in Australia's Twenty20 squad in January 2009. [15] Warner made his international debut for Australia in a Twenty20 International against South Africa at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 11 January 2009. Warner’s international career started in 2009 with a bit of history – he was the first man to represent Australia without a first-class match to his name since 1877. [16] He made an immediate impact, scoring 89 off 43 balls with 7 fours and 6 sixes, including the then second-fastest fifty in Twenty20 International history. [17] Warner was just 11 runs short of becoming only the second player after Chris Gayle to score a Twenty20 International century . His 89 was the second highest score on Twenty20 international debut; and the equal fifth highest score ever in Twenty20 internationals. [18] On 23 February 2010, playing a Twenty20 international against the West Indies at the Sydney Cricket Ground , he made a stunning 67 off just 29 balls. His 50 coming in at just 18 balls, breaking his old record of 19 and it became the second fastest 50 in Twenty20 International history after Yuvraj Singh . [19]
Warner on his T20 International debut
Warner finally made his first-class debut playing for New South Wales against Western Australia in the final match of the 2008–09 Sheffield Shield competition at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 5–8 March 2009. Batting only once and coming in at number six in the batting order, Warner scored 42 runs off 48 deliveries. [20]
On 7 October 2011, Warner became the first cricketer to score consecutive Twenty20 hundreds, when he followed up an unbeaten 135 against Chennai Super Kings with an unbeaten 123 against Royal Challengers Bangalore . Both matches were in the Champions League . [21] He made his Test debut on 1 December 2011 against New Zealand at Brisbane , Queensland in the first Test of the Trans-Tasman Trophy due to an injury to Shane Watson. He made a disappointing 3 runs in the first innings. In the second innings he scored 12 not out off just 4 balls, scoring the winning runs with a pull shot through mid on.
Warner scored his first test hundred on 12 December 2011 in Australia's unsuccessful run chase against New Zealand in Hobart . Warner made 123 not out in his side's second innings total of 233. In doing so he became just the sixth person to carry his bat through the fourth innings of a test match. [22] Warner bowls a Right Arm Leg-Break and on his first delivery in Test Match Cricket, the ball was dropped in the outfield denying Warner a maiden Test Match Wicket.
Warner playing for New South Wales in 2011.
On 13 January 2012, in only his fifth test match, Warner scored a 69-ball century against India at the WACA . At the time, this equalled West Indian Shivnarine Chanderpaul for the fourth fastest test century of all time, in terms of balls faced. [23] He ultimately built his innings to a score of 180 from 159 balls, setting a new personal high score in test match cricket.
Warner scored 163 off 157 balls at the Gabba on 4 March 2012 in the first final of the CB Series against Sri Lanka . He batted until the last ball of the innings. It was his first ODI hundred for Australia . He followed it up with 100 and 48 in the other two finals at the Adelaide Oval . Warner's aggregate of 311 runs was the highest ever for the finals of a tri-series tournament in Australia , surpassing Greg Chappell 's 266 runs in 1981. [24]
While playing for New South Wales, Warner broke the record for the highest Australian one-day domestic score. His score of 197 came off just 141 balls and included 20 fours and 10 sixes, surpassing Jimmy Maher 's previous record of 187. [25]
During ICC World Cup 2015 , Warner started the World Cup decently by scoring 22 against England and 34 against New Zealand. But in their fourth match against Afghanistan, he scored 178 runs off 133 balls, which became his highest score in ODIs, helped Australia to score the highest team total in any World Cup and the highest in Australia.
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
Warner was signed by IPL team Delhi Daredevils for the 2009–10 seasons. [26] During the 2009 tournament which was played in South Africa, Warner played seven games, scoring 163 runs at an average of 23.28 and with a strike-rate of 123.48. His top score was 51. [27]
In the fourth season, Warner was contracted by Delhi Daredevils for US$750,000. In the fifth season he made a century in 54 balls. Following the IPL 2014 auction, he was contracted by Sunrisers Hyderabad for USD 880,000. [28] In 2015, he was appointed captain of the Sunrisers for IPL 2015.[ citation needed ] Warner ended the season as the tournament's leading run scorer, rewarding him with the orange cap, although the Sunrisers narrowly missed out on reaching the knock-out phase.
KFC Big Bash[ edit ]
Warner made a record in KFC Big Bash by completing his half century in 18 balls against Tasmania. The earlier record was held by George Bailey , who completed his half century in 19 balls.
In the first season of the newly re-vamped Big Bash League, Warner was named as Captain for the Sydney Thunder and in his first match for the Thunder scored 102 not out off just 51 balls with a strike rate of 200 runs per 100 balls and set the record for the most career sixes in the KFC Big Bash League with 38, previously held by David Hussey .

Controversies[ edit ]
Warner in 2008
This article is outdated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.
(January 2015)
Former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe has called for a yellow-card and red-card system to be introduced to international cricket to curb Warner's "thuggish" on-field behaviour, stating that Warner was "the most juvenile cricketer I have seen on a cricket field". [30]
On 12 June 2013, Warner was dropped for Australia's second match in 2013 ICC Champions Trophy match against New Zealand following an attack on an England cricketer . [31] It later emerged that this player was Joe Root . The event happened hours after Saturday's loss to England at Edgbaston earlier that day. [32] According to the sports journalist Pat Murphy , the incident took place at 2am at the Walkabout bar in the centre of Birmingham , UK . On 13 June 2013, the Australian Cricket Team announced that Warner was to be fined £7,000 (AU $11,500) and would not play for his country until the first Ashes' test on 10 July 2013. Warner subsequently missed the rest of the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and the tour matches against Somerset and Worcestershire . [33]
Warner attracted further controversy soon after. On 27 July 2013, whilst playing for Australia A against South Africa A in Pretoria he was invond saw New Zealand through with a painstaking 76.
The Beginning
Peter Siddle made a breathtaking start to his Test career, against India in Mohali. At least it was breathtaking to the batsman, Gautam Gambhir, who found it's no picnic facing a man who chops wood for fun and is nicknamed Vicious. Second over of the day, Siddle ran in with the new ball, pinged it in short and caught Gambhir flush on the side of the head as he tried too late to duck. How does one follow up a start like that? Siddle went on yield seven runs in that first over, and sent down 43 overs to take 4 for 176 in match. As far as anti-climaxes go, it's not quite up there with taking a wicket with your first ball and then none ever again, but it's close.
The Debut
Before he finally got his India cap, Amit Mishra had toiled hard for eight years on India's domestic circuit, taking more than 300 wickets in that time. He knew he would get only one match, unless Anil Kumble didn't recover in time for the Delhi Test, or Mishra did something extraordinary himself. The first eventuality was not in Mishra's hands, but the other was: he produced a performance that dared the team management to keep him out of the side, bamboozling Australia on a Mohali pitch that had, until then, seemed trustworthy. Suddenly big spin, treacherous googlies and sly sliders confronted Australia, and they succumbed, handing the debutant a five-for. In the second innings, after the other bowlers had had their fill, he delivered the coup de grace, taking the last two wickets in successive overs. Mishra is an old-school legspinner, not afraid to throw the ball up, not easily put off by having runs taken off him, and it was a delight to watch him turn the ball longer and bigger than all the other spinners in the series put together.
The Allrounder II
Spare a thought for Shakib Al Hasan, the 21-year-old from Khulna. He had just had the match of his life, in the first Test against New Zealand, but ended on the losing side by three wickets. Only in the first innings of the four, when he made 5 out of Bangladesh's 245, was he not a key performer. He more than made up for that batting failure with figures of 26.5-6-36-7, the best performance by a distance by any Bangladesh bowler in a Test match. His 71 set New Zealand a steep target, but he could only manage two wickets in the final innings, taking his match figures to 9 for 115.
The Partnership
If India win this series they know when the momentum turned their way. They had a typically slow start in Bangalore , losing seven first-innings wickets while still 198 behind. Out came Zaheer Khan to join Harbhajan Singh, and slowly but surely things went pear-shaped for Australia. The good deliveries took edges and went through gaps, the average ones were thumped for boundaries, and the ones that kept  low were not on the line of the stumps. Every run of the 80 the two added frustrated Australia and inched India back into the series. Both went on to score fifties, and Zaheer rubbed it in , taunting Australia's attack for not being able to take 20 wickets.
The Test
This one had it all. After 43 overs on the first morning in Chittagong, Bangladesh were 44 for 4. Mehrab Hossain jnr and Mushfiqur Rahim then led their revival - Mehrab scoring 83 runs. New Zealand didn't make a spectacular start either, losing four wickets for 52 before Brendon McCullum came in and tried to fight drudgery with daredevilry, taking New Zealand to 99, whereupon three wickets fell for one run and Vettori had to fight drudgery with drudgery to limit the damage. Having secured a 74-run lead, Bangladesh made another poor start only to be rescued by Shakib, who added 56 with Mushfiqur and 48 with Naeem Islam for the sixth and seventh wickets to help Bangladesh set what seemed an imposing target. New Zealand made a good start to the chase, but lost Jesse Ryder towards the end of the day to make it 145 for 2. In came Vettori, presumably to see his side through to stumps, but he turned out to have a grander plan. He put on 40 runs with Aaron Redmond, 82 with Daniel Flynn, and dragged his side over the threshold. Bangladesh kept chipping away but in the end missed history by three wickets.
The Exorcism
The stage was set. Ricky Ponting walked out in Bangalore, in the first over of the series, his batting average in India 12.28. India may have had the psychological upper hand, but Ponting was dogged: he took the attack to the bowlers, hardly looking the part of the man who had struggled so much in India till then. It helped that he had come out to the middle early. His major tormentor, Harbhajan Singh, was still some way away. By the time spin eventually came on, Ponting was duly entrenched, and he took 37 off 46 Harbhajan deliveries, going on to make a redeeming century and taking the first steps towards eliminating the final hurdle between him and the ranks of the great batsmen.
The Drop
We've all heard of eye-popping catches, but spectacular drops? Welcome to the Stanford 20/20 for 20, where the low floodlights (because of the airport nearby) have been blamed for some dismally butterfingered fielding. Match two, England v Middlesex , featured two classic clangers. In the third over Murali Kartik dropped a regulation edge at slip off Ian Bell - a blooper somewhat explained by the fact that he had "more tape on his fingers than an Iraqi war veteran", as Tony Cozier put it picturesquely on the commentary. The piece de resistance followed 11 overs later when Shaun Udal bowled to Andrew Flintoff: the ball ballooned to mid-on and Flintoff began to walk back… only to turn and make his way back when he realised that Andrew Strauss had dropped it , in a howler so thunderous it was heard in Puerto Rico.

The Upset
On the 9th of October, Bangladesh took the field in the first ODI against New Zealand, still reeling from the ICL blow, and looking to control further damage within the players left behind. Some of their players had spoken, in the lead-up, of the millions they had foregone in favour of representing their nation. Fittingly they produced a champion ODI performance on a slow Mirpur pitch. The bowlers stifled the New Zealand batsmen, restricting them to 201. Mashrafe Mortaza took 4 for 44, and Abdur Razzak 3 for 33; five top-order wickets fell for 32 runs. Then the batsmen checked in: Junaid Siddique scored a patient 85, and Mohammad Ahsraful provided the impetus with 60 off 56 as Bangladesh got home with nearly five overs to spare. It hardly seemed an upset, given how easy it was in the end.
The Ball
Two contenders here, from the same innings, Australia's second in Mohali. First up, in the 11th over , Ishant Sharma got one to pitch on a length wide of off stump. Ponting lunged out to cover the stumps and leave, but the ball moved in with the shine. Ponting saw it and looked to get the bat down, but the movement was sharp and took the stumps. "It would get me 95 times out of 100," Ponting later said.
The second one was a bit of a waste, coming as it did to a tailender. Nine years ago Wasim Akram bowled a similar delivery to Rahul Dravid in Chennai with the same result. The time it was Zaheer to Brett Lee , who had just taken guard. It landed just outside leg, on a length, dipping in, but upon pitching moved away to leave Lee, who had been forced into the shot, and took the stumps. A very good, or very fortunate, batsman might just have got his pad in the way. Dravid couldn't do anything about it in 1999, and Lee was luckless here.
The Catcher
India Blue opening batsman Virat Kohli may have scored only 62 runs in the three games of the Challenger Trophy but he went a long way towards making up with four catches - one regulation, one good, one superb, and one spectacular - in the tournament. Of the last two, the first came in the final , against Red: an outside edge from Rohit Sharma off a full outswinger from Ashok Dinda that Kohli took, diving to his right. The peach had come in the game before . Second over of Green's chase; Irfan Pathan to Shikhar Dhawan, full on the off stump, angling away; Dhawand off track, is provided by Virender Sehwag, the final touches by Yuvraj Singh, but in the middle Tendulkar nurtures the chase, hardly ever looking under pressure, scampering through for singles like a teenager, breaking shackles every now and then with odd boundaries. The final one of those boundaries finishes the chase, and also brings up that elusive century. Works a treat that it comes at the same venue that was the scene of a supreme heartbreak nine years ago against Pakistan, and weeks after India faced one of its worst terror attacks. With Tendulkar, India smiles again.
175 v Australia, Hyderabad, 2009-10
Australia have amassed a massive 350 on a flat pitch in Hyderabad , and Tendulkar almost chases it, with no support to speak of. Displays through the innings how he has mastered the art of scoring quick runs without taking any risks. The only support comes from Virender Sehwag (38) and Suresh Raina (59), but they both look like getting out any time. Tendulkar, who scores 175 off 141 balls, gives hardly a chance through the classic. When he does take risk, it's worth preserving those shots in an album: the stepping out to spinners and lofts straight down the ground, and the unbelievably late flicks, even later late cuts. It all ends in heartbreak, though: in Chennai in 1998-99, Tendulkar, having played an innings as incredible as this, left the last three wickets 17 to get; on this night he leaves them 19 off 17. The rest choke like they did in Chennai.
200* v South Africa, Gwalior, 2009-10
It took nearly 40 years of waiting, but the accolade fittingly went to the best ODI batsman in history. Tendulkar overcame cramps, heat and humidity to play his most breathtaking innings, to send the cricket world into a frenzy. On a road of a pitch in Gwalior , Tendulkar began his innings with crisply timed shots past the packed infield. His placement was impeccable and not once did he drop anchor. Yusuf Pathan, MS Dhoni and Dinesh Karthik frolicked as well, but they were mere bystanders as Tendulkar continued with his act of savagery. He fetched 100 runs off fours alone and also ran swiftly between the wickets. He went past his personal best of 186, and broke Saeed Anwar and Charles Coventry's record with a glance to fine leg. A squirt to backward point got him to 200, and he ended up scoring almost exactly half of India's total.

146 v South Africa, Cape Town, 2010-11
At Newlands , India are looking for their first series win in South Africa, but with Dale Steyn bowling perfect outswing at mid-140 kph, often pitching leg and hitting off, they are in serious danger of losing the series. In reply to South Africa's 362, they are 28 for 2 before Tendulkar stages a recovery. With the semi-old ball, though, Steyn produces two spells of near-unplayable swing bowling either side of lunch on day three. Tendulkar faces 48 of those 66 deliveries, each one of which looked like taking a wicket. He defends obstinately, standing outside the crease to cover the swing and negate LBWs; he leaves better than others; and he releases pressure by taking calculated risks against the other bowlers. His 146 is the difference between a first-innings lead and a huge deficit; for good measure he bats out 146 minutes for 14 runs on the final day to ensure the draw.

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 3rd day October 19, 2008
Unexpected heroes step into the limelight

Eight days into the series, and the script has already been blown off course. The cricket's been prosaic rather than nail-biting, and some of the leading actors appear to have forgotten where the stage is. If you'd told Australia Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh would have figures of 5 for 399 after three innings, there would have been a smile as wide as the Nullarbor Plain on Ricky Ponting's face. If you'd told the Indians Brett Lee would take only three wickets at a cost of 66, there would have been few complaints.
Matthew Hayden, the run machine of 2001 and the scorer of three centuries in Australia last year, has 13 runs and two blobs to his name so far, while VVS Laxman, scourge of Australian attacks this decade , has just 54. Michael Clarke, he of the dazzling footwork and 400 runs from 2004 , has struggled to 40 runs in three knocks and his inability to pick Amit Mishra's wonderful googly from round the wicket late on the second day told you quite a bit about the anxiety that seems to have gripped his game.
Mishra will hog the limelight on Sunday evening after showcasing almost all the qualities you need to be a fine practitioner of cricket's most demanding art, but Australia's debutant, Peter Siddle, too impressed with tidy spells on a surface that was a world apart from what he usually finds at the MCG. Mitchell Johnson, seen as Australia's third pace option behind Lee and the now-crocked Stuart Clark, has easily been the most impressive of the visiting bowlers, and there have been encouraging signs too from Cameron White, expected to be a barely legspinning lamb to Indian slaughter.
Perhaps both teams have focused so much attention and energy on the marquee names that the guard has slipped when faced with the allegedly lesser lights. Australia have tried restrictive fields for Virender Sehwag, and then been surprised by the fact that Gautam Gambhir has picked off runs with almost as much fluency. India's bowlers have kept Hayden and Clarke quiet, but met stiffer-than-expected resistance from the likes of Lee.
For India, the emergence of a bowling attack that can pretty much take the surface out of the equation is a hugely encouraging sign. Both Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan have been potent with new ball and old, and their ability to get the reverse-swing going much earlier than the Australians could yet prove to be a pivotal difference in this series. Australia have Troy Cooley, acknowledged as the architect of England's reverse-swing triumph in 2005, but thus far there has only been isolated evidence of a plan being in place. Used to the Kookaburra ball in Australia, the Australian quicks, Johnson apart, have been comprehensively outbowled with the SG by India's duo.
 
 
Over the next two days, Australia need the big names to justify the pre-series hype, else they'll face the unedifying prospect of journeying to Fortress Feroz Shah Kotla - seven Indian wins on the trot - with their grip on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy as loose as a drunken handshake
 
Mishra too worked wonders on a pitch that was still almost without blemish at the end of the third day. Being vertically challenged, he has little option but to flight the ball, and he showed real character to stick to his strengths despite the odd loose delivery disappearing to the boundary. He spoke later of the selector who has also been a big influence on his career, but unlike Narendra Hirwani, who took 16 on debut against the West Indies in Chennai , Mishra wasn't bowling on a minefield.
Watson admitted that it was a beautiful batting pitch and that Australia had a lot of catching up to do with both bat and ball. The way he batted for his 78 - and remember that he probably wouldn't even be playing if not for Andrew Symonds going fishing - was a lesson for his team-mates, borrowing heavily from the Damien Martyn school of back-foot batsmanship that was so successful back in 2004.
Over the next two days, Australia need the big names to justify the pre-series hype, else they'll face the unedifying prospect of journeying to Fortress Feroz Shah Kotla - seven Indian wins on the trot - with their grip on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy as loose as a drunken handshake. Lee may have blown a kiss at Ishant today as the friendly banter in the middle intensified, but what his team really needs from him is a spell that blows theternational cricket. [11] [13] India's highest total, 218, came in the same match, which they won by 18 runs. [14] As of June 2015, the score is the sixth highest total in an innings by a team in a T20I. [15] The team's lowest total, 74, came against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2008. [14]

Domestic career[ edit ]
Patel took 6 for 55 in Delhi's first innings. This was his first five-wicket haul in his first-class career in only his second match. [5]
Patel played just one first-class game in his debut season for Gujarat , but had a more successful showing in 2013. Slotted primarily as a bowling allrounder, the left-arm spinner got his first IPL contract with Mumbai Indians ahead of IPL 2013, although he was on the bench for the entire season.
He was one of the key contributors to India Under-23s' title win in the ACC Emerging Teams Cup 2013, with seven wickets, including a four-for in the semi-final against UAE. [6] He was one of the consistent performers for Gujarat in the 2013/14 Ranji Trophy , finishing the season with 369 runs at an average of 46.12 and 29 wickets at 23.58.
In early 2014, he was named the BCCI Under-19 cricketer of the year for the 2012/13 season. [7] He had an impressive season with Kings XI Punjab in IPL 2014 with 17 wickets. [8]

Etymology
The origin of the name Bengal (known as Bangla and Bongo in Bengali language ) is unknown. One theory suggests that the word derives from "Bang", a Dravidian tribe that settled the region around 1000 BC. [7] The word might have been derived from the ancient kingdom of Vanga (or Banga). Although some early Sanskrit literature mentions the name, the region's early history is obscure.
At the end of British Rule over the Indian subcontinent , the Bengal region was partitioned in 1947 along religious lines into east and west. The east came to be known as East Bengal and the west came to known as West Bengal which remained as an Indian state . In 2011, the Government of West Bengal proposed a change in the official name for the state to Poschimbongo ( Bengali : পশ্চিমবঙ্গ Pôshchimbônggô) [8] [9] which reflects the native name of the state, literally meaning western Bengal in the native Bengali language.
History
Main articles: History of Bengal and History of West Bengal
Stone Age tools dating back 20,000 years have been excavated in the state. [10] The region was a part of the Vanga Kingdom according to the Indian epic Mahabharata . [11] Several Vedic realms were present in Bengal region, including Vanga , Rarh , Pundravardhana and the Suhma Kingdom .
One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is a mention by the Ancient Greeks around 100 BC of a land named Gangaridai , which was located at the mouths of the Ganges. [12] Bengal had overseas trade relations with Suvarnabhumi (Burma, Lower Thailand, Lower Malay Peninsula , and the Sumatra ). [13] According to the Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa , Prince Vijaya , a Vanga Kingdom prince, conquered Lanka (modern day Sri Lanka) and gave the name Sinhala Kingdom to the country. [14]
Era of the janapadas
The kingdom of Magadha was formed in 7th century BCE, consisting of the regions now comprising Bihar and Bengal . It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of the lives of Mahavira , founder of Jainism , and Gautama Buddha , founder of Buddhism , and consisted of several janapadas or kingdoms. [15] Under Ashoka , the Maurya Empire of Magadha extended over nearly all of South Asia , including Afghanistan and parts of Balochistan in the 3rd century BCE. [16] From the 3rd to the 6th centuries CE, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire .
Later rulers
Two kingdoms – Vanga or Samatata and Gauda – are mentioned in some texts to have appeared after the end of Gupta Empire, although details of their ruling time are uncertain. [17] The first recorded independent king of Bengal was Shashanka who reigned in the early 7th century. [18] After a period of anarchy, [19] :36 the Buddhist Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years starting from the eighth century, followed by a shorter reign of the Hindu Sena dynasty . Some areas of Bengal were invaded by Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty between 1021 and 1023. [20] Islam made its first appearance in Bengal during the 12th century when Sufi missionaries arrived. [21] Later, occasional Muslim raiders reinforced the process of conversion by building mosques , madrasas and khanqahs . Between 1202 and 1206, Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji , a military commander from the Delhi Sultanate , overran Bihar and Bengal as far east as Rangpur , Bogra and the Brahmaputra River . Although he failed to bring Bengal under his control, the expedition managed to defeat Lakshman Sen and his two sons moved to a place then called Vikramapur (present-day Munshiganj District ), where their diminished dominion lasted until the late 13th century.
Ram Mohan Roy is regarded as the "Father of the Bengali renaissance ".
Subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam throughout the region. [22] Consequently, the region was ruled by dynasties of Bengal Sultanate and feudal lords under the Delhi Sultanate for the next few hundred years. Smaller Hindu states, landlords and Baro-Bhuyans also ruled in parts of Bengal. The Bengal Sultanate was interrupted for 20 years by an uprising by the Hindus under Raja Ganesha . In the sixteenth century, Mughal general Islam Khan conquered Bengal. However, administration by governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence of the area under the Nawabs of Murshidabad , who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in Delhi . There were several independent Hindu states established in Bengal during the Mughal period like those of Pratapaditya of Jessore District and Raja Sitaram Ray of Bardhaman . The Koch dynasty in northern Bengal flourished during the period of 16th and the 17th centuries as well as weathered the Mughals and survived till the advent of the British.
Colonial era
Several European traders arrived late in the fifteenth century. Their influence grew until the British East India Company gained taxation rights in Bengal subah (province) following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, when Siraj ud-Daulah , the last independent Nawab , was defeated by the British. [23]
The Bengal Presidency of the British Empire was established by 1765, eventually including all British territories north of the Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh ), from the mouths of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra to the Himalayas and the Punjab . The Bengal famine of 1770 claimed millions of lives. [24] Calcutta was named the capital of British India in 1772.
The Bengal Renaissance and Brahmo Samaj socio-cultural reform movements had great impact on the cultural and economic life of Bengal. The failed Indian rebellion of 1857 started near Calcutta and resulted in transfer of authority to the British Crown , administered by the Viceroy of India . [25] Between 1905 and 1911, an abortive attempt was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones. [26] Bengal suffered from the Great Bengal famine in 1943 that claimed 3 million lives. [27]
The Indian independence movement
Bengal played a major role in the Indian independence movement , in which revolutionary groups such as Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were dominant. Armed attempts against the British Raj from Bengal reached a climax when Subhas Chandra Bose led the Indian National Army from Southeast Asia against the British.
After independence
When India gained independence in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines. The western part went to India (and was named West Bengal) while the eastern part joined Pakistan as a province called East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan , giving rise to independent Bangladesh in 1971). [28] In 1950, the Princely State of Cooch Behar merged with West Bengal. [29] In 1955, the former French enclave of Chandannagar , which had passed into Indian control after 1950, was integrated into West Bengal; portions of Bihar were subsequently merged with West Bengal. Both West and East Bengal suffered from large refugee influx during and after the partition in 1947. Refugee settlement and related issues continued to play significant role in the politics and socio-economic condition of the state. [30]
During the 1970s and 1980s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Naxalite movement damaged much of the state's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation. The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in the influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure. [31] The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress . The Left Front, led by Communist Party of India (Marxist) , governed the state for the subsequent three decades. [32]
Recent history
The state's economic recovery gathered momentum after economic liberalisations were introduced in the mid-1990s by the central government , aided by the advent of information technology and IT-enabled services . Since mid-2000s, armed activists conducted minor terrorist attacks in some parts of the state, [33] [34] while clashes with the administration took place at several sensitive places over the issue of industrial land acquisition, [35] [36] which became a crucial reason behind the defeat of ruling Left Front government in 2011 assembly election. [37] Although the state's GDP has risen significantly since the 1990s, West Bengal has remained affected by political instability and bad governance. [38] The state continues to suffer from regular bandhs ( strikes ), [39] [40] a low Human Development Index level, [41] substandard healthcare services, [42] [43] a lack of socio-economic development, [44] poor infrastructure, [45] [46] political corruption and civil violence. [47] [48]
Geography and climate
Main articles: Geography of West Bengal and Climate of West Bengal
Many areas remain flooded during the heavy rains brought by monsoon
National Highway 31A winds along the banks of the Teesta River near Kalimpong , in the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region.
West Bengal is on the eastern bottleneck of India, stretching from the Himalayas in the north, to the Bay of Bengal in the south. The state has a total area of 88,752 square kilometres (34,267 sq mi). [1] The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region in the northern extreme of the state belongs to the eastern Himalaya . This region contains Sandakfu (3,636 m or 11,929 ft)—the highest peak of the state. [49] The narrow Terai region separates this region from the North Bengal plains , which in turn transitions into the Ganges delta towards the south. The Rarh region intervenes between the Ganges delta in the east and the western plateau and high lands . A small coastal region is on the extreme south, while the Sundarbans mangrove forests form a geographical landmark at the Ganges delta .
The Ganges is the main river, which divides in West Bengal. One branch enters Bangladesh as the Padma or Pôdda, while the other flows through West Bengal as the Bhagirathi River and Hooghly River . The Farakka barrage over Ganges feeds the Hooghly branch of the river by a feeder canal, and its water flow management has been a source of lingering dispute between India and Bangladesh. [50] The Teesta , Torsa , Jaldhaka and Mahananda rivers are in the northern hilly region. The western plateau region has rivers such as the Damodar , Ajay and Kangsabati . The Ganges delta and the Sundarbans area have numerous rivers and creeks. Pollution of the Ganges from indiscriminate waste dumped into the river is a major problem. [51] Damodar , another tributary of the Ganges and once known as the "Sorrow of Bengal" (due to its frequent floods), has several dams under the Damodar Valley Project . At least nine districts in the state suffer from arsenic contamination of groundwater , and an estimated 8.7 million people drink  Indian top order away. And a little reverse would go a long way.

Shane Watson, the Australian allrounder, has said his team has not given up hope despite being 301 runs behind India after the third day.
Watson top scored with 78 in Australia's first innings of 269, but the visitors were further away by stumps when India sped to 100 without loss. An Indian declaration is expected during the fourth day, probably in the second session, but Watson was not daunted by the potential for a huge chase.
"I think we can win it," he said. "If we're set 430 or something in four or five sessions, I've got no doubt, if we bat well, we can chase down anything. The wicket is still playing well. There's a bit of turn and the ball will go reverse. If we bat extremely well, I really believe we can chase down anything."
Watson said the bowlers were disappointed to let India's openers, led by Virender Sehwag's 53, to race away in the 23 overs before stumps. "We know we're still in it, but we'll have to play two really good days of cricket," he said. "We're never down and out until the game is over."
Australia will need to bat a lot better in its second attempt after faltering against the legspin of debutant Amit Mishra, who took five wickets, and the swing of Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan.
During Watson's 73-run eighth-wicket partnership with Brett Lee, the batsmen were warned by the umpires about their verbal exchanges with the India bowlers. "They [the officials] were hoping it wouldn't get out of control," Watson said. "It was actually a lot of extremely friendly banter, I thought. Brett and me were having a great time out there, laughing. The quicks were having a good crack, as they do. It never was going to get out of hand."
It was a breakthrough innings for Watson, who is playing his fifth Test in an injury-plagued career, and he collected his first half-century. He remained calm in the mid-innings crisis when Australia were reduced to 167 for 7 and steered a useful recovery.

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 2nd day October 18, 2008
Mishra double gives India the upper hand
Sourav Ganguly and Mahendra Singh Dhoni added 109 for the seventh wicket
© AFP
 
India took the honours on day two in Mohali, amassing 469 and then putting Australia under extreme pressure by claiming four wickets before stumps. Sourav Ganguly, who scored his 16th Test century, and Mahendra Singh Dhoni batted in contrasting fashion to force Australia on the defensive, and debutant Amit Mishra struck twice to maintain the intensity created by India's new-ball pair.
Ganguly, who had struggled in the series against Sri Lanka, put on 109 for the seventh wicket with Dhoni to maintain the advantage built on the first day. Ganguly fell for 102 but Dhoni continued to attack, forcing Ricky Ponting to spread his field far and wide. Australia's bowlers struggled to make breakthroughs and most of their wickets came when India tried to up the momentum.
There was a lot of speculation before the series began that Ganguly wouldn't survive four Tests, but he is a man few can predict. Not long after lunch, he tucked Cameron White off his pads towards deep midwicket boundary and indulged himself. His hundred-watt smile and fist-pumping celebration was far from smug; and it seemed it was meant more for himself than anyone else.  He had scratched his way into the nineties, while Dhoni entertained at the other end with powerful pulls and drives, and his celebrations signified the achievement of a personal goal.
Ganguly batted with restraint in the morning, watching the ball carefully, playing late, and letting several deliveries pass outside off. He batted 122 deliveries yesterday, and wasn't about to throw it away. He didn't thrust the bat much, took the short-pitched deliveries on merit, and nudged the singles around. He began by pulling Brett Lee for four but was also made to look ungainly by other bouncers. His concentration never wavered.
Taking a leaf out of coach Gary Kirsten's book - keep out the straight ones and try to ignore the others unless you can cut or drive - Ganguly was an almost unnoticeable accumulator. His second century in Mohali came 11 years after his previous one here, and like that hundred against Sri Lanka, this was scored at a strike-rate of just over 45.
Smart Stats
Sourav Ganguly and Mahendra Singh Dhoni had contrasting approaches in their 109-run stand. Out of the 61 Dhoni scored in the partnership, 36 (59%) came in boundaries, while Ganguly's share of 42 included three fours, and 23 singles.
This was Ganguly's first century in 23 innings since his double-century against Pakistan in Bangalore.
Dhoni's 92 was his highest score in Tests in India, where he's played 19 innings.
Zaheer Khan dismissed Matthew Hayden for the third time in the series and for the seventh time in 11 matches, the most times he's dismissed any batsman.
Left-handers account for 77 (41.6%) of dismissals Zaheer's 185 wickets. They are also more likely to be bowled or lbw against him than right-hand batsmen: 32 [lbws and bowleds] out of 77 [wickets] compared to 33 out of 108.
Ganguly's stodgy approach, however, was complemented by Dhoni's aggression. He pulled his first ball - a short one from Lee - for four and then hooked Siddle for six before turning his attention back to Lee for two more fours in an over. Repeatedly getting inside the line of the short deliveries, Dhoni picked off runs into yawning leg-side spaces at a steady clip. He also waited for the ball, steering backward of point and driving in the V. His running was, as always, excellent and he urged Ganguly to be alert as well.
Batting remained easy, with no swing or variable bounce to speak of, and the two contrasting approaches from Ganguly and Dhoni frustrated Australia in what was almost a perfect morning for the home team.
As has been the case in the past, a shuffle down the track just after a hundred was Ganguly's undoing and Lee tumbled backwards at long-off to take the catch. The wicket was against the run of play, but Dhoni didn't let it hinder him. He passed 1500 Test runs, brought up his 10th fifty with a six over long-on, and hit three more later. He was the last wicket, lbw for 92, and gave the persevering Siddle his third wicket.
The Australians had spent nearly five sessions in the field and, when it was their turn to bat, Zaheer Khan ensured that Matthew Hayden did stay very long under the hot Mohali sun. He nailed Hayden for the third time in three innings - and seven overall - by forcing an inside edge on to the stumps with his third delivery.
A short while after tea, Ishant Sharma had a close shout against Ponting which Rudi Koertzen turned down. A few balls later another sharp inswinger hit Ponting on the pad, and this time he was on the back foot, leaving Australia 17 for 2. Zaheer and Ishant attacked through their opening spell and the change to spin didn't release the pressure.
Mishra's 18th ball in Test cricket resulted in a wicket. Katich, who had gone to 33 with some soft-handed strokes, played on.  Mishra tied down the batsmen by mixing googlies with flippers and pitching them on a length.  The spinners turned the ball sharply; Michael Hussey had one thick edge bypass slip and was reprieved by Dhoni on 25 off Harbhajan Singh. Hussey rode his luck to 37 by stumps, looking on as Mishra struck in the last over of the day, hitting Michael Clarke on the pad with a googly from round the stumps. India were without Anil Kumble in this game but Mishra has filled the gap impressively so far.
India's bowling efforts will, however, be a postscript. This was Ganguly and Dhoni's day.

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 4th day October 20, 2008
India tilved in an on-field altercation with South Africa A wicket-keeper Thami Tsolekile . This was deemed serious enough for the umpires to step in twice, however no formal complaints were made and Warner tweeted later in the day describing it as "friendly banter". Despite this, writers called into question his return to the Australia squad for the third Ashes test against England, which seemed likely after scoring 193 in the first innings of this match. [34] He was eventually forgiven and was recalled but caused huge hilarity when he 'hooked another one to Root' as he put it himself, as he was caught on the boundary by Root .
Personal life[ edit ]
Warner married Australian ironwoman Candice Falzon in April 2015. [35] They had their first child on 11 September 2014, a daughter named Ivy Mae Warner. [36] On July 15, 2015 the couple announced they are expecting their second child, another daughter. [37] On November 13, 2015, he led the team to wear black armband in honour of his paternal uncle, who passed away from liver cancer, less than a year since the passing of Phillip Hughes , and, by time zone, the day before November 2015 Paris attacks .



Domestic career[ edit ]
He is also a former junior cricketer for the Berala Sports Cricket Club in Sydney , Australia , who attended Homebush Boys High School also representing the school's 1st grade cricket team. He was known to wicketkeeper and bowl in the same innings during his time with the club. Mitchell Starc was also a representative cricketer of the Northern District Cricket Association (NDCA).
Starc debuted for his home state New South Wales in 2009, at the age of 19. His performances for Western Suburbs and the state 2nd XI earned him the elevation and he replaced the suspended Aaron Bird for the final match of the season. Starc, gained a spot at the Centre of Excellence in the off-season in 2009. In eight Sheffield Shield games in the 2009-10 season he captured 21 wickets, including a best of 5 for 74 against Queensland, and also chipped in with a half-century. [1]
In 2015, Starc maintained his dominance at the international level by breaking records in the Australian domestic one-day tournament , which came about due to postponement of Australia's tour of Bangladesh . The pure numbers from Starc's tournament underline his dominance: 26 wickets from six matches at an average of 8.12 and a strike rate of 12.3. [2] Starc was named as Player of the Tournament.
International career[ edit ]
After a series of injuries to several senior Australian fast bowlers, Starc was a late replacement in the team to tour India in late-2010, replacing Josh Hazlewood . Later Doug Bollinger was injured after the First Test, and that left Starc and fellow uncapped young pacemen Peter George and James Pattinson competing for a place. George was selected, and after Pattinson was injured, Starc made his ODI debut against India in Visakhapatnam in October 2010. He did not bat and was wicketless.
Starc made his Test debut for Australia on 1 December 2011 in the first Test of the two-Test series against New Zealand in Brisbane . [3] He took two wickets in the match, [4] and another two in the second Test in Hobart . [5] He was left out of the squad named for the first Test of the subsequent series against India , [6] but was recalled for the third Test on the pace-friendly WACA Ground in place of spinner Nathan Lyon , taking four wickets. Starc earned his first international call-up for Australia's 2010 tour to India , debuting in an ODI. In the Test series in India in 2013, he fell just one short of a maiden Test ton.
Starc was selected to play for the third test of South Africa's tour of Australia in 2012. Whilst Australia lost the match, Starc took 6/154 and achieved the second fastest test fifty (32 balls) by an Australian in Australia's second innings on 4 December. [7] Despite his recent form, he was rested in favour of Jackson Bird to make his debut for the Boxing Day Test against Sri Lanka. They would both be selected for the Sydney Test a week later.
Starc received the Man of the Tournament award in the 2015 Cricket World Cup , which Australia won, defeating New Zealand in the final. He also became Australia's leading wicket-taker across all forms of first-class and international cricket for the 2014–15 season with 60 wickets, including the leading wicket taker for 2015 Cricket World Cup, having played one fewer game than New Zealander Trent Boult . He also is the leading wicket taker in the world in all forms of international cricket for the 2015 calendar year with 88 as of December 2, 2015, after his ankle injury in the inaugural day-night test at Adelaide Oval. [8]
BBL and IPL career[ edit ]
In 2012, Starc was signed by the Sydney Sixers for the inaugural Big Bash League , followed by the Champions League T20 . In the 2014 Indian T20 league, he was bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore and quickly became their key bowler in the IPL 2015 edition. After missing the beginning of the tournament with injury, he came back and continued on with his good form from the World Cup. [9] During the 2011–12 Australian summer, Starc also played for the Sydney Sixers in the inaugural Big Bash League . The Sixers won the tournament and Starc finished as its equal third-highest wicket-taker with 13 in six matches. [10]
He was later selected by Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL 2014 auction. s * During the third test of 2013 Border-Gavaskar Trophy Starc became the first recorded instance of a No. 9, 10 or 11 surviving 100 balls in both innings. [11]
On 18 January 2015 in an ODI match at MCG against India he became the first Australian to capture six wickets in a home ODI match with his best bowling figures of 6/43. Starc was the joint highest wicket taker in the 2015 Cricket World Cup along with Trent Boult with 22 wickets at an economy rate of 3.58, but he was judged to be no.1 having played one less game than Boult. Starc was adjudged Man of the Tournament in the 2015 Cricket World Cup .
Starc took 26 wickets in the 2015–16 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup , the most by any bowler in an Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament . [12]
In 2015, on day three of the Second Test between Australia vs New Zealand, Starc delivered his fastest ball at a rapid thunderbolt of 160.4 kph and joined the 160kph club. This happened in his 89th over. This also made another record of the fastest Yorker ever bowled by any bowler, and the fastest ball ever bowled in a test. After bowling at this rapid pace, he soon started bowling 150 kph plus. One of which, at 154.8 kph, smashed the corner of Brendon McCullum's bat.
Starc is the first bowler to ball in a day-night test match ever, and first bowler to use pink ball in a test match.



T20
Profile
Zaheer Khan is an Indian fast bowler with all the traits that made the Pakistani fast bowlers a phenomenon. He swings the new ball and reverses the old, he does well on flat subcontinent pitches and relishes the helpful ones away, and he controls all three balls well - SG, Duke and Kookaburra. He might not quite have the skills of Wasim Akram, who he has often been compared to, but mentally Zaheer has become as good as Akram. He knows how to get wickets, he has an intuitive sense of when to go for the kill, and once a batsman has shown him the slightest hint of a weakness, Zaheer preys on it ruthlessly. Unlike the Pakistan fast bowlers of the 2000s, though, he stays away from controversy and is pretty low-key off the field.
Zaheer's career can be easily divided into three distinct sections, neatly segregated by injuries. He was all promise ever since he bowled Steve Waugh with a full delivery in the Champions Trophy in 2000. A mysterious injury in Australia in 2003-04 - hamstring at first and later discovered to be a nerve twitch - then tortured him for the best part of the next two years, during which he could not sort out the true nature of the injury. Every comeback ended in a frustrating setback through a new injury.
In 2006, though, Zaheer, now with a shorter run, a fitter body and a meaner mind, dazzled England with 78 wickets for Worcestershire, where team-mates started callingan tried to angle it away to third man. Kohli, at gully, threw himself full length to his right and took the ball one-handed.

Amit Mishra had to wait six years for his second call-up to the Test squad but the timing was nothing short of perfect and his performance the definition of heart. Handed a Test debut after Anil Kumble was ruled out by injury, Mishra, the 25-year-old legspinner from Haryana, picked up five wickets and spun Australia out for 268 to give India a 201-run lead. Shane Watson batted superbly for a career-best 78, the highest score in a disappointing Australian innings, but couldn't take his team past the follow-on mark. India chose not to enforce it, however, and their openers rattled off 100 in 23 overs, extending the lead to 301.
If India go on to win this Test their think-tank should pat itself on the back because the decision to play Mishra, plucked out of relative obscurity, paid off spectacularly. India bowled with determination and resolve through the day but Mishra was the pick of the lot. Short and stocky with an easy action, he bowled the ball slow and that earned him the massive wickets of Simon Katich and Michael Clarke yesterday. The remaining three came either side of a 73-run partnership for the eighth wicket between Watson and Brett Lee, and proved crucial in strengthening India's position.
India gained the early advantage by removing Michael Hussey in the first session, but Watson and Brad Haddin looked to be settling in when the persevering Harbhajan Singh struck. He bowled Haddin with an offbreak that went through the bat-pad gap before Mishra doubled India's joy by sneaking a googly through Cameron White.
Smart stats
Amit Mishra became the sixth Indian bowler to take five wickets in his debut Test, the first since Narendra Hirwani.
This is the third time in 96 Tests since 2000 that Australia have conceded a first-innings lead in excess of 200. India didn't enforce the follow in Sydney in 2004; the Test was drawn.
The highest fourth-innings target successfully chased in India is 276, by West Indies in Delhi in 1987 . The most number of overs a visiting team has played out in the fourth innings in India is 135, by New Zealand in Mohali in 1999 .
Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir were involved in a century stand for the first time in India's second innings in Tests. They have four century partnerships in all.
India were made to toil for over two hours during the one period Australia can claim to have dominated. Watson played a positive innings and remained in control throughout, timing the ball superbly through the off side. He leant into his drives and caressed the ball- six of his fours came on the off side.
Watson batted with composure despite the ball turning enough to beat the bat or strike the pad. He walked in after lunch on 39 with the responsibility of lifting Australia from 174 for 7, and was fortunate to be given not out by Rudi Koerzten, when the first ball of Ishant's post-lunch spell swung in and struck him plumb in front. With a couple to long-leg in the same over, Watson equaled his highest Test score of 41, and bettered it with a pull for six when Mishra dropped short. His fifty came with a cut behind point for four and the Australian dressing room voiced its appreciation.
Watson and Lee batted out the first hour after lunch, scoring 47 runs, and were nine minutes away from tea when Harbhajan was rewarded for tight bowling when Lee pushed hard and edged low to Rahul Dravid at slip.
Mishra was immediately called back into the attack, and he ended Watson's resistance on 78, trapping him on the back foot with a slider.  Soon after, the flight did it for Peter Siddle, who failed to get his back foot down before Dhoni completed a smart stumping. Mishra's 5 for 71 was the best return for an Indian bowler on debut since Narendra Hirwani's 8 for 61 against West Indies in 1988. Fittingly, the camera panned to a beaming Hirwani, now a selector, in the pavilion. Plenty had been written about India's persistence with two spinners, and Mishra stepped up commendably. He didn't get a lot of turn, but got enough, and his fearlessness to toss the ball up was refreshing.
Expectedly, Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not enforce the follow-on. Australia needed wickets but Ricky Ponting spread the field and started with one slip. Gautam Gambhir survived a vociferous leg-before shout off the first ball from Lee and opened up with a pleasing square drive. Virender Sehwag batted aggressively and received support from Gambhir who played a couple of superb drives either side of the pitch. India's 50 was up in 12 overs and, soon after, Siddle pitched the ball up and Sehwag slammed him over extra-cover. Sehwag's fifty took 68 balls and he promised much more on day four.
The day began with Australia in difficulty at 102 for 4 and ended with them facing the prospect of chasing a gigantic target.

Strength was Matthew Hayden's strength - both mental and physical. It enabled him to shrug off years of carping that he was technically too limited for Test cricket because of the way he played around his front pad, and it enabled him to touch rarefied heights of batsmanship. Before his maiden first-class innings, he asked if anyone had made 200 on debut, then went out and hit 149. The runs rarely abated over the next 17 years. Tall, powerful and equipped with concentration befitting the fisherman and surfer that he is, he battered the ball at and through the off side for days at a time. He has also made himself a fine catcher in the slips and gully.
Hayden's earliest Tests were exclusively against South Africa and West Indies, a trial for any opener. They were not auspicious, but patience and willpower won the day, especially after the tour of India in 2000-01, where he slog-swept his way to 549 runs, an Australian record for a three-Test series. By the end of 2001 he had broken Bob Simpson's Australian mark for most Test runs in a calendar year - Ricky Ponting first topped Hayden's 1391 in 2003 - and formed a prodigiously prolific opening partnership with Justin Langer. Belatedly he came good in the one-day arena too, and by the time the 2003 World Cup rolled around he was ranked among the top three batsmen in both forms of the game. Later that year he hammered 380 against Zimbabwe at Perth, briefly borrowing the Test record from Brian Lara, and in mid-2004 he was at it again, battering Sri Lanka for twin centuries that took his tally to 20 in only 55 Tests.
Weary through years of plunder and a difficult India tour, Hayden experienced an extended slump during 2004-05 and was initially replaced as one-day opener by Michael Clarke. His lack of form and footwork continued against England and his disastrous series only improved at The Oval with 138. It was the awkward beginning of a resurgence that extended his career and thrust him towards more middle-aged domination. Usually playing more patiently, he followed his south London renaissance with three hundreds in successive matches, becoming the third player next to Bradman and Barrington to score four in a row twice, and passed 1000 runs in a calendar year for the fifth time. After reaching three figures on five occasions during 2005-06 and adding 153 at the MCG a year later, he stood behind only Bradman, Ponting and Waugh on Australia's list of century-makers. With three hundreds in consecutive games against India in 2007-08, he quickly leapfrogged Bradman's 29, and had 30 when he waved goodbye.   Regaining the Ashes in 2006-07 brought tears to Hayden's eyes and he was also saddened when Langer retired at the end of the series, although his mood lifted when he won back his one-day place. In the final match of the 2006-07 Chappell-Hadlee series he thumped an Australian-record 181 off 166 balls, which included ten sixes, and showed his impressive power. More muscle was on display at the World Cup as he averaged 73.22 in scoring 659 runs, the most at the tournament, and he later revealed he was carrying a fractured toe and a broken bone in his other foot. A frightening 66-ball century against South Africa earned him honorary St Kitts citizenship and the outdoors man completed a dream trip by scoring another two hundreds, hooking a 136kg marlin and winning the World Cup for a second time.
A year later he was back in the Caribbean only briefly, returning home without playing a Test due to an Achilles injury suffered during training while on Indian Premier League duty. Australia's top order lost strength without him, just as it had when India ended the 16-match winning streak at the WACA. He had been keen to push on until the 2009 Ashes, but disappointing displays in the lost series against India and South Africa in 2008-09 prompted him to announce his retirement after the Sydney Test. And with that, he was gone.

Why India should seriously consider retaining Dhoni as captain for the rest of the series, whether Kumble plays or not
  shares 65
Kumble or Dhoni? The Mohali Test has made the decision all too easy
© AFP
Former Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy is a sceptic when it comes to captaincy. He believes any suggestion it plays a significant role in achieving victory is purely self-promotion by the fraternity of skippers.
For the benefit of the court I'm displaying Exhibit A, a video of Australia's second innings at Bangalore. Specifically, the period in the game when Anil Kumble was off the field and stand-in captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni led a vibrant India, a team that looked far superior to the one that performed in pedestrian mode a few hours later when the appointed captain was back in charge.
For the true non-believers this is Exhibit B: a video of the second Test, when Dhoni had the captaincy all to himself and a rampant India won by the biggest run margin in their history. Your honour, I rest my case for Dhoni to be appointed captain of India, not just for limited-overs and Twenty20 matches but Tests as well.
Yes, that's right, a change of captain mid-series.
It's not such a dramatic move if you consider the original reason for choosing Kumble as captain of the Test side. He was the ideal person to fill in for a short period until Dhoni was ready to do the job and also to avoid burdening the young keeper-batsman with a tough tour of Australia as his opening gambit in the Test captain's job.
Anybody who watched the Mohali Test and still thinks Dhoni needs more grooming has attended too many dog shows. Dhoni is not only ready, his captaincy in Mohali was a major reason why India currently holds the psychological upper hand in this Test series.
If India doesn't make the permanent change to Dhoni, they risk handing Australia a get-out-of-jail card. Whether Australia is in the right frame of mind to put that card to full use in this series is another question, but why would India want to dig an escape tunnel and chance their opponents stumbling upon it?
The best way to beat a good team is to attack them and try to provoke mistakes. In Bangalore, Kumble played a waiting game and Australia prospered, while in Mohali, Dhoni went on the offensive from the moment he won the toss, which helped send his opponents crashing to defeat.
There's no doubt winning the toss made a huge difference, and having Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir set off aggressively also helped, but Dhoni did plenty to assist his own and the team's cause. Most importantly he created an atmosphere where the players enjoyed the contest. Sehwag was a classic example. He had a smile from start to finish, enjoying his team-mates' success and revelling in the fact that India was playing an aggressive brand of cricket. Dhoni is wise to involve his team in an exciting contest where victory is sought from the first ball, because it galvanises the better players in his team.
Zaheer Khan was like a man possessed, heavily involved in placing his field, and Sachin Tendulkar behaved like an exuberant 18-year-old when he took a vital catch in the second innings. However, the most conclusive evidence that Dhoni had created a winning atmosphere came from the opposing captain.
After the match Ricky Ponting said that India had outplayed his side from start to finish in all aspects, even fielding. An aging Indian side outfielding an athletic Australian side - the next thing you know, Dhoni will be turning water into wine.
Whether the Indian selectors choose Kumble as a bowler for the third Test is dependent on whether he's fit enough to perform near his best. If he is, then he returns to the team because he has been a warrior for India and has brought great credit to himself and his country.
It would be a blessing in disguise to relieve Kumble of the captaincy so he can just concentrate on bowling well and rounding out a wonderful career in a manner befitting a successful and classy cricketer.
It has been said that good captaincy is like pornography - it's hard to define but you know it when you see it. Usually when you do see it, a victory soon follows and after Dhoni's great performance at Mohali, it might be the right time to ask Healy if he still thinks good captaincy doesn't affect the result of a match.

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 5th day October 21, 2008
There's something about Dhoni

There's something about Mahendra Singh Dhoni. His detractors call it luck, but whatever it is, it has worked. Twice this year, he has been told about half an hour before a Test that he will have to lead the side, and twice India have won comprehensively under him. If in Mohali, as he admitted, he was lucky to win the toss; in Kanpur , India won despite batting last on a crumbling spinners' paradise. If at all, he has been lucky that his players have produced special performances: Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman conducted a workshop on batting on bad pitches in Kanpur, and Dhoni got special performances from nine of the players in Mohali.
His 100% win record is safe but Dhoni isn't shouting triumphantly from the rooftops just yet. "Playing [just] one Test and hitting a half century, you get an average of 50. So is the case if you hit a 100," Dhoni said, moments after securing India's biggest victory in terms of runs. "Your performance is counted over a longer duration of the game. I got my chance here but it was a team effort."
Dhoni, however, has the Midas touch and it was summed up best when he asked the debutant Amit Mishra to go round the stumps in the last over of the second day. Mishra bowled an accurate wrong'un to trap Michael Clarke in front and one was reminded of the ploy to give Joginder Sharma the final over of the World Twenty20 final. But Dhoni, to the amusement of all present, only said, "Fluke tha yaar [It was a fluke]."
What wasn't a fluke, though, was how Dhoni batted. He infused urgency into India's mindset with his aggressive approach and timely changes to the batting order. He had batted defensively in Bangalore and failed miserably, but in Mohali, he hooked his first ball for four - a statement tha him Zippy Zakky. He was the perfect foil for Sreesanth in South Africa, and he then regained his status as leader of the pack with a matchwinning display at Trent Bridge, as India won only their fifth Test on English soil. The new, lethal Zaheer was not only the leader of the Indian attack, he was one of the best in the world. Already the second-most successful Indian pace bowler, if Zaheer keeps injuries at bay, he could end up as India's most complete fast bowler of all time.

The first glitch comes in the one-day format leading up to the 2007 World Cup. His calm outlook, strong team qualities and ability to perform in most situations had helped earn him the captaincy for the Chappell-Hadlee Series, but it quickly becomes a tournament to forget with three severe losses. At the World Cup his first four entries are single figures and he finishes with 87 runs for the tournament.

148 v Pakistan, Visakhapatman, 2004-05
Dhoni is playing his fifth ODI and walks in at No. 3 after Sachin Tendulkar has fallen in the fourth over. The pitch is flat, and Dhoni cashes in in a spectacular manner. He scores his maiden ODI century, 148 off 123 balls with 15 fours and four sixes, and by the time he's done Virender Sehwag's 74 off 40 balls has been overshadowed. It is the highest score by an Indian wicketkeeper - barring Rahul Dravid - and by the time Dhoni is out, India are 289 for 4 in the 42nd over.

India's top order set the table, and two of Australia's familiar tormenters tucked in to leave the home side five wickets away from a crushing win, and the series lead, against the No. 1 side in the world. Gautam Gambhir scored his second century - and first at home - while Virender Sehwag and Mahendra Singh Dhoni raced to half-centuries to set Australia a mammoth 516 in a little over four sessions.
To drive home their advantage, India dismissed Australia's openers in the last over before tea, tore the heart out of their middle order, and had them haemorrhaging at 141 for 5 . Harbhajan Singh, who took 3 for 23, and Ishant Sharma had once again turned on the heat when India needed it most.
Australia had launched a spirited chase for seven overs, racing to 49, but Harbhajan's double-wicket over before tea stunned them. Matthew Hayden, who had begun in one-day mode, tried to sweep and was lbw for 29. Three balls later Simon Katich, losing his composure, threw his bat at a flighted delivery and was superbly caught by Sachin Tendulkar, who had to dive forward to take the catch inches off the grass. The wickets had come in Harbhajan's first over, an inspired bowling change by Dhoni after the new-ball bowlers had been expensive.
Harbhajan tossed it up more than usual but a shooter brought him his third wicket soon after tea. The length was short and the ball skidded through to Michael Hussey who suffered from poor shot selection: he tried to pull but was hit plumb in front. The wicket sparked manic celebrations in Mohali for it was Harbhajan's 299th.
The decisive blow came in the next over. Ricky Ponting was new to the crease and his feet hadn't even started moving when his off stump was flattened by Ishant Sharma who found the bat-pad gap with a full ball. It was the third time that Sharma had dismissed Ponting in the series, and the fifth overall. Shane Watson was the next to go, hit in front by one that nipped into him from Ishant, and was the fifth wicket to fall in the space of nine runs. Ishant achieved significant movement both in the air and off the pitch and had 2 for 29 to show for his efforts.
Smart Stats
Australia have lost each time they've been set a target of 500 or above. Their heaviest defeat came against England in 1928, when they lost by 675 runs.
Gautam Gambhir's century was his second , and his first in India. Gambhir got starts in his previous nine innings, which included four fifties, and averaged 47.45, but failed to convert them into hundreds.
Ishant Sharma dismissed Ricky Ponting for the fifth time in as many Tests. Ponting averages 18.80 against Ishant in eight innings.
Harbhajan Singh dismissed Matthew Hayden for the eighth time in as many Tests, more than any other bowler. It was the first time he trapped Hayden lbw.
Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir's stand of 182 fell just ten runs short of equalling India's record for the first wicket partnership against Australia - Sunil Gavaskar and Chetan Chauhan had added 192 in Mumbai in 1979. ( Click here for the full list.) The stand is also India's highest opening partnership in the second innings of a home Test, and the fourth-highest in all second innings.
A dogged 83-run partnership in 29.3 overs between Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin denied India any more success, but there was no denying who's day it was.
Unlike the Indians, Australia's bowlers could find no assistance in the pitch and struggled to contain the batsmen as they pursued quick runs. When play began, Gambhir and Sehwag made sure the platform built over three days was not wasted. Both openers found the gaps in the field with ease because Ponting had several men on the boundary.
Gambhir was fortunate to survive a thick edge off Cameron White, which brushed the wicketkeeper's pads and was spilled by Hayden at slip, but there was nothing fortuitous about a twinkle-toed six off the legspinner which sailed over long-on. The ball didn't always come onto Sehwag's bat but he repeatedly tried to whip it between midwicket and mid-on. Apart from the powerful shots, Sehwag and Gambhir also dropped the ball with soft hands and ran swiftly between the wickets. Sehwag fell with a rare second-innings hundred in his sights, edging Peter Siddle to Haddin on 90.
India held Rahul Dravid back and Dhoni walked in at No 3 to continue the morning's aggression. He ran hard and hit the ball even harder. His unbeaten 68 was his second half-century of the match.
Gambhir's previous best in India was 96 against South Africa in 2004, and the wait for a hundred ended with a lavish clip past mid-on for four. However, he chipped White to mid-off soon after reaching his hundred but had ensured India's advantage. Dhoni added 66 with Sourav Ganguly, who was last out for 27, after the lead passed 500.
Australia have been set a target of 500 or more on six occasions and they've lost each time. With only five wickets in hand, the odds are in favour of a seventh.

What was a swamp with deep ravines in 1992 was turned into India's best stadium within a span of two years. The Punjab Cricket Association Stadium at Mohali, on the outskirts of Chandigarh, is a truly world-class venue with excellent practice facilities, spectator-friendly outlook and sufficient provisions for the media. The pitch at Mohali had the reputation of being the livliest in the country - India were even rolled over for 83 on the first morning against New Zealand in 1999 - but it changed complexion drastically over the next few years and turned into a dead pitch producing high-scoring draws. There have also been some cracking one-dayers played on this ground, the most thrilling being the World Cup semi-final in 1996 when Australia squeezed past West Indies in a nail-biting finish.

A tall left-handed opener who batted with his bottom inelegantly stuck out towards square-leg, Chris Broad was an unusually single-minded and  ambitious county cricketer. His occasional gracelessness was the flip-side of his impressive determination, and in 1983 he left his home-town club Gloucestershire for Nottinghamshire, whingeing that their unambitiousness had held him back. England rewarded this theoretically  frowned-on move by picking him at once. This paid off spectacularly  against the weak Australian team of 1986-87 when Broad equalled Jack  Hobbs and Wally Hammond by scoring centuries in three successive  Tests of an Ashes series.  He scored a further 139 in the dreary Sydney bicentenary Test a year  later but smashed the stumps down after being bowled. And when he  was seen mouthing off after being given lbw at Lord's, he was dropped -  ostensibly for loss of form, but the England management was getting  increasingly tough-minded after the free-for-all of the Ian Botham era,  and petulance was out of fashion: Broad only ever played two more  Tests. Later, he became more serene but less effective, returning in peace to Gloucestershire and then joining the BBC TV commentary team before it was disbanded. His commentary was as well-honed as his batting, though his flair for it was less obvious. His subsequent reincarnation as an ICC match referee was a classic poacher-turned-gamekeeper situation.

To conquer international cricket, Shane Watson first had to beat his fragile body. Despite boasting an athletic figure made for photo shoots, Watson's frame was so brittle it threatened to break him. He refused to give up. Not through recurrences of back stress fractures, hamstring strains, calf problems, hip complaints, a dislocated shoulder or a suspected heart attack that turned out to be food poisoning. He changed his training, preferring pilates to weights, gave up alcohol, but not his dream. It finally paid off in 2009, when he was chosen as a Test opener in the middle of the Ashes series. Many batsmen would have been uncomfortable with the promotion from the middle order, especially after failing when given the job with Queensland, but Watson had become used to re-inventing himself. With a history of setbacks, it was not a surprise that his first Test century became such a drama, but after two scores in the 90s and an 89, he finally brought it up at the MCG against Pakistan - thanks to a single from a dropped catch. He had earned some luck. A productive few years as a Test opener led to back-to-back Allan Border Medals but by 2011-12, injury had again interceded. He returned to the Test team in 2012 but spent the rest of his career floating up and down the order in search of a place to call his own.
In 2013, Watson became Australia's 44th Test captain when he led the team to a three-day loss in Delhi in place of the injured Michael Clarke. It completed a hectic couple of weeks for Watson, who had been suspended from the previous Test in the homework saga and had also flown home for the birth of his child. He gave up the vice-captaincy after that tour and played for another two years before being dropped during the 2015 Ashes, after which he announced his retirement from Tests. As a bowler, Watson developed into one of Australia's best exponents of reverse swing, and if he was not claiming wickets himself he was often building pressure at one end. At times his bowling saved his place in the Test team, for four centuries from 59 Tests and an average of 35.19 was a little less than he desired as a batsman. At the crease he is an aggressive brute with a broad chest, a right-handed disciple of Matthew Hayden, and someone who often doesn't need to follow-through to gain a boundary. However, his drives and pulls are delivered in a much smoother style. Always a dangerous striker in the shorter formats, Watson clubbed Bangladesh for 185 in a 50-over contest in April 2011, the highest score ever by an Australian batsman in ODI cricket.

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 5th day October 21, 2008
Utterly outclassed
Stats highlights from the second Test between India and Australia in Mohali

The Mohali result was a remarkable one for many reasons: it was India's biggest Test win and Australia's heaviest defeat against India (both in terms of runs), but almost as significant as the margin of the result was the manner in which the two teams played.
The Australian template has always been to play attacking cricket, score quickly, and then strangle the opponents with accurate bowling and tight fielding. Before the series started, Ricky Ponting talked up Australia's new-age cricket, and said India played the old-fashioned way. He was, quite justifiably, upbeat about Australia's ability to take quick singles, put pressure on opposition fielders, and deny the opposition batsmen the same luxury with a ring of agile in-fielders.
In this Test, though, the role reversal was complete. India scored 783 runs in 1164 balls, a scoring rate of 4.03 per over, while Australia's run-rate was a poor 2.78. The difference of 1.25 runs per over is the second-highest for a Test involving Australia since 1990. The only occasion the margin was greater was more than ten years back, also against India, in Kolkata, when Australia lost by an innings and 219 runs.

A batsman of great talent and enormous ambition, Michael Clarke emerged in Australia's golden years, was with them through the troughs that followed, and eventually led them back to the No.1 Test ranking. At his peak Clarke was ranked the best Test batsman in the world, testament not only to his skill but his hard work in overcoming a chronic back injury that caused him progressively more trouble as his career advanced. Also an intuitive, aggressive captain, Clarke took over from Ricky Ponting in 2011 and while the team did not always run harmoniously during his tenure, he was at the helm for an Ashes whitewash in 2013-14 and a World Cup triumph in 2015. His retirement came at the end of a lost Ashes campaign in England in 2015, but he could be satisfied with a career punctuated by fine achievements.
As a young man Clarke could do anything with the bat, but he matured into one of the game's most professional, reliable and focussed players. A year into his Test career he learnt that he had to shed the flourishes that made him a golden child in order to shine consistently at elite level. Breathtaking centuries on debut away and at home stamped him as a shot-maker to savour, but his method in later years was to find gaps by caressing the ball along the ground. In the field his throw was as fast and accurate as anything in the game, and he could winkle out batsmen with his disarming left-arm spin.
Mostly he became known for his immaculate driving and slicing of the ball through impossible angles. His peak year was 2012, which brought 1595 runs at 106.33 and stamped him as the most in-form batsman in the world. The year began with a monumental 329 not out against India at the SCG and continued with 210 in Adelaide, where he joined Wally Hammond and Don Bradman as the only men to score a triple-century and a double-hundred in the same series. Later in the year came back-to-back double-centuries against South Africa in Brisbane and Adelaide. There seemed little he could not do.
But the team harmony disintegrated on the tour of India that followed in 2013, when Clarke and coach Mickey Arthur suspended four players in what became known as the homework saga. The Ashes series in England was then lost, but Clarke's Australians regained the urn with a 5-0 clean sweep in Australia at the end of the year. Clarke's gutsy century in Cape Town in 2014, completed with a broken shoulder thanks to a bouncer barrage from Morne Morkel, led to Australia's return to No.1, if only temporarily. Later in the year a statesmanlike Clarke led the country in mourning the death of his close friend Phillip Hughes, and an emotional century in Adelaide followed in what Clarke called the most important match of his career.
Although Clarke's ability and dedication could never be questioned, he nevertheless struggled at times to win over sections of the public, due in part to his A-list celebrity status, large endorsements and high-profile private life. There were occasions when he was booed in his own country, and at times he was accused of being too aloof around the team environment. But whatever his off-field status, Clarke will be remembered as a batsman of class and a captain who took the game on, and emerged with an enviable record in both spheres.

Toponymy[ edit ]
There are a number of legends associated with the origin of the name Delhi. One is that it is derived from Dhillu or Dilu, a king who built a city at this location in 50 BC and named it after himself. [13] [14] [15] Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Hindi / Prakrit word dhili (loose) and that it was used by the Tomaras to refer to the city because the Iron Pillar of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved. [15] The coins in circulation in the region under the Tomaras were called dehliwal. [16] According to the Bhavishya Purana , King Prithiviraja of Indraprastha built a new fort in the modern-day Purana Qila area for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom. He ordered the construction of a gateway to the fort and later named the fort dehali. [17] Some historians believe that the name is derived from Dilli, a corruption of dehleez or dehali—both terms meaning 'threshold' or 'gateway'—and symbolic of the city as a gateway to the Gangetic Plain . [18] [19] Another theory suggests that the city's original name was Dhillika. [20]
The people of Delhi are referred to as Delhiites or Dilliwalas. [21] The city is referenced in various idioms of the Northern Indo-Aryan languages . Examples include:
Abhi Dilli door hai or its Persian version, Hanouz Dehli dour ast, literally meaning Delhi is still far away, which is generically said about a task or journey still far from completion. [22] [23]
Dilli dilwalon ka shehr or Dilli Dilwalon ki meaning Delhi belongs to the large-hearted/daring. [24]
Aas-paas barse, Dilli pani tarse, literally meaning it pours all around, while Delhi lies parched. An allusion to the sometimes semi-arid climate of Delhi, it idiomatically refers to situations of deprivation when one is surrounded by plenty. [23]
Main articles: History of Delhi and Old Delhi
The ancient Yogmaya Temple , claimed to be one of the five temples of the Mahabharata era in Delhi.
The area around Delhi was probably inhabited before the second millennium BC, and there is evidence of continuous inhabitation since at least the 6th century BC. [12] The city is believed to be the site of Indraprastha, the legendary capital of the Pandavas in the Indian epic Mahabharata. [13] According to this epic this land was initially a huge mass of forests called 'Khandavaprastha' which was burnt down to build the city of Indraprastha. The earliest architectural relics date back to the Maurya period (c. 300 BC); in 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273–235 BC) was discovered near Srinivaspuri. Remains of eight major cities have been discovered in Delhi. The first five cities were in the southern part of present-day Delhi. Gurjara-pratihara King Anang Pal of the Tomara dynasty founded the city of Lal Kot in AD 736. The Chauhans conquered Lal Kot in 1180 and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora .
The iron pillar of Delhi , is said to have been fashioned at the time of Chandragupta Vikramaditya (375–413) of the Gupta Empire . [25] [26]
The king Prithviraj Chauhan was defeated in 1192 by Muhammad Ghori , a Tajik invader from Afghanistan , who made a concerted effort to conquer northern India. [13] By 1200, native Hindu resistance had begun to crumble, the dominance of foreign Turkic Muslim dynasties in north India was to last for the next five centuries. On the death of Muhammad in 1206, the Turkic slave-general, Qutb-ud-din Aibak , broke away from the Ghurid Dynasty and became the first Sultan of Delhi . He began construction of the Qutb Minar and Quwwat-al-Islam (might of Islam) mosque, the earliest extant mosque in India. Qutb-ud-din faced widespread Hindu rebellions and it was his successor, Iltutmish (1211–36), who consolidated the Turkic conquest of northern India. [13] [27]
At 72.5 m (238 ft), A UNESCO World Heritage Site , the Qutub Minar is the world's tallest free-standing brick minaret . [28]
For the next three hundred years, Delhi was ruled by a succession of Turkic and an Afghan , Lodhi dynasty . They built a number of forts and townships that are part of the seven cities of Delhi . [29] Delhi was a major centre of Sufism during this period. [30] The Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi) was overthrown in 1290 by the Khilji dynasty (1290–1320). Under the second Khilji ruler, Ala-ud-din Khilji , the Delhi sultanate extended its control south of the Narmada River in the Deccan. The Delhi sultanate reached its greatest extent during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughluq (1325–1351). In an attempt to bring the whole of the Deccan under control, he moved his capital to Daulatabad, Maharashtra in central India, but by moving away from Delhi he lost control of the north and was forced to return to Delhi to restore order. The southern provinces then broke away. In the years following the reign of Firoz Shah Tughlaq (1351–1388), the Delhi sultanate rapidly began to lose its hold over its northern provinces. Delhi was captured and sacked by Timur Lenk in 1398. [31] Near Delhi, Timur massacred 100,000 captives. [32] Delhi's decline continued under the Sayyid dynasty (1414–1451), until the sultanate was reduced to Delhi and its hinterland. Under the Afghan Lodhi dynasty (1451–1526), the Delhi sultanate recovered control of the Punjab and the Gangetic plain to once again achieve domination over northern India. However, the recovery was short-lived and in 1526 the sultanate was destroyed by Babur , founder of the Mughal dynasty .
In 1526, Babur , a descendant of Genghis Khan and Timur, from the Fergana Valley in modern-day Uzbekistan , invaded India, defeated the last Lodhi sultan in the First Battle of Panipat and founded the Mughal Empire that ruled from Delhi and Agra . [13] The Mughal dynasty ruled Delhi for more than three centuries, with a sixteen-year hiatus during the reigns of Sher Shah Suri and Hemu from 1540 to 1556. [33] In 1553, the Hindu king, Hemu acceded to the throne of Delhi by defeating forces of Mughal Emperor Humayun at Agra and Delhi. However, the Mughals re-established their rule after Akbar's army defeated Hemu during the Second Battle of Panipat in 1556. [34] [35] [36] Shah Jahan built the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name Shahjahanabad , which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1638 and is today known as the Old City or Old Delhi. [37]
A UNESCO World Heritage Site , Red fort is the location from which the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on Independence Day
After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire's influence declined rapidly as the Hindu Maratha Empire from Deccan Plateau rose to prominence. [38] In 1737, Maratha forces sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi . In 1739, the Mughal Empire lost the huge Battle of Karnal in less than three hours against the numerically outnumbered but militarily superior Persian army led by Nader Shah of Persia during his invasion after which he completely sacked and looted Delhi , the Mughal capital, carrying away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne , the Daria-i-Noor , and Koh-i-Noor . The Mughals, severely further weakened, could never overcome this crushing defeat and humiliatiin danger of conceding a massive first-innings lead after losing their top five for 281. Dhoni disregards the match situation, matched fire with fire, and what follows is a breathless knock that kills any chances of a result in the Test. A fired-up Shoaib Akhtar steams in and peppers Dhoni with a barrage of short balls, but Dhoni responds with a thrilling counterattack, hooking and pulling with aggression that almost approaches recklessness. He hits four sixes and 19 fours in his innings for 148, which take him only 153 balls. By the time he is out, India trail by only 97 runs.

76 v England at Lord's, 2007
This is perhaps Dhoni's most valuable innings, for it helps India avoid impending defeat and provides the turnaround for a historic series victory in England. He has played an atrocious shot to get out for a duck in the first innings, and is the last of India's recognised batsmen, when at 145 for 5 India need to bat for more than two sessions to save the Test. He adds 86 for the sixth wicket with VVS Laxman who gets out with India on 231 for 6. Dhoni rides his luck, survives several edges and bats for 159 balls for his 76. He keeps losing partners, but manages to hang on with Sreesanth, the No 11, until the rain, which has threatened to arrive all day, finally does and ends the Test.

Ganguly revels in adversity
Sourav Ganguly's game sort of clicks when he has been written off, it sort of clicks when people want him to be seen as the enemy

The serial offender has done it again. Sourav Ganguly's announcement that this series would be his last took most of the adverse attention off his middle-order friends and concentrated it upon him. He revealed it was the Irani Cup axe that prompted his decision to quit and then drew flak for uncharitable comments, which were attributed to him, about selectors and team-mates. Suddenly, barely days after his decision to "gracefully retire" was celebrated, he once again became the villain. How we love to do that to Ganguly.
The pressure facing Ganguly this time, however, was new. He has battled for his place in side on several occasions but this time his selection was beyond doubt. And that created pressure in itself because he wouldn't want to be picked only because he had announced his retirement. That too after he had been made to feel unwanted, in no unsubtle terms, by not being called for the pre-series camp in Bangalore. The camp was held before the selection for the Tests, and apart from Ganguly (and Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik, who were both sure to be dropped), all the members of the previous Ts with mind-boggling figures of 6 for 9 with his left-arm spin on a rank turner in Mumbai . It's still not enough to hand Australia victory in a game that lasted little more than 200 overs.

Profile
Rudi Koerzten is a modern umpire in the traditional mould, with an image that is a curious blend of old and new - his flat white cap is offset by a pair of wraparound shades that rarely leave his face except in the poorest of conditions, while his trademark is a dalek-like, super slow (and getting slower) raise of the fatal finger to exterminate a batsman's innings.
A lifelong fan of the game, Koerzten played league cricket while working as a clerk on the South African railways, but soon turned his hand to umpiring in 1981. He first stood in a Test at the age of 43, at Port Elizabeth in 1992-93, the first series in which TV replays were used to judge run-out decisions. Appointed as a full-time ICC umpire in 1997 - and a member of the elite panel in 2002 - he leaves little to chance by putting in regular sessions in the gym, as well as long hours in front of the TV studying the techniques - and previous dismissals - of the batsmen at his mercy.
In September 1999, he was praised for his swift refusal of a bribe prior to the Coca-Cola Cup final between West Indies and India in Singapore, and four months later he was once again at the sharp end of the match-fixing crisis, when he stood in the now-infamous Centurion Test between South Africa and England.  In April 2007 he stood in the World Cup final in Barbados, but the farcical finale of that match - and his role in misinterpreting the rules regarding bad light - led to his suspension for the Twenty20 World Championships in September.
Koerzten is not immune to the pressures of the job, and in 2000-01 his errors contributed to one of the most fractious matches of modern times, the second Test between Sri Lanka and England at Kandy. Nevertheless, he retains the respect of the players, and an enthusiasm that enables him to spend more than 240 days of the year away from his wife and four children. In 2007 he broke David Shepherd's record of standing in 172 ODIs.

Tendulkar scales the highest peak
A statistical analysis of Sachin Tendulkar's Test career

Another run record for Sachin Tendulkar

Thirty-nine centuries, 12,027 runs, 152 Tests - the numbers are immense whichever way you look at it. In a career spanning nearly 20 years, Sachin Tendulkar has constantly been India's biggest hope: through the 1990s, he was easily India's best batsman, especially overseas , in conditions none of the others came close to mastering. With the emergence of Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag and Sourav Ganguly, the pressure has eased somewhat, but Tendulkar still remains the most prized wicket for opposition bowlers, which is a remarkable testimony to his skill levels and the high standards he has consistently achieved.
The best measure of the class of a batsman is his performances against the greatest team of his time, and if that is the yardstick then Tendulkar is matchless: in 50 innings against Australia, he averages 55.60, with nine hundreds and an equal number of fifties. Since 1990, he is one of only four batsmen who have scored more than 1000 runs against Australia at a 50-plus average. ( Click here for the full list.)
Through most of his career, Tendulkar has been the mainstay of the Indian batting, which is reflected in the percentage of team runs that he has scored. As you'd expect, it isn't as high as Lara's, who has often been West Indies' only hope, but it's only a few decimal points below Dravid's, and a run lesser than Gavaskar's, who was also helped by the fact that he opened the batting and hence had a greater opportunity to bat. The three Australians are at the bottom of the list, which clearly indicates the quality of the other batsmen they played with.

The champion at No. 4
Tendulkar started his Test journey at No.6, but 22 innings into his career, in the second innings in Adelaide in 1991-92, he was pushed up to No. 4 for the first time as India chased a daunting target of 372. The move failed - Tendulkar made just 17 - but in his next innings, on a bouncy Perth track, he scored 114 sublime runs which virtually sealed his No. 4 slot. Since then he has batted almost exclusively at that position, scoring 10041 runs at No. 4 - the most by any batsman at any position, and nearly 84% of his total runs. Tendulkar averages 56.09 at No. 4 - among batsmen with at least 4000 runs , only three have a higher average at No.4. ( Click here for Tendulkar's innings-by-innings list at No. 4.)
The presence of Dravid at No. 3 has bolstered the top order immensely, but the lack of a settled and successful opening pair has meant Tendulkar has often come out to bat early in the innings, when the bowlers are fresh and encouraged by two quick strikes. Out of the 201 times he has batted at No. 4, 78 times he has come out with the score less than 50, of which on 34 occasions the score was less than 20. The table below lists his performances according to the team situation at his entry. When he has come in very early, his numbers have suffered - the average dips to less than 40. However, these situations have also produced some of his really memorable innings: against Pakistan in Chennai in 1999, he made 136 as India fell agonisingly short of a fourth-innings target of 271 after their second wicket had fallen at 6; in the Boxing Day Test in 2000, he scored 116 glorious runs coming in at 11 for 2; at Edgbaston in 1996, he came in at 17 for 2 and scored 122 out of a team score of 219, in an innings in which the second-highest score was a mere 18.
However, there were also other instances when he fell cheaply - 18 times out of these 34 innings he was dismissed under 20.
He was far more successful when he came in with the score between 21 and 50, averaging 54.56. Among his 44 innings in such situations, his two most unforgettable ones were in Bloemfontein, when he came in at 43 for 2 and made a stunning 155 , and at Trent Bridge in 1996, when he scored 177 after the team had been 33 for 2.
Most of his No. 4 runs, though, have come when the top three have given India a solid start: coming in at a score of 100 or more, he averages more than 76, with 17 centuries in 71 innings, including three of his four double-hundreds. Forty-one of those innings have been at home, where he averages almost 70. In similar situations overseas, his average is an incredible 87.39, with five unbeaten hundreds.

Zaheer fined 80% of match fee for send-off

The India fast bowler Zaheer Khan was fined 80% of his match fee on Tuesday for unsporting conduct during India's dominant victory. Zaheer took three wickets in four balls on the final morning to secure India's 320-run win before attending a hearing with the ICC match referee Chris Broad.
Zaheer pleaded guilty to a Level 2 offence for conduct contrary to the spirit of the game after the dismissal of Matthew Hayden in Australia's second innings on Monday. He was fielding when Hayden was dismissed lbw to Harbhajan Singh and "circled the batsman and shouted at him in an aggressive manner".
"Clearly, this sort of behaviour is not acceptable at any level of cricket - it showed a lack of respect for the player who had been dismissed," Broad said. "Respect for the opposition was something that we talked about in the pre-series meeting I had with both captains and so it was disappointing that Zaheer behaved in this way."
Broad considered Zaheer's good disciplinary record in delivering the fine. "He also pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and was very apologetic while also promising not to repeat the offence," Broad said.
Hayden complained to umpire Rudi Koertzen, who was standing at square leg, when he left the ground in the over before tea on the fourth day. Hayden's dismissal sparked a collapse, with Australia losing five wickets for nine runs to slump to 58-5 while chasing an unlikely victory target of 516.
Koertzen and Asad Rauf intervened on a number of occasions during the match to call for calm. India's captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not feel there was a problem with the behaviour of some of his players - Harbhajan Singh was particularly animated on occasions - during the Test.
"The match referee decides that," Dhoni said. "If there is some aggressive cricket in the field going on, I prefer that. The guys are not really crossing the boundary, so it is okay."
Ponting said he did not mind "chitchat" on the field, but "if players do overstep the line then the umpires get involved". "They did get est squad were present.
The retirement and its aftermath ensured that Ganguly would still be fighting personal battles during the series. Another charge he's had to face was that he was a distraction to the team. Not to worry, though, for the dramatic build-up only took the game to Ganguly's home turf. It's hard to explain why, but as Ian Botham said of his own technique, it sort of clicks. Ganguly's game sort of clicks when he has been written off, it sort of clicks when people want him to be seen as the enemy. His game has sort of clicked so far in this series, for one last time.
Not many have scored a century in a series which they have chosen to be their last, a feat which Greg Chappell, an admirer of Ganguly's mental toughness, has performed. And when he completed his hundred, his celebrations portrayed a man at peace with himself. In his mind, perhaps, he didn't need to respond to chin-music claims, a coach, or even a former chairman of selectors. It has been a distinct characteristic of the Ganguly who made a comeback to the side in South Africa. Some have even called it his "paternal avatar".
So when Ganguly flicked Cameron White towards the midwicket boundary in the third over after lunch, and realised the ball wouldn't be cut off by the fielders, he ran towards the end opposite the pavilion, pumped his fists and raised both his arms, while smiling to himself. The helmet stayed where it was, and he didn't point at anybody. By the time Mahendra Singh Dhoni went up to hug him, Ganguly had already had a private moment or two. Here was a man who had fought the world, and more, but during one of his final moments of glory, he didn't have a message for his detractors, as if they didn't matter.
The century itself was a subdued effort on a flat pitch: more determined than flamboyant, more workman like than princely. He said later that the Australians had blocked the boundaries by employing defensive fields almost throughout. This innings required more patience than usual and Ganguly had it in abundance. Yesterday he took 18 balls to get off the mark but raced away while everybody was focused on Sachin Tendulkar's record. By the time Tendulkar took charge, Ganguly had reached his thirties and took the back seat again.
Today he had to start anew, almost like an opener, against refreshed bowlers and a ball which was five-overs old. He also had to make sure India didn't collapse before reaching a formidable total. He had the perfect partner in Dhoni, who took the attack to Australia, and the spotlight away from Ganguly. Quietly he moved towards his second hundred against Australia and his first at home. Perhaps it had taken a lot of out him for the error that resulted in his dismissal came immediately after he had reached the century. Ganguly's innings had begun with India on 163 for 4 but his partnerships with Tendulkar and Dhoni had helped achieve a total of 469.
On October 7, he had said "just one last thing lads", and dropped a bomb. On October 18, he said that one last thing. Or maybe not for there are five possible innings to go. We are still listening, Dadi.

Coach complicates Ponting-Lee clash
Ricky Ponting did not entrust the ball to Brett Lee on the fourth morning in Mohali
© Getty Images
 
The on-field dispute between Brett Lee and Ricky Ponting has taken a twist with the coach Tim Nielsen saying a poor over-rate was not the main reason the strike bowler was not used in the first session of the fourth day in Mohali. Lee, who has failed to penetrate in his first two Tests in India, argued with Ponting on a morning when the part-time medium pacer Michael Hussey, the debutant Peter Siddle, regular Mitchell Johnson and spinner Cameron White were all preferred to him.
Ponting and Michael Clarke, the captain and vice-captain, both justified the decision by saying the team was about five overs behind the required rate - they also wanted to slow the speed of the ball down - but Nielsen said they were only three behind. It's not a level that would cause any player to fear a fine.
"We made a decision to take pace off the ball," Nielsen said. "You don't see Hussey bowl too often. We changed things around because things weren't working for us. The over-rate wasn't crazily out of control: three down at the time. In the end it was a tactical decision."
The team believes the incident, which featured heavily in Australian papers, was blown out of proportion and Ponting and Nielsen said there was no lingering resentment between the players. However, Nielsen's explanation shows how worried Ponting was over the form of his main bowler, who he did not want to risk when India resumed their target setting at 100 for 1.
"When you're losing Tests, there's a lot of things being made of little issues," Nielsen said. "When you're winning, that's not the case."
Lee delivered eight overs after lunch on the fourth day and took the wicket of Sourav Ganguly before India's declaration. Siddle bowled admirably in his first Test, collecting four wickets, but Lee almost has 300 victims.
"He certainly hasn't got the results he's been looking for," Nielsen said. "He's been indicative of the performances over the two test Tests, he's been a little inconsistent."
Nielsen said Lee was "frustrated" but was fine mentally after a difficult off-season, which included separating from his wife. "He's come from a 15-month period where he's had real impact every time he's been required," he said." In some regards, we've built this series up, it's got a bigger status than normal.
"Brett was keen to have a real impact and when that happens it is easy to get impatient and search for results. He's working hard, he's come off a break from his personal issues and has had a break from not playing in Darwin. All those things have added up to him being a little bit off the boil."
Nielsen felt the bowlers were too impatient in Mohali, where India's batsmen worked the side into a position to set Australia 516 for victory. "We were searching for results quickly because we felt like we were under pressure," he said. "These conditions are unrelenting, if you're not quite right with your skills you get shown out."

When the squad reconvenes in Delhi on Sunday the bowlers will continue their quest to discover the secrets of reverse-swing. They were behind when England used it spectacularly in 2005 and are desperate to catch up following the highly effective tricks of Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma over the past two weeks.
"We've tried a few different things, like bowling across seam," Nielsen said. "We're working on getting one side rougher, and doing it legally, which is the challenge." Troy Cooley, the bowling coach in charge of England three years ago, should be able to help and has told the bowlers to hold the ball across the seam, like the Indians do.
"We haven't been able to put the ball in the right place often enough, when it's been swinging or not," Nielsen said. "Sharma and Khan build up big pressure and it's difficult to score. There's more pressure on batsmen for longer periods."
Stuart Clark's fitness will be tested early next week after he missed the second Test with an elbow injury. He had a cortisone injection before the second match and will be expected to bowl regularly before proving he is ready to return. If he can, he will get his spot back.
"Stuart has played so well for us over the past couple of years," Nielsen said. "Given his elbow comes right, you'd expect him to come back into the team."

In 1757, the Afghan ruler, Ahmad Shah Durrani , sacked Delhi. He returned to Afghanistan leaving a Mughal puppet ruler in nominal control. The Marathas again occupied Delhi in 1758, and were in control until their defeat in 1761 at the third battle of Panipat when the city was captured again by Ahmad Shah. [45] However, in 1771, the Marathas established a protectorate over Delhi when the Maratha ruler, Mahadji Shinde , recaptured Delhi and the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II was installed as a puppet ruler in 1772. [46] In 1783, Sikhs under Baghel Singh captured Delhi and Red Fort but due to the treaty signed, Sikhs withdrew from Red Fort and agreed to restore Shah Alam as the emperor.In 1803, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War , the forces of British East India Company defeated the Maratha forces in the Battle of Delhi . [47] During the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , Delhi fell to the forces of East India Company after a bloody fight known as the Siege of Delhi . The city came under the direct control of the British Government in 1858. It was made a district province of the Punjab . [13] In 1911, it was announced that the capital of British held territories in India was to be transferred from Calcutta to Delhi. [48] The name "New Delhi" was given in 1927, and the new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931. New Delhi, also known as Lutyens' Delhi, [49] was officially declared as the capital of the Union of India after the country gained independence on 15 August 1947. [50] During the partition of India , thousands of Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from West Punjab fled to Delhi, while many Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan. Migration to Delhi from the rest of India continues (as of 2013), contributing more to the rise of Delhi's population than the birth rate, which is declining. [51]
The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi. [52] The Act gave Delhi its own legislative assembly along Civil lines, though with limited powers. [52] In December 2001, the Parliament of India building in New Delhi was attacked by armed militants, killing six security personnel. [53] India suspected Pakistan-based militant groups were behind the attack, which caused a major diplomatic crisis between the two countries. [54] There were further terrorist attacks in Delhi in October 2005 and September 2008 , resulting in a total of 103 deaths. [55]
Main article: Environment of Delhi
Delhi is located at 28°37′N 77°14′E﻿ / ﻿28.61°N 77.23°E﻿ / 28.61; 77.23 , and lies in Northern India . It borders the Indian states of Haryana on the north, west and south and Uttar Pradesh (UP) to the east. Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge . The Yamuna river was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, north-east and north-west parts of the city. It reaches a height of 318 m (1,043 ft) and is a dominant feature of the region. [56]
The National Capital Territory of Delhi covers an area of 1,484 km2 (573 sq mi), of which 783 km2 (302 sq mi) is designated rural, and 700 km2 (270 sq mi) urban therefore making it the largest city in terms of area in the country. It has a length of 51.9 km (32 mi) and a width of 48.48 km (30 mi).
Delhi is included in India's seismic zone-IV , indicating its vulnerability to major earthquakes, but earthquakes have not been common in recent history. [57]

Delhi features an atypical version of the humid subtropical climate ( Köppen Cwa). The warm season lasts from 9 April to 8 July with an average daily high temperature above 36 °C (97 °F). The hottest day of the year is 22 May, with an average high of 38 °C (100 °F) and low of 25 °C (77 °F). [58] The cold season lasts from 11 December to 11 February with an average daily high temperature below 18 °C (64 °F). The coldest day of the year is 4 January, with an average low of 2 °C (36 °F) and high of 15 °C (59 °F). [58] In early March, the wind direction changes from north-westerly to south-westerly. From April to October the weather is hot. The monsoon arrives at the end of June, along with an increase in humidity. [59] The brief, mild winter starts in late November, peaks in January and heavy fog often occurs. [60]
Temperatures in Delhi usually range from 5 to 40 °C (41.0 to 104.0 °F), with the lowest and highest temperatures ever recorded being −6.7 and 47.8 °C (19.9 and 118.0 °F) respectively. [61] The annual mean temperature is 25 °C (77 °F); monthly mean temperatures range from 13 to 32 °C (55 to 90 °F). The highest temperature recorded in July was 45 °C (113 °F) in 1931. [62] [63] The average annual rainfall is approximately 714 mm (28.1 in), most of which falls during the monsoon in July and August. [13] The average date of the advent of monsoon winds in Delhi is 29 June. [64]

Location[ edit ]
The Basin Reserve is two kilometres south of the Wellington CBD at the foot of Mount Victoria . Government House and the Wellington College boys' school are to the south of the Basin, across the street. At the eastern end of the basin is the Mount Victoria Tunnel , which increased the traffic flow around the Basin Reserve when it was built in 1931.
The New Zealand Cricket Museum is located in the Old Grandstand. It houses cricket memorabilia and a reference library.
The Basin Reserve is also surrounded by numerous other Wellington landmarks, including Mount Cook Barracks, the National War Memorial , several colleges and high schools, the Caledonian Hotel and the former Dominion Museum . The Basin Reserve is the intersection point for the Wellington suburbs of Mount Cook , Newtown and Mount Victoria . [2]
Construction history[ edit ]
The area that is now Basin Reserve was originally a lake (known as the Basin Lake), and there were plans to connect it to the sea by a canal to make it an alternative inner city harbour, with major warehouses and factories alongside it. However, the massive 1855 Wairarapa earthquake uplifted the area nearly 1.8 m and turned the lake into a swamp . [3] Due to the colonists' English roots, sport, particularly cricket, was a vital part of the community's way to relax. However, no land had been allocated by the city planners for recreational reserves. Although natural grounds, such as the Te Aro flat, provided a small area for matches, the colonists wanted more recreational land than what they had. The matter became more dire as buildings began to be erected on these flat plains, as flat land was hard to find in the mountainous Wellington. So after the 1855 earthquake, which historians estimate measured 8 on the Richter scale , [4] influential citizens seized the chance in 1857 to suggest that the new land be drained and made into a recreational reserve. The Wellington council accepted the proposal and beginning on 3 February 1863 prisoners from the Mount Cook Gaol began to level and drain the new land. The swamp was drained by September and a fence was placed around the entire area along with hedges.

Anil Kumble,  India's Test captain, is confident of returning for the third Test against Australia in Delhi after sitting out the second game in Mohali due to a shoulder injury. Kumble said it was unfortunate he could not be part of the combination which achieved India's biggest Test win in terms of runs - 320 - and that he was looking forward to returning to the Feroz Shah Kotla where he has taken 55 wickets in six games.
"It was very heartening to see MS [Dhoni] lead from the front and it was fantastic to watch the way the team approached the game and the intensity we kept up throughout," Kumble wrote in his syndicated newspaper column. "And while I unfortunately had to sit this one out, I'm raring to get going at the Kotla, my favourite Test centre."
Kumble had a forgettable outing in the first match in Bangalore, going wicketless for only the third time in his Test career. He reacted strongly to media criticism about his captaincy, form, and fitness, and insisted he would return once fully fit.
Kris Srikkanth, the new chairman of selectors, agreed that Kumble had a good chance of returning for the Test, starting on October 29. "I'm very confident he will play," Srikkanth told ABC Radio. "One of the reasons he probably didn't play this (Mohali) match was so that he gets proper rest for the next two Tests."
Kumble's return, however, could come at the expense of the legspinner Amit Mishra, who took seven wickets on debut. Kumble was very impressed with Mishra's use of flight and variations.
"With an eye to the future, it also augurs well for India that we've found someone like Amit," Kumble wrote. "An orthodox bowler, he spins the ball a lot, uses his flight very nicely and frankly, it was great watching him. The first five-for I got told me that if I could get one, I could get more. Confidence is critical. As Amit's five-for has come in his first game itself against Australia, it's even better for him."
He said Mishra was finally being rewarded after going through the grind in eight domestic seasons. "He bowled beautifully and not just by the debutant yardstick. All the hard yards he's done as a domestic cricketer served him well here. It's incredibly tough work, the domestic circuit and Amit serves as a perfect example of what perseverance can do."

Don't panic: Australia were surprised by their heavy defeat in Mohali but Tim Nielsen wants Ricky Ponting and his men to stay focused

The Australia coach Tim Nielsen has told his team not to panic after the shock defeat in the second Test in Mohali. Nielsen's outfit has not beaten India in the past four encounters and the 320-run loss was the country's seventh-heaviest in history, but he is confident of a turnaround for the third game in Delhi from next Wednesday.
However, he sent the players off for three days of rest with a clear message. "One thing we just have to be so certain about is that we don't panic," he said. "We have to understand what the right way to go about playing over here is, and keep ourselves controlled and calm enough that we can deliver under the pressure we find ourselves."
Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma have troubled Australia's batsmen regularly throughout the opening two matches and the spinners also caused a lot of problems in Mohali. The major issue for Australia is that no part of their game is firing and the bowlers, particularly Brett Lee, are struggling for impact against the home batsminvolved a couple of times in this game," he said. "We all know the referee is involved in the Zaheer Khan incident from yesterday [Monday]."
India, who lost 2-1 to Australia in a fractious series in 2007-08, were aggressive throughout the match, playing in the style of their opponents.
Dhoni downplayed the impact the attitude had in contributing to the success, which gave India a 1-0 lead in the four-match series.
"The main way to beat Australia is to play good, consistent cricket," he said. "If it [the way to beat them] was by using verbals we would have hired some guys who are good at that stuff. Ultimately you've got to play good cricket. A bit of verbal chitchat going around is fine, it gives some excitement to the game, but it's got to be between the boundaries."

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 1st day October 17, 2008
Tendulkar and Ganguly give India the edge
Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly added 142 for the fifth wicket

India's batsmen sandwiched a middle-order wobble in the afternoon with excellent batting during the first and third sessions to inch ahead of Australia on the first day in Mohali. A brief passage of play, during which India lost three wickets for 17 runs, threatened to undo the 104-run platform built in the morning but Sachin Tendulkar, who became Test cricket's highest run-scorer, and Sourav Ganguly ensured that the initiative wasn't lost by batting the majority of the final session.
Unlike the pitch in Bangalore, which had variable bounce from the start, the surface at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium was true. There was hardly any swing or movement off the pitch; the ball came on to the bat, and sped off it, allowing the batsmen to drive on the up or hit through the line. Australia's bowlers, who failed to bowl disciplined lines during the first session, were more accurate - and successful - after lunch. At tea, given the outstanding batting conditions, Australia held the edge having reduced India to 174 for 4. Another wicket would have made it their day but they were blunted by Tendulkar and Ganguly, who scored at nearly four an over without any risks.
Tendulkar broke Brian Lara's record off the first ball after tea, steering Peter Siddle to third man, but, once the seemingly endless fireworks subsided, India needed a much more substantial contribution from him. It was Ganguly, however, who set the pace initially. He had taken 17 balls to get off the mark before tea but after the interval he hit the ball through gaps in the offside with precision, driving Shane Watson and Peter Siddle for three boundaries between point and cover. He milked that region for 41 of his runs and, apart from a stumping against Cameron White - Rudi Koertzen did not refer it to the third umpire - and a couple of uncertain wafts against the second new ball, his innings was calm.
Towards the end of the day, Tendulkar was batting so confidently that he despatched the first delivery with the second new ball, bowled by Siddle, through cover with a back foot drive. He tried to repeat the shot the next ball but inside edged the ball past his stumps. His third attempt to push the new ball through the offside 15 minutes before stumps landed in Matthew Hayden's hands at first slip and gave Siddle his maiden Test wicket. It ended a 142-run stand and helped even the balance between the teams.
Before that error in judgement, however, Tendulkar had scored runs all round the ground and wasn't tied down by any bowler. He was severe on Siddle, against whom he scored 29 off 20 balls, driving him twice past mid-on for four and steering him to the third-man boundary. He also scored at a strike-rate of above 75 against Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson, who was once again Australia's best bowler. When Ponting brought on Cameron White, Tendulkar attempted to unsettle the legspinner by charging down the pitch and lofting down the ground. He brought up his fifty - his 50th in Test cricket - and also became the first batsmen to score 12,000 Test runs.
Smart stats
The 15th run of his 88 helped Sachin Tendulkar break Brian Lara's record for most Test runs . Tendulkar also became the first to reach 12,000 Test runs during his innings.
The innings also saw Tendulkar complete 10,000 runs at No. 4, making him the first to score more than 10,000 at a single position. He now has 10,041 runs at No. 4 ; the next-best is Lara with 7535.
Tendulkar scored his 50th Test fifty. He is the fourth batsman to achieve the feat, and the second Indian; Rahul Dravid was the first.
Ganguly became the 33rd player and the fourth Indian to score 7000 runs in Tests.
During their 142-run stand, Ganguly and Tendulkar became the sixth pair to score more than 4000 runs when batting together in Tests. Rahul Dravid and Tendulkar have combined for over 5000 runs.
India scored 49% of their runs in boundaries; 58% of their runs came in fours until the end of the second session.
Eighteen bowlers, including Cameron White and Peter Siddle in this series, have claimed Tendulkar's wicket in their first Test.
Those records were preceded by a spell in which Australia regained ground lost during the morning session; though their bowlers rectified mistakes made earlier in the day, the wickets were primarily due to lapses by the batsmen.
Johnson was largely responsible for the fightback. He ended Virender Sehwag's charge in the morning, caught down the leg side, and dismissed Laxman in a similar manner after lunch. In between those wickets he contained Dravid by bowling full and wide with seven fielders on the off side, and induced an edge from Gambhir as he tried to drive another full delivery through cover. Australia picked up 3 for 17 and recovered from the rapid start made by Gambhir and Sehwag.
Gambhir was struck on the helmet by Siddle's first ball in international cricket but recovered to drive the ball through cover, a stroke that would become a feature of his innings. Sehwag ensured the run-rate stayed around six an over by piercing the infield frequently. He punished Siddle when the line was too straight, nudging him down to fine leg, and flicking to the square-leg boundary twice in succession.
The batsmen hit 10 boundaries in the first hour and raced to 63 in 13 overs. Having tried all his fast bowlers, Ricky Ponting gave the final over of the session to the left-arm spinner Michael Clarke. Gambhir took the opportunity to reach his half-century before lunch by stepping out to loft Clarke twice in a row over mid-on.
The Australians came out after the break with different lines of attack. Watson and Siddle restricted Gambhir's scoring by aiming short balls at his ribs. Johnson slanted deliveries full and wide outside off stump and asked the batsmen to drive with seven fielders on the off side. Dravid chased one and was beaten, after which he let several go. He eventually played on while trying to force Lee through the off side.
India had two new batsmen at the crease a short while before tea and had to begin from scratch. Tendulkar and Ganguly protected the innings from further damage.

A player of passion, with talent to match, Harbhajan Singh is India's most successful offspin bowler. Purists might mutter about a lack of loop and flight, but he is very much a product of his times where short boundaries, heavy bats and shorter forms afford little latitude to slow bowlers. Bowling with a windmilling, whiplash action, remodelled after he was reported for throwing, he deals by varying his length and his pace, and can turn it the other way too. His deadliest ball, however, is the one that climbs wickedly from a length, forcing a hurried jab. In March 2001, it proved too much for the all-conquering Australians, as Harbhajan collected 32 wickets in three Tests, including the first Test hat-trick by an Indian, while none of his team-mates managed more than three.
His personal rivalry against the Australians has provided him both the highest and the lowest points of his career.

West Bengal's climate varies from tropical savanna in the southern portions to humid subtropical in the north. The main seasons are summer, rainy season, a short autumn, and winter. While the summer in the delta region is noted for excessive humidity, the western highlands experience a dry summer like northern India, with the highest day temperature ranging from 38 °C (100 °F) to 45 °C (113 °F). [53] At nights, a cool southerly breeze carries moisture from the Bay of Bengal. In early summer brief squalls and thunderstorms known as Kalbaisakhi, or Nor'westers, often occur. [54] West Bengal receives the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian ocean monsoon that moves in a northwest direction. Monsoons bring rain to the whole state from June to September. Heavy rainfall of above 250 cm is observed in the Darjeeling , Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar district . During the arrival of the monsoons, low pressure in the Bay of Bengal region often leads to the occurrence of storms in the coastal areas . Winter (December–January) is mild over the plains with average minimum temperatures of 15 °C (59 °F). [53] A cold and dry northern wind blows in the winter, substantially lowering the humidity level. The Darjeeling Himalayan Hill region experiences a harsh winter, with occasional snowfall at places.

Format[ edit ]
From its inception until the 2001–02 season, the teams were grouped geographically into four or five zones – North, West, East, and South, with Central added in 1952–53. Initial matches were played within the zones on a knock-out basis until 1956–57, and thereafter on a league basis, to determine a winner; then, the five individual zone winners competed in a knock-out tournament, leading to a final which decided the winner of the Ranji Trophy. From the 1970–71 season, the knock-out stage was expanded to the top two teams from each zone, a total of ten qualifying teams. This was expanded again to the top three from each zone in 1992–93, a total of fifteen qualifying teams; between 1996–97 and 1999–2000, the fifteen qualifying teams competed in a secondary group stage, with three groups of five teams, and the top two from each group qualified for a six-team knock-out stage; in all other years until 2001–02, a full fifteen-team knock-out tournament was held.
The format was changed in the 2002–03 season with the zonal system abandoned and a two-division structure adopted – the Elite Group, containing fifteen teams, and the Plate Group, containing the rest. Each group had two sub-groups which played a round-robin; the top two from each Elite sub-group then contested a four-team knock-out tournament to determine the winner of the Ranji Trophy. The team which finished last in each Elite sub-group was relegated, and both Plate Group finalists were promoted for the following season. For the 2006–07 season , the divisions were re-labelled the Super League and Plate League respectively.
In the 2008–09 season, this format was adjusted to give both Super League and Plate League teams an opportunity to contest the Ranji Trophy. The top two from each Plate sub-group contested semi-finals; the winners of these two matches then joined the top three from each Super League sub-group in an eight-team knock-out tournament. The winner of this knock-out tournament then won the Ranji Trophy. Promotion and relegation between Super League and Plate League continued as before. In the 2010–11 season, Rajasthan won the Ranji Trophy after beginning the season in the Plate League.
From the 2012–13 season, this format was adjusted slightly. The Super League and Plate League names were abandoned, but the two-tier system remained. The top tier expanded from fifteen teams to eighteen teams, in two sub-groups of nine (known as Group A and Group B, and considered equal in status); and the second tier was reduced to nine teams in a single group (known as Group C). The top three teams from Groups A and B and the top two from Group C contest the knockout phase. The lowest placed team in each of Group A and Group B is relegated to Group C, and the top two from Group C are promoted to the top tier.
Round-robin matches are four days in length; knockout matches are played for five days. Throughout its history, if there is no outright result in a Ranji Trophy knock-out match, the team leading after the first innings is the winner.
Points in the league stages of both divisions are currently awarded as follows:

Domestic career[ edit ]
Kaul made his debut for the Punjab cricket team against Orissa in the 2007-08 Ranji Trophy , alongside his brother who was wicket-keeper for the match. He took a five wicket haul in the first innings , and finished with figures of 5/97. [1] He has also made appearances for the Punjab youth teams, at Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 levels. [2]
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
For the Indian Premier League's inaugural season, a number of members of the victorious India Under-19s team from the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup and other specified youngsters were named as players to be drafted by teams in the Indian Premier League, whilst other youth players would have to be chosen to play for their local teams. [3] Kaul was chosen by the Kolkata Knight Riders , based in Kolkata , West Bengal , and captained by Sourav Ganguly . [4]
Youth international career[ edit ]
Kaul was named in the squad for the India U-19s team for the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia . He played in all of India's matches as they proceeded to the final, where they defeated the South African U-19 cricket team by 12 runs (adjusted by the DL method ). [5] He took 10 wickets at an average of 15.40, putting him joint tenth on the list of highest wicket-takers for the tournament. [6]

In the sport of cricket , a bowling analysis (sometimes shortened to just analysis, especially in the phrase innings analysis, and also referred to as bowling figures) usually refers to a notation summarising a bowler 's performance in terms of overs bowled, how many of those overs are maidens (i.e. with no runs conceded), total runs conceded and number of wickets taken. [1] Bowling analyses are generally given for each innings in cricket scoreboards printed in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack , newspapers and so on, but they are also sometimes quoted for other periods of time, such as a single spell of bowling. Typically, the analysis is given in the following format: Overs – Maidens – Runs conceded – Wickets.
In some cases, overs and maidens are omitted from bowling figures, and are recorded showing 'Wickets/Runs'; for example, 7/15 by Glenn McGrath against Namibia shows he took his 7 wickets for 15 runs. [2]
In Test cricket , the best bowling analysis for a single innings is 10/53 by Jim Laker . [3] The best bowling analysis in an ODI is 8/19 by Chaminda Vaas . [4] The best bowling analysis in a Twenty20 International is 6/8 by Ajantha Mendis . [5]



ated in Wellington) hampered construction on the Basin Reserve as workers were pulled to other areas.
After a council meeting on 11 December 1866 the Basin Reserve became Wellington's official cricket ground. No cattle or horses were allowed in the ground and only small hedges and shrubs were allowed to be planted so as not to hamper cricket games. Soon after, on 11 January 1868, the first game of cricket was played, although the ground had numerous stones and thistles on it, which the umpire later apologised for as some players got injured from them. Although it was the opening day, no ceremony or music was played, nor was the opening advertised with banners.
Soon after that first event, the Highland Games began being held at the Basin Reserve. The games were organised by the Wellingtonian Caledonian Society, of which their headquarters, The Caledonian Hotel, still stands towards the south of the Basin Reserve. The society offered up prize money which brought many competitors to the region. Due to their success, the society petitioned to have new grandstands built at the western end of the Basin Reserve. They would measure 44 ft by 20 ft and would cost approximately £250–£300. The stands would also hold food stalls and ground keepers. However, for the following years, even up until reportedly 1872, the Basin Reserve grounds were still extremely swampy, with small pools of swamp water and various weeds and shrubs sprouting over the fields. In late 1872, horses were used to level the playing field and this greatly improved the conditions.
Spectators and the William Wakefield Memorial
In 1882, the William Wakefield Memorial was erected at the Basin Reserve. The monument had been in storage for many years, and it was finally erected to commemorate one of the city's founders, William Wakefield , at the main sports ground. [5] [6]
The pavilion has been a Category II registered Historic Place since 1982, [7] and the entire Basin Reserve has been a registered Historic Area since 1998. [8] The William Wakefield Memorial has a Category I registration. [6]
Crowd in a Test match Between England and New Zealand in Basin Reserve in 2008
The first ever event played on the Basin Reserve was a game of one-day cricket on 11 January 1868 between the Mount Cook Gaol prisoners and their officers and the crew of the HMS Falcon, which was docked in Wellington. However, the game was hampered with injuries from numerous stones and thistles in the grass, which led to the injury of some players. The umpire apologised after the game to the players for the poor conditions of play.
After that first event, local societies began organising athletic and sport meetings at the Basin Reserve. These meetings were eventually called the Highland Games and it was their success which led to the construction of the ground's grand stand. The events included athletics, racing, dancing and later wood-chopping and cycling. However, the ground was still swampy in some areas, but was remedied in late 1872. This allowed the first first-class game, Wellington against Auckland , to be played on 30 November 1873, which Wellington won easily. Another first at the Basin Reserve is reputedly what was the first game of rugby in the North Island. [4] The first rugby game held at the Basin Reserve was between the Wellington football team and the crew of HMS Rosario, which the sailors won by a single goal.
Before sailing on the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain , the Australian rugby league team stopped in Wellington for an exhibition match at the Basin Reserve. [9]
The main scoreboard named after cricket historian Don Neely
The first Test match played at the ground was between New Zealand and England, beginning on 24 January 1930. One-day international cricket was played at the Basin Reserve until 1999, after which it moved to the larger crowd capacity Westpac Stadium on the other side of Wellington. In what may be a one-off occasion, it returned during the Australian Tour in 2005 following a decision that the pitch at Hamilton 's Westpac Park was unfit for cricket, however it is scheduled to host two One-day internationals in 2015/16 and 2016/17 against Pakistan and Bangladesh respectively.
On 13 March 2011, the Basin Reserve was host to "Fill the Basin" a cricket event intended to raise money for the 2011 Canterbury earthquake . The game was played in front of more than 10,000 people with people sitting between the boundary rope and the fence. This is the biggest crowd at the Basin Reserve in the modern era. Players involved in the match included Shane Warne , Stephen Fleming , Tana Umaga , Richard Hadlee , Martin Crowe , other famous former New Zealand cricketers, current All Blacks Richie McCaw and Conrad Smith and actors Russell Crowe , Ian McKellen . [10] More than $500,000 was raised towards the relief efforts. [11]
In addition to cricket, other sports have also used the Basin Reserve, including rugby union , a rugby league Test match, a football pre-season match and exhibition Australian rules football matches. The Basin Reserve was during the 1950s and 1960s the major football ground in the Wellington area and was the scene of a number of international matches and Chatham Cup finals.
Test matches[ edit ]
There have been 56 Test matches played at the Basin Reserve as of 2 March 2013. [12] The average runs per wicket is 31.42 while the average runs per wicket through New Zealand is 31.27. The average runs per over is 2.85. The ground is more noted as suiting fast bowlers as opposed to spin bowlers . Nine of the top ten wicket takers at the ground are fast bowlers with top wicket taker being Chris Martin with 58 [13] although he only has the 13th best bowling average on the ground. [14]
Brendon McCullum has the highest innings 302,and is the first Black Cap to pass 300 runs in a test. The previous highest score at the ground and for any NZ test cricketer was the 299 runs by Martin Crowe in 1991 [15] Almost a year later in 2015, Kumar Sangakkara scored his 12000th test runs and his 11th double century there while McCullum dropped three catches and scored a two-ball duck in the first innings. It is also a ground where Trent Boult made the most of his one-handed catches. One of which was the one that removed Sangakkara in 2015. In the same test, Kane Williamson scored his first test double century, with his 6th wicket partner BJ Watling scoring a century in the second innings. Williamson also contributed on the field to help NZ win the test match. His catch also made the top play on Sports Center in America [16]



Kimber: Ishant a national hero

Ishant Sharma , bowling short and aggressively with the old ball, produced one of the most memorable spells in the history of Indian fast bowling to destroy England's resistance in the second Investec Test at Lord's.
As India completed a 95-run victory 50 minutes before tea on the final day, it ended a run of more than three years without an overseas Test victory and left England befuddled and bereft as they contemplated a winless streak of 10 Tests and the continued failures of their senior players to contribute to a rapidly-changing landscape.
England's defeat, and the muddle-headed cricket they regularly played en route, will increase criticism of Alastair Cook's captaincy despite repeated protestations from England's hierarchy that he remained the man to lead them during a period of rapid change. As their innings ended to a farcical run-out, Cook and his coach Peter Moores, their dejection only half-hidden behind reflective sunglasses, were deep in conversation on the balcony.
But India, who won at Lord's for only the second time in 82 years, will have eyes only for the performance of Ishant, who returned career-best figures of 7 for 74 and invited comparisons with the brilliant spell in Perth in 2008 when he roughed up no less a player of fast bowling than Ricky Ponting and encouraged India's hopes that they had a great fast bowler to reckon with.
Ishant's career has never quite turned out like that, but one could imagine that the intervening years had not existed aen.
"The game [in Mohali] didn't go to plan right from the outset," Nielsen said. "We were under immense pressure and in no way able to get back in the game. We understand it's only a week since we played well in Bangalore. If we do the same in Delhi we will be competitive."
The India players spoke of their superiority in the first Test and many supporters in the country believe the team has dumped Australia as the No. 1 unit. Nielsen admitted India were better "over the past five days" but would not concede anything else.
"Our challenge is to ensure the momentum they have gathered does not carry itself through to the next two Tests," he said. "They're a talented side and have great experience, but we showed in Bangalore we can compete and put ourselves in winning positions."
The Delhi curator has promised a pitch that is a present for Anil Kumble, who missed the second game with a shoulder problem. Nielsen said it was important for his team not to obsess over the conditions.
"We have to accept it's not the WACA or the Gabba or Adelaide Oval, and accept it's Delhi," he said. "It's not what we're used to, but it's still a wicket, and we need to execute our skills. It does put a bit of pressure on Anil, coming back from injury to get a present like that. I hope he bowls well."
If the surface is helpful for the slow bowlers it could magnify the problems caused by Australia's lack of a high-quality spinner. Cameron White has been serviceable in his first two Tests without being consistently dangerous, while the offspinner Jason Krejza has been overlooked since suffering harsh punishment in the tour match in Hyderabad.
Krejza was originally picked in the squad ahead of White and might come into calculations if the Delhi pitch looks like offering sharp turn. Steve Waugh, Australia's former captain, said the slow bowling was not the reason for the heavy defeat in Mohali.
"We must be patient with Cameron White," Waugh wrote in the Hindu. "After all, he has just started his career and it's too early to jump to conclusions. However, I was surprised that Beau Casson, who was pretty good in the West Indies, did not make this tour.
"But then, it was decided that leg-spin and a finger-spinner were better options. They picked Jason Krejza because they reckoned he was good enough to play, so it's better to try him out rather than to die wondering."

It was a match that was never out of India's control. After the tremendous work done over four days, they needed less than a session on the fifth morning to defeat Australia, sealing the Test by 320 runs, their biggest margin of victory in terms of runs ever. Zaheer Khan nipped out three wickets in the space of four deliveries when play started, and though Michael Clarke resisted with 69,  it was always going to be a matter of when India would take a 1-0 series lead. In terms of runs, it was Australia's biggest defeat since their 343-run loss to West Indies in Barbados in 1991.
India had reduced Australia to 58 for 5 yesterday, but had to wait 84 runs for their next strike, after which proceedings resembled a bowling alley as Zaheer knocked over the lower order like nine-pins. Zaheer was simply unplayable. He broke through in the first over of the day, bowling Brad Haddin for 37 with a ripper. It pitched on a length, shaped back in, and took out the middle and off stumps. In his next over, Zaheer struck with his second and third deliveries and found himself on a hat-trick. A leaden-footed Cameron White went for a drive and edged to Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Next ball, Brett Lee had no clue to one pitched fractionally shorter and had his stumps splayed. Three wickets had fallen for three runs.
With nine men around the bat, Mitchell Johnson averted the hat-trick. Zaheer had slowly built up his momentum through the fourth day and struck gold on the fifth morning. He got the ball to move slightly away from the batsmen, and was very accurate. Ishant Sharma achieved movement both ways, evident when Clarke outside-edged towards slip - the ball didn't carry - and later inside-edged towards square leg.
Perhaps significant with two Tests to play, Clarke shrugged off an indifferent tour with a fluent 69. On a pitch with good movement and against bowlers who were on song, he batted with focus and determination. He and Johnson, who played well for his 26 before popping a return catch to Amit Mishra, added 50. Clarke had been the glue that held a poor Australian innings together, but he was last out when he clipped Mishra - who finished with seven on debut - to midwicket. As the fat lady sang and Punjabi bhangra filled the Mohali air, Dhoni - India's stand-in captain who rarely made a wrong call through the Test - led the charge towards the catcher, Virender Sehwag.
Teams that have a habit of winning know how to seize the momentum and never let it go. Like Australia had done for the last decade and more, India did that very well in Mohali. They were, unquestionably, the superior side in this Test.

One of Australia's strengths during the McGrath-Warne years was the bowlers' ability to maintain their line in most conditions. There were occasional costly lapses, like Kolkata in 2001 and Antigua in 2003, but they were the errors that made a dominating team human. The rest of the time they did the simple request that coaches repeat as often as Sufi musicians bang on a dhol. "Bowl to your field, bowl to your field."
Australia arrived in India with none of their fast bowlers having played a Test in the country, but they were sure it would not be a problem. It has been worse than that. The lack of impact is on the verge of becoming a series-losing issue.
Most worryingly, they are not sure where to bowl. It's not about lack of effort, but application and direction. Each time a player talks about how to operate on these surfaces he mentions "patience" so often it wears the patience of those listening. Yet on the field everything is happening in fast forward - and not just the speed of the ball heading to the boundary or the fielders in the deep. Dot balls have been forgotten and they seem to be looking for a wicket every delivery. Peter Siddle is the only rookie, but as a group they are copying the rawness.
The team analysts and coaches have devised clever settings using a range of short and deep fielders. In Bangalore the suffocation worked, as it had in the series win in 2004, due to tight bowling. During this game it has been the kind of operation expected of Test minnows, not those at the top of the table. No amount of manoeuvring by the captain or the coach can cover consistent mis-direction.
India's batsmen are amazing in their own conditions, but the Australians are refusing to learn. In Bangalore the lower order was allowed to escape and it happened again in Mohali. On Friday the new-ball spells of Brett Lee and Siddle allowed India to speed to 70 in 14 overs. Michael Slater used to do that to England and Australians lau Warne and Shane Watson for the following three seasons of the IPL, although Warne’s future continued to be uncertain. Yet, he decided to make this his final season for the Rajasthan Royals on the insistence of the team owners who felt that he was the ultimate source of inspiration for the team on and off the field. In the auction, the team’s funds were reduced since they were penalized by the BCCI in 2010 and as a result, had to pay a certain amount of bank guarantee as fixed by the High Court. But they possessed an adequate amount of money to buy some of the world’s finest T20 players, which they did not exactly.
They managed to buy back Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait for $USD 300,000 as well as South African bowling all-rounder Johan Botha for $USD 950,000. The other star players which they picked were New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor for $USD 1 million as well as ‘The Wall’ Rahul Dravid for half that price. England’s World T20 2010 winning skipper Paul Collingwood was also purchased for a mere $USD 250,000. The other players were mostly from the domestic circuits, but were confident individuals following Rajasthan winning the Ranji Trophy that year.
Rajasthan Royals began the IPL 2011 in grand fashion, beating the Kumar Sangakkara-led Deccan Chargers by 8 wickets, with the young Indian pacer Siddharth Trivedi adjudged the man of the match for his spell of 3/15 and the Royals continued their fine record against the Chargers. While Shane Warne defied age with a fine piece of bowling to assist Rajasthan in defeating a weakened Delhi Daredevils side by 6 wickets, with figures of 2/17.
However, their confidence was dented with two back-to-back defeats to the new look Kolkata Knight Riders in a span of three days. In the clash at Jaipur, they lost by 9 wickets courtesy a 100-run partnership between Gautam Gambhir and Jacques Kallis, Whereas in Kolkata, Lakshmipathy Balaji picked 3/15 in 4 overs on a minefield pitch in Eden Gardens to help his team pull of an 8 wicket victory. The match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bangalore was washed out due to rain, which made Rajasthan’s task of making it into the last four much tougher. Shaun Marsh was in great nick and his 42-ball 71 resulted in the Royals losing to Kings XI Punjab in Mohali by 48 runs. However, they pulled together a string of a hat-trick of home wins, as Rajasthan chased successfully in all the three matches. The first was against the Kochi Tuskers Kerala, winning by 8 wickets. Followed by Mumbai Indians, the No.1 team then on the points table as they chased down a total of 100 with 7 wickets to spare. And then the Pune Warriors India were undone by Ross Taylors’ 35-ball 47 not out, as Rajasthan won by 6 wickets.
But again it was inconsistency which let the Royals down badly. They were given a proper thumping by the eventual champions Chennai Super Kings in both the matches they played against each other, within a span of five days. The in-form Royal Challengers Bangalore thrashed them by 9 wickets courtesy Chris Gayle while they were bowled out for 97 in their 8-wicket defeat to the Kochi Tuskers Kerala. Although this time they ended their round robin matches well with a win against the Mumbai Indians in Mumbai and in the process giving Shane Warne a fitting farewell, Rajasthan were dismissed from the competition since they ended at the 6th position out of the 10 teams in the tournament, having again won 6 out of their 14 matches played, with one being a no result. [29]
2012 IPL season[ edit ]
Rajasthan Royals finished in seventh place among the point table in season 5 of IPL winning only seven matches out of sixteen. [42]
2013 IPL season[ edit ]
Rajasthan Royals qualified for the playoff stage by finishing third in the group stage, thus grabbing a spot in Champions League 2013. They won against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the eliminator but lost to Mumbai Indians in the second qualifier, which led to their exit from the tournament. [43] [44] Shane Watson was declared the Man of the tournament.
2013 spot-fixing case[ edit ]
On 16 May 2013, three Rajasthan Royals players Sreesanth , Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila were arrested from Mumbai by Delhi Police along with eleven bookies on charges of spot-fixing in the tournament. The fixing happened in the matches against Pune Warriors on 5 May, Kings XI Punjab on 9 May and Mumbai Indians on 15 May. [45] Later BCCI suspended the three players. [46]
2014 IPL season[ edit ]
Rajasthan Royals retained five players - Sanju Samson, Ajinkya Rahane, Shane Watson, James Faulkner and Stuart Binny - for the seventh season of the IPL. Rajasthan Royals scored 65 runs off the last 17 balls at a strike rate of 382.35 to win the match against RCB. [47] Shane Watson will lead the side in IPL season 7 and Rahul Dravid will play the role of a mentor. [48] [49]
Team anthem[ edit ]
The team anthem is 'Halla Bol'. In the first IPL season the song was sung by Ila Arun . [50] While in second season, it was sung by huudiya. [51]

Batting:



This article is about all-rounders in cricket.  For all-rounders in cycling, see Glossary of cycling#all-rounder .
For other uses, see Allround .
An all-rounder such as Andrew Flintoff is skilled at both batting (top) and bowling (bottom).
An all-rounder is a cricketer who regularly performs well at both batting and bowling . Although all bowlers must bat and quite a few batsmen do bowl occasionally, most players are skilled in only one of the two disciplines and are considered specialists. Some wicket-keepers have the skills of a specialist batsman and have been referred to as all-rounders, but the term wicketkeeper-batsman is more commonly applied to them.
There is no precise qualification for a player to be considered an all-rounder and use of the term tends to be subjective. The generally accepted criterion is that a "genuine all-rounder" is someone whose batting or bowling skills, considered alone, would be good enough to win him a place in the team for which he plays.[ citation needed ] Another definition of a "genuine all-rounder" is a player who can through both batting and bowling (though not necessarily both in the same match), consistently "win matches for the team" (i.e., propel his/her team to victory by an outstanding individual performance). By either definition, a genuine all-rounder is quite rare and extremely valuable to a team as he effectively operates as two players.
Confusion sometimes arises when a specialist bowler performs well with the bat. For example, the great West Indies pace bowler Malcolm Marshall achieved ten scores of 50 or above in 107 Test innings between 1978 and 1991, but had a batting average of less than 19. He would be termed a "useful lower-order batsman". Equally, a specialist batsmen may be termed a "useful change bowler" and a good example of this is Australian Allan Border , who in a Test match against the West Indies in Sydney in January 1989 took 11 wickets for 96 runs (7/46 in the first innings and 4/50 in the second) as the conditions suited his occasionally used left-arm spin. [1]
One of the main constraints to becoming a recognised all-rounder is that batsmen and bowlers "peak" at different ages. Batsmen tend to reach their peak in their late twenties after their technique has matured through experience. Conversely, fast bowlers often peak in their early to mid twenties at the height of their physical prowess. Other bowlers, mostly spinners but also fast bowlers who can "swing" the ball, are most effective in their later careers.[ citation needed ]
One commonly used statistical rule of thumb is that a player's batting average (the higher the better) should be greater than his bowling average (the lower the better). In Test cricket, only three all-rounders have batting averages that are 20 greater than their bowling average over their entire careers: Garfield Sobers , Jacques Kallis and Walter Hammond . However, some other players have achieved such a differential over significant parts of their careers, such as Imran Khan and Shane Watson. ( Michael Slater had a batting average of 42.8 and a bowling average of 10.0, but cases such as his are usually excluded by specifying a minimum number of matches, runs or wickets; Slater took only one wicket for a total of ten runs in his entire test career.) Doug Walters almost achieved the 20-run average differential with a batting average of 48.26 and a bowling average of 29.08, however he was generally regarded as an occasional bowler who could break partnerships rather than a genuine all-rounder.
In overall first-class cricket , there are several players with significantly higher batting averages. Statistically, few can challenge Frank Woolley who had a batting average of 40.77 and a bowling average of 19.87. Woolley took over 2000 wickets in his career, scored more runs than anyone except Jack Hobbs and is the only non-wicketkeeper to have taken more than 1000 catches. [2]
Fielding prowess is another important consideration when assessing a player's all-round ability. Besides Woolley, other great fielders who are termed all-rounders include W G Grace , Walter Hammond, Paul Collingwood ,Gary Sobers and Jacques Kallis. They were all very athletic fields and safe catchers.
Essentially, an all-rounder is better at bowling than batting or vice versa. Very few are equally good at both and hardly any have been outstanding at both. Thus the terms "bowling all-rounder" and "batting all-rounder" have come into use.[ citation needed ] For example, Richard Hadlee had an excellent bowling average of 22.29 in Tests and a solid (yet unspectacular) batting average of 27.16, leading him to be termed a "bowling all-rounder". Meanwhile, a player like Jacques Kallis (batting average of 56.10 and bowling average of 32.43 in Tests) is known as a "batting all-rounder". [3]
An all-rounder who missed out on Test Cricket due to the apartheid era of the 1970s and 1980s was the South African Clive Rice . His first-class batting average was 40.95 and his bowling average was 22.49. Another outstanding South African all-rounder was Mike Procter who played only seven tests for the same reason, taking 41 wickets at an average of 15.02. His batting averages were 25.11 in tests and 36.01 in first-class cricket, and he scored 48 first-class centuries in 401 matches including an equal-record six in consecutive innings.

Mythology[ edit ]
Parasurama , surrounded by settlers, commanding Varuna (the Hindu God of water) to part the seas and reveal Kerala
Dahsavthar stories of Hindu mythology were linked to Kerala by Aryan settlers from north. According to them, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama , 6th avatar of Vishnu , hence Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram ("The Land of Parasurama"). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari . [11] The consensus among scientific geographers is that a substantial portion of this area was under the sea in ancient times. [12] The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki , who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. The legend was later expanded, and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with Keralolpathi , which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society, such as land tenure and administration, to the story of Parasurama. [13] In medieval times Kuttuvan may have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into the sea to symbolize his lordship over it. [14]
Another much earlier Puranic character associated with Kerala is Mahabali , an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He won the war against the Devas , driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to Patala (the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala. [15] The Matsya Purana , among the oldest of the 18 Puranas , [16] [17] uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu ) as the setting for the story of Lord Matsya , the first incarnation of Lord Vishnu, and King Manu , the first man and the king of the region. [18] [19]
Main article: Pre-history of Kerala
A dolmen erected by Neolithic people in Marayur
Pre-historical archaeological findings include dolmens of the Neolithic era in the Marayur area of the Idukki district. They are locally known as "muniyara", derived from muni ( hermit or sage ) and ara (dolmen). [20] Rock engravings in the Edakkal Caves , in Wayanad are thought to date from the Neolithic era around 6000 BCE. [21] [22] Archaeological studies have identified many Mesolithic , Neolithic and Megalithic sites in Kerala. [23] The studies point to the development of ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age , through the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic Ages. [24] Foreign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation; [25] historians suggest a possible relationship with Indus Valley Civilization during the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age . [26]
Ancient period[ edit ]
Silk Road map. The spice trade was mainly along the water routes (blue).
Kerala was a major spice exporter from 3000 BCE, according to Sumerian records and it is still referred to as the "Garden of Spices" or as the "Spice Garden of India". [27] [28] Kerala's spices attracted ancient Babylonians , Assyrians and Egyptians to the Malabar Coast in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE. Arabs and Phoenicians established trade with Kerala during this period. [29] The Land of Keralaputra was one of the four independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka 's time, the others being Chola , Pandya , and Satiyaputra . [30] Scholars hold that Keralaputra is an alternate name of the Cheras , the first dominant dynasty based in Kerala. [31] [32] These territories once shared a common language and culture, within an area known as Tamilakam . [33] While the Cheras ruled most of modern Kerala, its southern tip was in the kingdom of Pandyas, [34] which had a trading port sometimes identified in ancient Western sources as Nelcynda (or Neacyndi). [35] Later, the region fell under the control of the Pandyas, Cheras, and Cholas. Ays and Mushikas were two other dynasties of ancient Kerala, whose kingdoms lay to the south and north of Cheras respectively. [36] [37]
In the last centuries BCE the coast became important to the Greeks and Romans for its spices, especially black pepper . The Cheras had trading links with China , West Asia , Egypt, Greece, and the Roman Empire . In foreign-trade circles the region was known as Male or Malabar. [38] Muziris , Berkarai, and Nelcynda were among the principal ports at that time. [39] The value of Rome's annual trade with the region was estimated at around 50,000,000 sesterces ; [40] contemporary Sangam literature describes Roman ships coming to Muziris in Kerala, laden with gold to exchange for pepper. One of the earliest western traders to use the monsoon winds to reach Kerala was Eudoxus of Cyzicus , around 118 or 166 BCE, under the patronage of Ptolemy VIII , king of the Hellenistic Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypble for Ricky Ponting's low scores on Indian soil - he dismissed him five times under 12 in the 2001 series - and some his punchiest batting performances has come against them too. But in 2008 his confrontation with Andrew Symonds created one of the ugliest controversies in cricket - he was initially charged with racial insult, which was reduced to abuse on appeal. Later that year, he was banned for whole IPL season for slapping Sreesanth, his Indian team-mate. When he channels his natural combativeness in the right direction, he can be a fiercely competitive and dangerous opponent. He was expected to be India's lead spinner in the all three forms of the game after Anil Kumble's retirement, but following a run of poor form was dropped from India's Test team for home series against West Indies and the tour of Australia in the 2011-12 season.
Harbhajan eventually made a comeback to the Test side, and became the 10th Indian to have played 100 Tests when he took field against Australia in Chennai.
However, he was dropped after the next Test and was banished to the domestic set-up. He performed impressively for Mumbai Indians in the 2015 IPL, collecting 16 wickets in 14 games, and was later recalled for the lone Test against Bangladesh that year.

Rajkot rampage
He unleashes what. Various Roman establishments in the port cities of the region, such as a temple of Augustus and barracks for garrisoned Roman soldiers, are marked in the Tabula Peutingeriana ; the only surviving map of the Roman cursus publicus . [41] [42]
Merchants from West Asia and Southern Europe established coastal posts and settlements in Kerala. [43] The Jewish connection with Kerala started in 573 BCE. [44] [45] [46] Arabs also had trade links with Kerala, starting before the 4th century BCE, as Herodotus (484–413 BCE) noted that goods brought by Arabs from Kerala were sold to the Jews at Eden. [39] They intermarried with local people, resulting in formation of the Muslim Mappila community. [47] In the 4th century, some Christians also migrated from Persia and joined the early Syrian Christian community who trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. [48] [49] Mappila was an honorific title that had been assigned to respected visitors from abroad; Jewish, Syrian Christian, and Muslim immigration account for later names of the respective communities: Juda Mappilas , Nasrani Mappilas , and Muslim Mappilas . [50] [51] According to the legends of these communities, the earliest churches , [52] mosque , [53] and synagogue (1568 CE) [54] in India were built in Kerala. [47]
Early medieval period[ edit ]
Tharisapalli plates granted to Saint Thomas Christians testify that merchant guilds and trade corporations played a very significant role in the economy and social life during the Kulasekhara period.
A Second Chera Kingdom (c. 800–1102), also known as Kulasekhara dynasty of Mahodayapuram , was established by Kulasekhara Varman , which ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu. During the early part of the Kulasekara period, the southern region from Nagerkovil to Thiruvalla was ruled by Ay kings , who lost their power in the 10th century, making the region a part of the Kulasekara empire. [55] [56] Under Kulasekhara rule, Kerala witnessed a developing period of art, literature, trade and the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. [57] A Keralite identity, distinct from the Tamils , became linguistically separate during this period. [58] For local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Naduvazhis , with each province comprising a number of Desams under the control of chieftains, called as Desavazhis. [57]
The inhibitions, caused by a series of Chera-Chola wars in the 11th century, resulted in the decline of foreign trade in Kerala ports. Buddhism and Jainism disappeared from the land. [59] The social system became fractured with divisions on caste lines. [60] Finally, the Kulasekhara dynasty was subjugated in 1102 by the combined attack of Later Pandyas and Later Cholas . [55] However, in the 14th century, Ravi Varma Kulashekhara (1299–1314) of the southern Venad kingdom was able to establish a short-lived supremacy over southern India. After his death, in the absence of a strong central power, the state was divided into thirty small warring principalities; the most powerful of them were the kingdom of Samuthiri in the north, Venad in the south and Kochi in the middle. In the 18th Century, Travancore King Sree Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma annexed all the kingdoms up to Northern Kerala through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to pre-eminence in Kerala. The Kochi ruler sued for peace with Anizham Thirunal and Malabar came under direct British rule until India became independent . [61] [62]
Colonial era[ edit ]
The path Vasco da Gama took to reach India (black line)
The maritime spice trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean stayed with Arabs during the High and Late Middle Ages . However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery during which the spice trade, particularly in black pepper , became an influential activity for European traders. [63] Around the 15th century, the Portuguese began to dominate eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular, culminating in Vasco Da Gama 's arrival in Kappad Kozhikode in 1498. [64] [65] The Zamorin of Kozhikode permitted the new visitors to trade with his subjects such that Portuguese trade in Kozhikode prospered with the establishment of a factory and a fort. However, Portuguese attacks on Arab properties in his jurisdiction provoked the Zamorin and led to conflicts between them. The Portuguese took advantage of the rivalry between the Zamorin and the King of Kochi and allied with Kochi. When Francisco de Almeida was appointed as Viceroy of Portuguese India in 1505, his headquarters was established at Fort Kochi ( Fort Emmanuel ) rather than in Kozhikode. During his reign, the Portuguese managed to dominate relations with Kochi and established a few fortresses on the Malabar coast. [66] However, the Portuguese suffered setbacks from attacks by Zamorin forces; especially from naval attacks under the leadership Kozhikode admirals known as Kunjali Marakkars , which compelled them to seek a treaty. In 1571, the Portuguese were defeated by the Zamorin forces in the battle at Chaliyam fort . [67]
The Portuguese were ousted by the Dutch East India Company , who during the conflicts between the Kozhikode and the Kochi , gained control of the trade. [68] The Dutch in turn were weakened by constant battles with Marthanda Varma of the Travancore Royal Family , and were defeated at the Battle of Colachel in 1741. [69] An agreement, known as "Treaty of Mavelikkara", was signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753, according to which the Dutch were compelled to detach from all political involvement in the region. [70] [71] [72] Marthanda Varma annexed many northern kingdoms through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to a position of preeminence in Kerala. [73]
In 1766, Hyder Ali , the ruler of Mysore invaded northern Kerala . [74] His son and successor, Tipu Sultan , launched campaigns against the expanding British East India Company , resulting in two of the four Anglo-Mysore Wars . [75] [76] Tipu ultimately ceded the Malabar District and South Kanara to the Company in the 1790s; both were annexed to the Madras Presidency of British India in 1792. [77] [78] [79] The Company forged tributary alliances with Kochi in 1791 and Travancore in 1795. [80] By the end of 18th century, the whole of Kerala fell under the control of the British, either administered directly or under suzerainty . [81] There were major revolts in Kerala during the independence movement in the 20th century; most notable among them is the 1921 Malabar Rebellion and the many social struggles in Travancore . In the Malabar Rebellion, Mappila Muslims of Malabar rioted against Hindu zamindars and the British Raj . [82] Some social struggles against caste inequalities also erupted in the early decades of 20th century, leading to the 1936 Temple Entry Proclamation that opened Hindu temples in Travancore to all castes. [83]
Post colonial period[ edit ]
After British India was partitioned in 1947 into India and Pakistan, Travancore and Kochi , part of the Union of India were merged on 1 July 1949 to form Travancore-Cochin . [84] On 1 November 1956, the taluk of Kasargod in the South Kanara district of Madras , the Malabar district of Madras , and Travancore-Cochin, without four southern taluks (which joined Tamil Nadu ), merged to form the state of Kerala under the States Reorganisation Act . [85] [86] A Communist -led government under E. M. S. Namboodiripad resulted from the first elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957. [86] It was one of the earliest elected Communist governments, after Communist success in the 1945 elections in the Republic of San Marino . [87] [88] [89]

India in Australia 2008-09 October 22, 2008
Shoulders won't droop, says Clarke

Michael Clarke insists Australia will stay positive

The last time Australia was behind in a Test series was the 2005 Ashes when the side unravelled by the day and was a gloomy shadow by the finish. Michael Clarke was in England three years ago and is certain the mood in this team will remain much brighter despite the 320-run thrashing in Mohali.
"Things just seemed to continue to roll on in that Ashes series and we couldn't pull anything back," Clarke said. "I don't think that's like that here. We've still seen some very good individual performances so far, we just need the whole team to click."
Australia were out-batted and out-bowled throughout the second Test and when the players return from three days off they will work on ways to counter India's reverse-swing, spin and increasingly aggressive attitude. And in the field there is a requirement to build more pressure against batsmen who have been ready to explode.
The Mohali result means Australia have not beaten India in their past four Tests, starting with the loss in Perth in the aftermath of the Sydney affair . A run without success like that hasn't happened since 2005 either, but Clarke is not worried about the team's No. 1 ranking being in danger.
"The reality is it's not the first Test I've lost for Australia and it certainly won't be the last," he said. "We'll enjoy the time off, get back in and prepare for third test - let's hope it's 1-1 after that." Clarke will rest with his girlfriend Lara Bingle before she heads to London for a modelling job.
As vice-captain, Clarke has extra responsibility before Wednesday's third Test, but the debrief started with a few beers at the team hotel on Tuesday night. There were no naughty-boy nets and when the squad reconvenes in Delhi there will be team meetings, but not a dramatic overhaul.
"With my experience in India, (I can say) it's a place you can be brought down so quickly," he said. "It can also go the other way. With one good innings, it can turn around so quickly. We've still got a lot of experience, we know the conditions."
Clarke had a slow opening to the series with two failures in Bangalore followed by his last-over dismissal to Amit Mishra in the first innings in Mohali. He was pleased to break through with 69 before he confirmed the loss and was the last man out.
"When I look at my own performance I've been disappointed I haven't been as successful as I would have liked," he said. "I've put time into preparation and gone to nets during the days when we've batted to get a lot of practice."
Clarke is aware of India's fine record in Delhi, but is not about to call for changes in Australia's slow-bowling make-up. On Wednesday the curator at the Feroz Shah Kotla said the pitch would be a present to Anil Kumble.
Clarke said his bowing had been "okay" in the first two Tests, but he will need to create some more incisions to help the team in the third game. "I know the wicket coming up in Delhi has suited India and I see that as a great challenge," he said. "I know we're going to have to face some good spinners and some good reverse-swing bowlers."
Overall Clarke said Australia's approach would not change. "I remember after the first Test when we had a draw and we were getting on the bus and Punter said to Peter Siddle: 'Mate, you won't see too many results like that in this team.' And it's true. In the Australian team we win, we want to win every game we play."

At his sublime best, VVS Laxman is a sight for the gods. Wristy, willowy and sinuous, he can match - sometimes even better - Tendulkar for strokeplay. His on-side game is comparable to his idol Azharuddin's, yet he is decidedly more assured on the off side and has the rare gift of being able to hit the same ball to either side. The Australians, who have suffered more than most, paid the highest compliment after India's 2003-04 tour Down Under by admitting they did not know where to bowl to him. Laxman, a one-time medical student, finally showed signs of coming to terms with his considerable gifts in March 2001, as he tormented Steve Waugh's thought-to-be-invincible Australians with a majestic 281 to stand the Kolkata Test on its head. But even though he had another wonderful series against the Australians in 2003-04 with two centuries, one of them involving a back-from-the-dead, match-winning, 300-plus partnership with Kolkata ally Rahul Dravid at Adelaide, he hasn't quite managed the consistency that could have turned him into a batting great.  Between dazzling and sometimes workmanlike hundreds, he has suffered the frustration of numerous twenties and thirties and has lost his place in the one-day side. Nothing, though, has deterred him from tormenting his favourite opponents with silken strokes and piles of runs: in the course of the double-hundred at Feroz Shah Kotla in 2008, he became the second Indian batsman after Tendulkar to score more than 2000 runs against the Australians. A couple of years later, batting with a runner due to back spasms, he conjured up a magical unbeaten 73 in a thrilling run-chase in Mohali.
However, in 2011 the runs dried up in two successive overseas trips - in eight innings in England he scored 182, and then the poor run continued in his favourite country and against his favourite opponent, Australia. With India losing those matches badly, his future as an international player was suddenly under threat.
There were calls from former players and commentators questioning Laxman's selection for the two-Test home series against New Zealand in August 2012. On August 18, though, less than a week before the series was to begin in his hometown Hyderabad, Laxman announced his retirement from international cricket with immediate effect, resisting the temptation to end his career in front of his home crowd.

Watchman, conman, and the whole pain thing

Third time's no charm: Matthew Hayden fell to Zaheer Khan again
© Getty Images
 
Watchman by night, conman by day
Last night, it was a surprise when India chose to send in Ishant Sharma after Sachin Tendulkar's dismissal 12 minutes before stumps. But the nightwatchman did his job, and more. Yesterday he played most of the bowling from the time he came till the players went off the field - 15 balls out of the 19 bowled since his arrival yesterday.
Today, unintentionally, he may have done India another favour by getting out to a short, rising delivery. Australia went in with that plan afterwards for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sourav Ganguly, too, and the two received the gifts with ferocity and gratitude.
Wise move of the day
In the 128th over of India's innings, Dhoni disproved the law of equal and opposite reaction. Cameron White bowled him a gentle, flat delivery, but it was sent back to him about 1367 times the pace. White smartly didn't go for the catch. With 465 already given away already, four runs wouldn't have cost Australia a lot. But White did make sure his tour didn't end right there, because had he got his hands to the ball, only God could have blessed his fingers.
Zaheer - 3, Hayden - 0
Harbhajan Singh versus Ricky Ponting is history, for there is a new one-sided love story playing at a stadium near - or away - from you. Zaheer Khan has found a liking for Matthew Hayden, and the external forces have started conspiring to make the love materialise. Zaheer got some help from Asad Rauf in dismissing Hayden off the third ball of the innings. He dismissed Hayden in the second innings, too, lbw this time with one that might have just slid down leg. Again, in Hayden's third innings of the series, Hayden contrived to get out. The ball hit his pad, then his inside edge, and then the middle stump. Poor old Matty. He had spent more than nine hours on the field.
Mended when broke
In the fourth over of the morning, when Brett Lee tried to run Ishant out, he failed to collect cleanly a throw that was wide of the stumps. He split his webbing on the right hand in the process, and had to go off to get two stitches on the webbing. But when he came back later in the day, he seemed back to full fitness. He took a catch, falling backwards at long-ff, to dismiss the centurion Ganguly.
Oops, Rudi did it again
What he gave to Ganguly yesterday, Rudi Koertzen took from Dhoni today. When he didn't consult the third umpire before turning down an appeal for a stumping - Ganguly's foot was in air then - he gave him a chance to get to a hundred, which he dutifully did. But when Dhoni looked close to a hundred, he came face to face with the wrath of Rudi. When he was given out lbw off Peter Siddle, it appeared he had played the ball, and at any rate it hit Dhoni outside the line of off stump. What are the chances Dhoni would give Kumar Sangakkara a call in the evening?
There's no such thing as pain
Dhoni came out like a happy hooker today, dismissing everything short. But when Lee, bowling from round the stumps, tuck him up with a perfect short-pitched delivery, straight, and shoulder high, Dhoni played it out in his own original way. The bat stayed low, and seeing there was no way to move out of the line, he took the blow on his body. The scene, though, looked like a tennis ball hit a brick wall. And Dhoni went back to hooking.

Profile
Some felt he couldn't play the bouncer, others swore that he was God on the off-side; some laughed at his lack of athleticism, others took immense pride in his ability to galvanise a side. Sourav Ganguly's ability to polarise opinion led to one of the most fascinating dramas in Indian cricket. Yet, nobody can dispute that he was India's most successful Test captain - forging a winning unit from a bunch of talented, but directionless, individuals - and nobody can argue about him being one of the greatest one-day batsmen of all time. Despite being a batsman who combined grace with surgical precision in his strokeplay, his career had spluttered to a standstill before being resurrected by a scintillating hundred on debut at Lord's in 1996. Later that year, he was promoted to the top of the order in ODIs and, along with Sachin Tendulkar, formed one of the most destructive opening pairs in history.
When he took over the captaincy after the match-fixing exposes in 2000, he quickly proved to be a tough, intuitive and uncompromising leader. Under his stewardship India started winning Test matches away, and put together a splendid streak that took them all the way to the World Cup final in 2003. Later that year, in Australia, an unexpected and incandescent hundred at Brisbane set the tone for the series where India fought the world's best team to a standstill. Victory in Pakistan turned him into a cult figure but instead of being a springboard for greater things, it was the peak of a slippery slope.
The beginning of the end came in 2004 at Nagpur - when his last-minute withdrawal played a part in Australia clinching the series - and things went pear shaped when his loss of personal form coincided with India's insipid ODI performances. Breaking point was reached when his differences with Greg Chappell leaked into public domain and his career was in jeopardy when India began their remarkable revival under Rahul Dravid.
His gritty 30s at Karachi, when India succumbed to a humiliating defeat in early 2006, weren't enough for him to retain his spot and some felt he would never get another chance. Others, as always, thought otherwise and they were proved right when he was included in the Test squad for the away series in South Africa in 2006-2007. He  ended as the highest Indian run-scorer in that series and capped his fairytale comeback with four half-centuries on his return to ODIs. He continued his fine run in England, where he finished as the second highest scorer in Tests, and went on to slam back-to-back hundreds against Pakistan at home, the second of which was a glorious 239 in Bangalore. Ganguly was surprisingly omitted from India's ODI squad for the CB Series in Australia and has been out of contention in the one-day squad since. After a poor Test series in Sri Lanka, there were reports of him considering retirement but he was given a lifeline in the Tests against Australia at home. Two days before the first Test, he said the series would be his last.

Final frontier remains
End of a month of enthralling Test cricket. Ganguly is the leading face of a brash, aggressive Indian team who come back from an impossible situation to beat Australia 2-1 . Is vindicated as a captain.
November, 2001
Tête-à-tête with match-referee
In an unprecedented and highly controversial action, Ganguly and five other Indian players are summoned by Mike Denness, the match-referee, and warned for excessive appealing during the Port Elizabeth Test . He is also accused of not controlling his players, and is punished with a suspended ban for one Test match and two one-day international matches. India lose the three-Test series 2-0, and the third is deemed unofficial by the ICC amid threats of a revolt by India and the BCCI.

Decline continues
The signs of his decline are obvious after a dismal showing in a drawn series at home against Pakistan. Pakistan side triumphs in the decider at Bangalore, virtually signalling the end of the successful Ganguly-Wright relationship. Ganguly scores 48 runs in the series, at 9.60.
April 12, 2005

After hundred, comes nadir
A slow hundred against a depleted Zimbabwe sends the critics into raptures, only for the controversial Ganguly-Greg Chappell saga to blow up in everyone's faces. Ganguly goes public with his dismay at Chappell's suggestions during the match that he step down from the captaincy, and the media goes wild. Chappell is not amused, maintaining that the Indian captain asked him for his honest opinion on his form and leadership in a private meeting between the two. The tour goes on, with India unsurprisingly beating Zimbabwe 2-0. On the team's return to India Ganguly is publicly ostracised and there are more and more calls for his sacking. Forty-eight hours after saying that he respected the Indian captain and looked forward to working with him in the future, Chappell fires off a damning memorandum to the BCCI.

Two days before the start of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, announces it will be his last series. There have been talks doing the rounds that the BCCI has been trying to force the seniors into retirmement. He first denies such notions in a press conference, and then when the presser is over, makes the announcement. "Just one last thing lads, before I leave," he says. "I just want to say that this is going to be my last series. I've decided to quit. I told my team-mates before coming here. These four Test matches are going to be my last and hopefully we'll go on a winning note."

Best Performances
131 v England, Lord's, 1996
It has been a month since he last played an international, and four-and-a-half years since he played one before that. Those are also his only two to date. His selection is already the most controversial aspect on the tour - allegedly a work of quota system. After India have squandered the initiative and let England score 344 after having them down at 107 for 5, a familiar story looks in the offing. On a chilly third morning, Ganguly is imperious through the off side, driving both through the covers and behind point. He pulls the short ones capably and hits 20 boundaries in what seems an inevitable century.
Sahara Cup v Pakistan, Toronto, 1997
The kits are still white, the ball is still swinging, and India-Pakistan clashes are still rare. In his 34 ODIs till date, Ganguly has scored only one century and taken only one wicket. The wickets here are to his immense liking; he bowls accurately, getting just enough movement at just about the right pace, taking a wicket every 20 balls, and for 10 runs each. He is winning matches with the bat too, the most significant being the run-a-ball 75 as India successfully chase 160 in 26 overs. He ends up the best batsman and the best bowler in both the sides. He is the Man of the Match in the first match of the next year's Sahara Cup too.
124 v Pakistan, Independence Cup final, Dhaka, 1997-98
A target of over 300 has been chased successfully only once in the past. India are chasing 315 against Pakistan, in the third of the best-of-three finals. Sachin Tendulkar gets off to a blazing start, but gets out for 41. Robin Singh scores a run-a-ball 80 too, but it's Ganguly who holds the innings together with a well-paced 124. When he gets out, India are close enough, but go on to make a mess before finally winning in dramatic fashion.
« Prev  Showing 1 of 4 Next »
183 v Sri Lanka, Taunton, 1999
True wicket, short boundaries, put in and at one down in first over, Rahul Dravid joins Ganguly. After Dravid sets the pace, Ganguly goes on to make it his day. He moves from elegant to downright brutal, his century coming up in 119 balls, and the next 83 in only 39 balls.
153* and 1 for 33 v New Zealand, Gwalior, 1999-2000
The next best scores are 45, 15, 15. It is a damp wicket and Indian top order, bar Ganguly has struggled. He hangs in, though, to find able support in Robin Singh, as they put on 119 in the last 11.3 overs. Ganguly is in supreme touch and with 18 fours and three sixes, scores about 59 per cent of the team runs in exactly half of the legal deliveries. For good measure, he bowls economically as first change after Nathan Astle has got stuck into Debasis Mohanty.
141 v Pakistan, Adelaide, 2000-01
It's traditional rivals again, this time in the middle of a horrible Australian summer for both the teams. Pakistan, though, have improved during the one-dayers; India are yet to win their first international. On a true pitch, Ganguly rolls out his full repertoire of strokes. He puts on 88 in 15 overs with Tendulkar for the first wicket, 87 in 20 with Dravid for the second, and makes sure the good work is not squandered by staying there until the 49th over.
« Prev Showing 2 of 4 Next »
18 and 98* v Sri Lanka, Kandy, 2001
India are never known for their fourth-innings batting. With Tendulkar not around, and on a fourth-day Kandy wicket, India have to chase 264 . Ganguly's captaincy has already come in for severe criticism, but this time he needs badly to come good with the bat - he has not scored a fifty for the last 13 innings. He does come good, playing sensibly and in partnership with Dravid, negating the threat of Muttiah Muralitharan.
144 v Australia, Brisbane, 2003-04
It wouldn't be unfair to say this is the test of Ganguly's manhood. His batting record as captain is not impressive, Australians have, as tradition is, gone after the captain. Amid talk of chin music and talks of trying to defend the batting order by opting to bowl first, Ganguly walks in at 62 for 3, last three having fallen for one run. What follows is a breathtaking counter-attack that sets the tone for the whole series. The off side is packed, waiting for what they think is an inevitable catch. Instead, Ganguly peppers the field with 87 runs through the off side, with 12 boundaries.
239 and 91 v Pakistan, Bangalore, 2007-08
At 61 for 4, having fallen to early-morning freshness, India are threatening to yet again squander a lead in the Test-series decider . In comes Yuvraj Singh to join Ganguly, seemingly carrying a new wicket to bat on. For 65.2 overs and 300 runs, Pakistan can only watch the two sprint away with the game. When Yuvraj gets out for 169, Ganguly is unbeaten on 124. He is no mood to give up yet, and goes on to score his first double-century, and when he gets out with the team total at 605, the matter has been put beyond Pakistan. The obituaries, written for three years now and brushed up time and again, can safely be burnt.

87 v South Africa, Kanpur, 2007-08
Looking to avoid an embarrassing series defeat, India get a track that starts cracking on the first day, spinning in the first session, and batting is extremely difficult. Advantage Indian, right? Wrong. After South Africa have scored 265, their fast bowlers have made life hell for Indian batsmen. At 123 for 4, India look like they might lose on a track tailormade for them. Ganguly not only survives, but takes control of the rest of the innings, scoring 87 out of the 166 that are scored during his stay at the crease. Although his runs come in 119 deliveries, he never looks hurried, serene almost. His innings carries India past South Africa's total, and lays foundation for a face-saving Test win . He later calls this one of his best innings in Test cricket, and for good reason.

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali, 1st day October 17, 2008
Tendulkar's mission control

There was plenty of reason for the actual game to get sidetracked today, but Sachin Tendulkar put matters, and India, back on track

The lead-up to this Test had been full of distractions - Anil Kumble's injury, the players still fighting like children over who brought forward moral victories from Bangalore, the unseasonal rains in Mohali raising doubts over the match going the distance. Around a quarter past one on the first day more distractions were about to unfold. When Rahul Dravid played Brett Lee onto his stumps, the Test sort of took a back seat and another aside started: Sachin Tendulkar's progress towards Brian Lara's record.
It was a pretty edgy hour and a quarter - so edgy it was surreal - that followed, during which Tendulkar made his way to the record and India lost two more wickets. What followed immediately after was more distraction from Test-match cricket: fire-crackers went off at the PCA Stadium and continued for three minutes. The Australians rushing to congratulate Tendulkar was expected but when it happened it felt unreal coming from a team that plays its cricket hard.
There would be other milestones to follow, too: Tendulkar would go past 12,000 runs and Sourav Ganguly past 7000. But when Tendulkar bats as he did for the next two hours, distractions don't matter. Effortlessly, he brought people back to the actual game and, with Ganguly's help, India into the match.
India had a confident, brisk start on a pitch conducive to one; the bounce was true but not big and there was no sideways movement. The immediate assessment was a total close to 500 would be par for this track. Gautam Gambhir and Dravid looked to put India on the way, but failed to score centuries - crucial for both of them, for different reasons - that appeared there for the taking. This was a pitch on which a batsman, once settled, would kick himself for not reaching three figures.
Gambhir is due a big score. He has done well since forcing his way back to the Test side following his limited-overs success, and has been a good foil to Virender Sehwag at the top. He has scored 427 runs in nine innings on comeback, against tough opposition and in trying conditions, but his best has been 72. That he gets starts points to his form - perhaps the best of his career - but he also leaves the team in a spot of bother by not converting those starts into big innings, as he did today and during the first innings at the PSS in Sri Lanka this summer. In 19 Tests Gambhir only has one century, against Bangladesh. That should be enough to rile and inspire him.
The way he batted in the first session today, it seemed certain Gambhir would end that century drought. For some reason, despite being an excellent rotator of strike in limited-overs cricket, he got bogged down when the field spread and the bowling became accurate. Having eased to 25 from 39 balls, Gambhir slowed down. He went into lunch on 53 from 90 balls and in the next hour or so he faced 50 balls for just 14 runs.
If this was uncharacteristic, so was Dravid's innings. Instead of the patchy starts he's had recently, Dravid began, instinctively speaking, the way he did when at the top of his game.  But this was his 11th score between 30 and 100, to go with one century, in his last 15 Tests. When scoring was made difficult, Dravid didn't seem to show the kind of patience one associates with him. Once he went after a delivery wide outside off stump, and missed. In his prime Dravid would have left such deliveries alone for the neghed at how badly they bowled. The pattern continued in the second innings on Sunday, and again on Monday.
After giving away 100 in 23 overs on the third afternoon, they allowed India 55 runs in the first ten of the next morning. The rate for the day was five an over. In a Test.  An hour after the mistakes of the third day, Watson had talked of a team meeting where the players discussed how they would rein in the batsmen. Free rein was given instead.
The bowling coach Troy Cooley is travelling with the team, but his magic either hasn't worked in India or has worn off. Cooley was part of England's sweet success in 2005, when the fast men curled the ball at will and exposed Australia's weakness against movement. This time Australia is behind on the trickery again.
They are desperately trying to achieve reverse-swing early in the innings - the Indians manage it within 15 overs - and have watched closely how their opponents deliver seam-up for about eight overs and then across the seam to deteriorate its condition. Watson also spoke about getting one side of the ball really rough while keeping the other shiny. This is reverse-swing at its most elementary level. The Indians must be laughing.
SG balls are used in India, not the Kookaburra brand preferred in Australia, and they have a more prominent seam and soften quickly. The Australians have been practising with them for a long time - although it's impossible to match the experience of the locals - but can't get much off the pitch or in the air. When Australia bat it's tempting to think the bone-coloured surface has turned green. It hasn't.
Four years ago when Australia's bowlers nullified the home batsmen and won the unwinnable series, they focused on a direct line at the stumps. Michael Kasprowicz and Jason Gillespie altered their games, slowing down a touch to focus on a consistent line, and Glenn McGrath also readjusted slightly. All were experienced bowlers who had tested themselves in a variety of conditions. All had an economy rate of less than three runs an over in India and collected between 19 and 33 wickets.

Lee, who is giving up 3.16 an over, has been the biggest problem. He is not as tall as his former team-mates and the lack of bounce has taken away one of his weapons. In different spells he has varied his pace, but apart from a strong comeback after a horrible opening on the first day, he has been made to look like a medium-pacer. In the year leading up to this series he was the best bowler in the game.
Mitchell Johnson has performed extremely well in India until the second innings in Mohali, where he rejoined the pack. Siddle is young, raw and bowling as expected while Shane Watson, Michael Clarke and Cameron White are doing the same. It would be easy to say they are missing Stuart Clark, who has a sore right elbow, but he was below-par in Bangalore.
India's batsmen have been able to cut, pull, drive - pretty much everything except use regular defence. It is not the way the Australians came to play, but at the moment they don't seem capable of doing anything about it. India are on track for a 1-0 lead and will have few problems in shutting down the series when it resumes in Delhi on October 29. Australia have forgotten about containment and it has cost them.

Profile
A level-headed cricketer of immense talent, Cameron White long seemed destined to play a significant role for Australia. At the start of his career it was hard to know whether he would develop into a nagging legspinner, aggressive middle-order batsman, intuitive skipper, or a bit of all three. After being tried as a Test leggie in India in 2008, it became apparent that batting was his focus and he developed into a destructive stroke-maker in the shorter formats. His maturity was recognised when he was named as Australia's Twenty20 captain in 2011. The appointment lasted only a year due to his batting form but it was a natural fit, for he had nearly a decade of captaincy experience having led Victoria in 2003-04 at the age of 20. The youngest skipper in their history, he won rave reviews for his cool head and warm handling of more hardened contemporaries. For all that, he remained a largely unassuming country lad. Picked to tour Zimbabwe when Stuart MacGill withdrew for moral reasons, White cancelled a fishing trip to attend the press conference then boyishly shrugged aside questions about the circumstances of his selection. He was chosen as much for his no-frills batting as his bowling; David Hookes, the late Victorian coach, felt White's best chance of representing Australia was to earn a top-six spot.
White first emerged as a peculiarly unAustralian-style legspinner, tall and robust, relying on changes of pace and a handy wrong'un rather than prodigious turn or flight. He would even start a spell with an offspinner or quicker ball. As far back as December 2002 his hero Shane Warne had predicted: "I think he's a [future] Australian player provided he sticks to the way he plays and doesn't try to be someone different." White made his ODI debut during the Super Series a year after missing a first Test cap when Nathan Hauritz was preferred in India. The retirement of Brad Hogg in early 2008 opened up an ODI spin position and White was given the first chance to secure the role. He even won a call-up to the Test squad in India when Victoria's first-choice leggie Bryce McGain went down with a shoulder injury. Despite his discomfort at being the No. 1 spinner, he held firm on debut while facing the best players of slow bowling in the business. As the series wore on it became clear he was not the answer to Australia's troubles and after four matches he was shifted aside with five wickets and 146 runs. It was time to try again as a batsman.
A clean striker of the ball who plundered ten centuries in two seasons of county cricket in 2006 and 2007, White has at times strangely struggled to convert his good starts into first-class hundreds back home. He did score 135 in the 2008-09 Sheffield Shield final against Queensland, though, and was relieved to lift the trophy after a series of near misses. He burst to life in 2009 with his first ODI century, 105 against England in Southampton, and another century came against Pakistan at home. White disappeared from the ODI side after being part of the 2011 World Cup squad but re-emerged in the T20 outfit in 2014 ahead of the World T20 in Bangladesh. The loss of the state captaincy to Matthew Wade for 2013-14 coincided with a strong personal campaign of 675 runs at 45.00, and any future internationals will certainly be as a batsman.

Australia tour of India, 2nd Test: India v Australia at Mohali, Oct 17-21, 2008



Tendulkar becomes leading Test run-scorer October 17, 2008
'I can't be running after every record ' - Tendulkar
Cricinfo staff
Sachin speak
On the journey:
Success is a process and during that journey sometimes there are stones thrown at you and you convert them into milestones. It's a great feeling.
On how long he thinks he can keep the record:
I don't what is going to happen in future. I started as a 16-year-old, without any such targets. There might be another 16-year-old, who might not be having any targets and who knows where he is going to go.
On the pressure:
"To be honest, I was not under any pressure for this record. I knew that I have to go out and play my game. It will come at some stage. There was no burden as such. Today I decided just to watch the ball as closely as possibly."
On the sparse crowd to witness the record-breaking run:
"I did not feel anything about the poor crowd attendance. It's about quality not quantity. I got a fantastic reception in a pleasing moment. I appreciate it every applaud whichever came in my way I take it wholeheartedly."
On the missing World Cup:
"That is something I would like to have. We were close to it in 2003. It was so close yet so far. I'm not looking that far ahead [2011]. I just want go out and enjoy myself and my game and not think of any targets. If it there is in the vicinity I will focus on it. Right now I want to enjoy myself."
On getting there in Mohali:
"I always wanted to do it in front of the home crowd and I'm quite happy that an Indian has achieved that record. It is not my record, it is India's record. I'm happy it has been done here."
On his family not being there at the ground:
"It is not my family style to go over at the top. I know they will be extremely happy."
It was about 15 minutes into Sachin Tendulkar's press conference. He had answered wide-ranging questions, not all pertaining to the match or his record. Before the next question came his way, the media coordinator asked him if he would like to continue. Tendulkar moved away from the mike, and although he could not be heard, it seemed he said something to the effect of "Why not?" The press conference continued for the next 11 minutes, way longer than the ones at the end of a day's play.
Tendulkar was in that kind of mood. He looked animated, spoke in three languages - English, Hindi and Marathi - and looked relieved and happy, and was subtly funny. He started off by admitting that although the record was not a big distraction, the anticipation around it did mean something. "During all the talk about the record, I concentrated on how to score runs for the team, but everybody I used to meet would talk about only one thing. Now that it is done, I know I wouldn't be asked the same question again and again."
On a personal level, he doesn't have a "what next" now? "I started as a 16-year-old, and there was no targets then," he said. "I just wanted to go enjoy every moment. That is what I like to continue with - not to think of too many things and complicate my game in the process.
"I have not played for records. I can't be running after every record [answering a query about breaking Brian Lara's 400]. I would be looking after what the team needs. The team obviously needs it. If it comes my way, I will take it. If it doesn't come, there will be no regrets."
Despite that attitude there must have been moments when he would have realised he could end up the leading run-getter in both Tests and ODIs. "As the career progresses, there is sub-consciousness mind starts thinking about it," he said. "You know that people start talking about it the records. That is how you are aware of all these things.
"There have been occasions that I didn't know how many runs I needed [to get to the record]. A couple of team-mates did not believe. I was willing to swear on anyone that I don't know. That is when they believed. The beauty is just to go out and play, and while doing that the records were meant to be broken and various milestones achieved."
What was he thinking when it happened? The steer towards the third-man boundary that got him past Brian Lara? "When I looked up, obviously I had two thoughts in my mind," he said. "One was I thanked the almighty and the second, I thanked my father. Today I miss him. He would definitely be a proud man, and I just thought of him."
Sourav Ganguly was a special partner to have when the record happened. He reminded Tendulkar of the fact that he was his partner when Tendulkar got his 35th century. "If you can remember that in the middle of all that ..."
He also dedicated the record to Ramakant Achrekar, his childhood coach, his family who have been by his side "whether or not he did well", and especially "my mother".
Almost in paternal manner, he subtly put his critics in their place. "I don't need to prove anything to anyone," he said. "I have been around for 19 years, and those 19 years I did not play cricket to prove anything to anyone, whether it was first year of my cricket or 10th, or 15th, or 19th.
"I'm not here to answer to what x, y and z is writing or saying about me. It is their opinions, and I don't  take all those opinions seriously ... But sometimes I don't know how they can figure out what's going on in my mind when sometimes I myself can't figure that out."
That was the only time he sounded mildly sour, but only mildly. The talk eventually went back to the celebration when he got the record. "The duration [of the fireworks] was bit worrying." When a journalist informed him they had planned 11,954 crackers, he said, "Eventually I figured out it was 11,954 crackers or something like that."

For more details on this topic, see History of the England cricket team to 1939 and History of the England cricket team from 1945 .
The first England team to tour Southern Australia
The first recorded incidence of a team with a claim to represent England comes from 9 July 1739 when an "All-England" team, which consisted of 11 gentlemen from any part of England exclusive of Kent , played against "the Unconquerable County" of Kent and lost by a margin of "very few notches". [8] Such matches were repeated on numerous occasions for the best part of a century.
In 1846 William Clarke formed the All-England Eleven . This team would eventually compete against a United All-England Eleven with annual matches occurring between 1847 to 1856. These matches were arguably the most important contest of the English season, if judged by the quality of the players.
Early tours[ edit ]
The first overseas tour occurred in September 1859 with England touring North America. This team had six players from the All-England Eleven, six from the United All-England Eleven and was captained by George Parr .
With the outbreak of the American Civil War , attention turned elsewhere. English tourists visited Australia in 1861-62 with this first tour organised as a commercial venture by Messrs Spiers and Pond, restaurateurs of Melbourne . Most matches played during tours prior to 1877 were "against odds", with the opposing team fielding more than 11 players to make for a more even contest. [9] This first Australian tour were mostly against odds of at least 18/11.
The tour was so successful that George Parr led a second tour in 1863–64 . James Lillywhite led a subsequent England team which sailed on the P&O steamship Poonah on 21 September 1876. They would play a combined Australian XI, for once on even terms of 11 a side. The match, starting on 15 March 1877 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground came to be regarded as the inaugural Test match. The combined Australian XI won this Test match by 45 runs with Charles Bannerman of Australia scoring the first Test century. At the time, the match was promoted as James Lillywhite's XI v Combined Victoria and New South Wales. [9] The teams played a return match on the same ground at Easter, 1877, when Lillywhite's team avenged their loss with a victory by four wickets. The first Test match on English soil occurred in 1880 with England victorious; this was the first time England fielded a fully representative side with W.G. Grace included in the team. [10]
The Ashes[ edit ]
England lost their first home series 1–0 in 1882 with The Sporting Times printing an obituary on English cricket:
“
In Affectionate Remembrance of ENGLISH CRICKET, which died at the Oval on 29th AUGUST 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances R.I.P. N.B. – The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia. [11]
”
As a result of this loss the tour of 1882–83 was dubbed by England captain Ivo Bligh as "the quest to regain the ashes". England with a mixture of amateurs and professionals won the series 2–1. [12] Bligh was presented with an urn that contained some ashes, which have variously been said to be of a bail , ball or even a woman's veil and so The Ashes was born. A fourth match was then played which Australia won by 4 wickets but the match was not considered part of the Ashes series. [12] [13] England would dominate many of these early contests with England winning the Ashes series 10 times between 1884 and 1898. [14] During this period England also played their first Test match against South Africa in 1889 at Port Elizabeth . [15]
The 1899 Ashes series was the first tour where the MCC and the counties appointed a selection committee. There were three active players: Lord Hawke , W. G. Grace and Herbert Bainbridge who was the captain of Warwickshire. Prior to this, England teams for home Tests had been chosen by the club on whose ground the match was to be played.
The start of the 20th century saw mixed results for England as they lost four of the eight Ashes series between 1900 and 1914. [16] During this period England would lose their first series against South Africa in the 1905–06 season 4–1 as their batting faltered. [17] The 1912 season saw England take part in a unique experiment. A nine Test triangular tournament involving England, South Africa and Australia was set up. The series was hampered by a very wet summer and player disputes however and the tournament was considered a failure with the Daily Telegraph stating: [18]
“
Nine Tests provide a surfeit of cricket, and contests between Australia and South Africa are not a great attraction to the British public.
”
With Australia sending a weakened team and the South African bowlers being ineffective England dominated the tournament winning four of their six matches. The Australia v South Africa match, at Lord's, was notable for a visit by King George V , the first time a reigning monarch had watched Test cricket. [19] England would go on one more tour against South Africa before the outbreak of World War I.
Inter-war period[ edit ]
England's first match after the war was in the 1920–21 season against Australia. Still feeling the effects of the war England went down to a series of crushing defeats, and suffered their first whitewash losing the series 5–0. Six Australians scored hundreds while Mailey spun out 36 English batsmen. Things were no better in the next few Ashes series losing the 1921 Ashes series 3–0 and the 1924–5 Ashes 4–1. England's fortunes were to change in 1926 as they regained the Ashes and were a formidable team during this period dispatching Australia 4–1 in the 1928–29 Ashes tour.
On the same year the West Indies became the fourth nation to be granted Test status and played their first game against England. England won each of these three Tests by an innings, and a view was expressed in the press that their elevation had proved a mistake although Learie Constantine did the double on the tour. In the 1929–30 season England went on two concurrent tours with one team going to New Zealand (who were granted Test status earlier that year) and the other to the West Indies. Despite sending two separate teams England won both tours beating New Zealand 1–0 and the West Indies 2–1.
Bill Woodfull evades a Bodyline ball. Note the number of leg-side fielders.
The 1930 Ashes series saw a young Don Bradman dominate the tour, scoring 974 runs in his seven Test innings. He scored 254 at Lord's, 334 at Headingley and 232 at the Oval. Australia regained the Ashes winning the series 3–1. As a result of Bradman's prolific run-scoring the England captain Douglas Jardine chose to develop the already existing leg theory into fast leg theory, or bodyline, as a tactic to stop Bradman. Fast leg theory involved bowling fast balls directly at the batsman's body. The batsman would need to defend himself, and if he touched the ball with the bat, he risked being caught by one of a large number of fielders placed on the leg side.
English cricket team at the Test match held at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground . England won the match by a record margin of 675 runs.
Using his fast leg theory England won the next Ashes series 4–1. But complaints about the Bodyline tactic caused crowd disruption on the tour, and threats of diplomatic action from the Australian Cricket Board , which during the tour sent the following cable to the MCC in London:
“
Bodyline bowling assumed such proportions as to menace best interests of game, making protection of body by batsmen the main consideration. Causing intensely bitter feeling between players as well as injury. In our opinion is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once likely to upset friendly relations existing between Australia and England.
”
Later, Jardine was removed from the captaincy and the laws of cricket changed so that no more than one fast ball aimed at the body was permitted per over, and having more than two fielders behind square leg were banned.
England's following tour of India in the 1933–34 season was the first Test match to be staged in the subcontinent. The series was also notable for Morris Nichols and Nobby Clark bowling so many bouncers that the Indian batsman wore solar topees instead of caps to protect themselves.
Australia won the 1934 Ashes series 2–1 and would keep the urn for the following 19 years. Many of the wickets of the time were friendly to batsmen resulting in a large proportion of matches ending in high scoring draws and many batting records being set.
The 1938–39 tour of South Africa saw another experiment with the deciding Test being a timeless Test that was played to a finish. England lead 1–0 going into the final timeless match at Durban. Despite the final Test being 'timeless', the game ended in a draw after 10 days as England had to catch the train to catch the boat home. A record 1,981 runs were scored, and the concept of timeless Tests was abandoned. England would go in one final tour of the West Indies in 1939 before World War II , although a team for an MCC tour of India was selected more in hope than expectation of the matches being played.
Post-war period[ edit ]
After World War II, England fell under difficult times suffering a heavy defeat 3–0 to Australia. This was followed by a 4–0 loss to Bradman's 'invincibles' and a stunning 2–0 loss to the West Indies. These loses were tempered by victories against India and South Africa.
Their fortunes would change in the 1953 Ashes tour as they won the series 1–0. England would not lose a series between their 1950–51 and 1958–59 tours of Australia and secured famous victory in 1954–55 thanks to Typhoon Tyson whose 6–85 at Sydney and 7–27 at Melbourne are remembered as the fastest bowling ever seen in Australia. The 1956 series was remembered for the bowling of Jim Laker who took 46 wickets at 9.62 which included bowling figures of 19/90 at Old Trafford . After drawing to South Africa, England defeated the West Indies and New Zealand comfortably. The England team would then leave for Australia in the 1958–59 season with a team that had been hailed as the strongest ever to leave on an Ashes tour but lost the series 4–0 as Richie Benaud 's revitalised Australians were too strong.
The early and middle 1960s were poor periods for English cricket. Despite England's strength on paper, Australia held the Ashes and the West Indies dominated England in the early part of the decade. However, from 1968 to 1971 they played 27 consecutive Test matches without defeat, winning 9 and drawing 18 (including the abandoned Test at Melbourne in 1970–71). The sequence began when they drew with Australia at Lords in the Second Test of the 1968 Ashes series and ended in 1971 when India won the Third Test at the Oval by 4 wickets. They played 13 Tests with only one defeat immediately beforehand and so played a total of 40 consecutive Tests with only one defeat, dating from their innings victory over the West Indies at The Oval in 1966. During this period they beat New Zealand, India, the West Indies, Pakistan and, under Ray Illingworth 's determined leadership, regained The Ashes from Australia in 1970–71.
1971 to 2000[ edit ]
The 1970s, for the England team, can be largely split into three parts. The early 70s saw Ray Illingworth 's side dominate world cricket winning the Ashes away in 1971 and then retaining them at home in 1972. The same side beat Pakistan at home in 1971 and played by far the better cricket against India that season. However, England were largely helped by the rain to sneak the Pakistan series 1–0 but the same rain saved India twice and one England collapse saw them lose to India. This was, however, one of (if not the) strongest England team ever with Boycott, Edrich, D'Oliveira, Amiss, Illingworth, Knott, Snow, Underwood amongst its core.
The mid-1970s were more turbulent. Illingworth and several others had refused to tour India in 1972–73 which led to a clamour for Illingworth's job by the end of that summer – England had just been thrashed 2–0 by a flamboyant West Indies side – with several England players well over 35. Mike Denness was the surprising choice but only lasted 18 months; his results against poor opposition were good but England were badly exposed as ageing and lacking in good fast bowling against the 1974–75 Australians, losing that series 4–1 to lose the Ashes.
Denness was replaced in 1975 by Tony Greig . While he managed to avoid losing to Australia, his side were largely thrashed the following year by the young and very much upcoming West Indies for whom Greig's infamous "grovel" remark acted as motivation. Greig's finest hour was probably the 1976–77 win over India in India. When Greig was discovered as being instrumental in World Series Cricket, he was sacked, and replaced by Mike Brearley .
Brearley's side showed again the hyperbole that is often spoken when one side dominates in cricket. While his side of 1977–80 contained some young players who went on to become England greats, most notably future captains Ian Botham , David Gower and Graham Gooch , their opponents were often very much weakened by the absence of their World Series players, especially in 1978, when England beat New Zealand 3–0 and Pakistan 2–0 before thrashing what was probably Australia's 3rd XI 5–1 in 1978–79.
The England team, with Brearley's exit in 1980, was never truly settled throughout the 1980s, which will probably be remembered as a low point for the team. While some of the great players like Botham, Gooch and Gower had fine careers, the team seldom succeeded in beating good opposition throughout the decade and did not score a home Test victory (except against minnows Sri Lanka) between September 1985 and July 1990. In this time, undoubted highlights were the Ashes victories of 1981 "Botham's Ashes", 1985 and 1986–87. The 1985 and 1986–87 victories, while sweet for the team, exposed more Australia's weakness than England's strength.
If the 1980s were a low point for English Test cricket then the 1990s were only a slight improvement. The arrival of Graham Gooch as captain in 1990 forced a move toward more professionalism and especially fitness, though it took some time for old habits to die. Even in 2011, one or two successful county players have been shown up as physically unfit for international cricket. Creditable performances against India and New Zealand in 1990 were followed by a hard fought draw against the 1991 West Indies but landmark losses against Australia in 1990–91 and especially Pakistan in 1992 showed England up badly in terms of bowling. So bad was England's bowling in 1993 that Rodney Marsh described England's pace attack at one point as "pie throwers". Having lost three of the first four Tests played in England in 1993 Graham Gooch resigned to be replaced by Mike Atherton .
More selectorial problems abounded during Atherton's reign as new chairman of selectors / coach Ray Illingworth (then into his 60s) assumed almost sole responsibility for the team off the field. The youth policy which had seen England emerge from the West Indies tour of 1993–94 with some credit (though losing to a seasoned WIndies team) was abandoned and players such as Gatting and Gooch were persisted with when well into their 30s and 40s. England duly continued to do well at home against weaker opponents such as India, New Zealand and a West Indies side beginning to fade but struggled badly against improving sides like Pakistan and South Africa. Atherton had offered his resignation after losing the 1997 Ashes series 3–2 having been 1–0 up after 2 matches – eventually to resign one series later in early 1998. England, looking for talent, went through a whole raft of new players during this period, such as Ronnie Irani , Adam Hollioake , Craig White , Graeme Hick , Mark Ramprakash . At this time, there were two main problems:
The lack of a genuine all-rounder to bat at 6, Ian Botham having left a huge gap in the batting order when he had retired from Tests in 1992.
Alec Stewart , a sound wicket-keeper and an excellent player of quick bowling, could not open and keep wicket, hence his batting down the order, where he was often exposed to spin which he didn't play as well.
Alec Stewart took the reins as captain in 1998 but another losing Ashes series and early World Cup exit cost him Test and ODI captaincy in 1999. This should not detract from the 1998 home Test series where England showed great fortitude to beat a powerful South African side 2–1.
Another reason for their poor performances were the demands of County Cricket teams on their players, meaning that England could rarely field a full strength team on their tours. This would eventually lead to the ECB taking over the MCC as the governing body of England and the implementation of central contracts. 1992 also saw Scotland sever ties with the England and Wales team, and begin to compete independently as the Scotland national cricket team .
By 1999, with coach David Lloyd resigning after the World Cup exit and new captain Nasser Hussain just appointed, England hit rock bottom (literally ranked as lowest-rated Test nation) after losing in shambolic fashion to New Zealand 2–1. Hussain was booed on the Oval balcony as the crowd jeered "We've got the worst team in the world" to the tune of " He's Got the Whole World in His Hands ".
2000 to 2010[ edit ]
One year later, with central contracts now installed reducing players workloads and the arrival of Zimbabwean coach Duncan Fletcher , England had thrashed the fallen West Indies 3–1 . England's results in Asia improved markedly that winter with series wins against both Pakistan and Sri Lanka though one-day success still eluded them.
England's fortunes improved under the new management – not without the occasional "blip" particularly against Australia but home Test wins became commonplace. Hussain's side had a far harder edge to it, even managing to avoid the anticipated "Greenwash" in the 2001 Ashes series against the all-powerful Australian team. The nucleus of a side of fighters was slowly coming together as players such as Hussain himself, Graham Thorpe , Darren Gough and Ashley Giles began to be regularly selected. By 2003 though, having endured another Ashes drubbing as well as another first-round exit from the World Cup , Hussain felt he could not continue and resigned after one Test against South Africa , though carried on as a batsman until 2004.
Michael Vaughan took over and, while keeping the emphasis as Hussain on fitness and control, encouraged players to express themselves. This especially brought the best out of Andrew Flintoff who, in a career blighted by serious injury managed a real purple patch of 18 months from 2004 to 2005 in which England won five consecutive test series prior to facing Australia in the 2005 Ashes series , taking the team to second place in the ICC Test Championship table. During this period England defeated the West Indies home and away , New Zealand , and Bangladesh at home, and South Africa in South Africa.
In June 2005, England played its first ever T20 international match , defeating Australia by 100 runs .
Later that year, England defeated Australia 2–1 in a thrilling series to regain the Ashes for the first time in 16 years having lost them in 1989. Following the 2005 Ashes win, the team suffered from a spate of serious injuries to key players such as Vaughan, Flintoff, Giles and Simon Jones . As a result, the team underwent an enforced period of transition. A 2–0 defeat in Pakistan was followed by two drawn away series with India and Sri Lanka .
In the home Test series victory against Pakistan in July and August 2006, several promising new players emerged. Most notable were the left-arm orthodox spin bowler Monty Panesar , the first Sikh to play Test cricket for England; and left-handed opening batsman Alastair Cook . Meanwhile, England's injury problems allowed previously marginal Test players such as Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell to consolidate their places in the team.
The 2006–07 Ashes series was keenly anticipated and was expected to provide a level of competition comparable to the 2005 series. In the event, England, captained by Flintoff who was deputising for the injured Vaughan, lost all five Tests to concede the first Ashes whitewash in 86 years.
England's form in ODIs had been consistently poor. They only narrowly avoided the ignominy of having to play in the qualifying rounds of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy . Despite this, in the ODI triangular in Australia, England recorded its first ODI tournament win overseas since 1997. But, in the 2007 Cricket World Cup , England lost to most of the Test playing nations they faced, beating only the West Indies and Bangladesh , although they also avoided defeat by any of the non-Test playing nations. Even so, the unimpressive nature of most of their victories in the tournament, combined with heavy defeats by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, left many commentators criticising the manner in which the England team approached the one-day game. Coach Duncan Fletcher resigned after eight years in the job as a result and was succeeded by former Sussex coach Peter Moores .
Afterwards, England's Test record was indifferent and the team slumped to fifth in the ICC rankings. There was a convincing 3–0 Test series win over West Indies in 2007 but it was followed in the second half of the summer by a 1–0 loss to India , although England did defeat India 4–3 in the ODI series .
In 2007–08, England toured Sri Lanka and New Zealand , losing the first series 1–0 and winning the second 2–1. They followed up at home in May 2008 with a 2–0 home series win against New Zealand , these results easing the pressure on Moores, who was not at ease with his team, particularly star batsman Kevin Pietersen , who succeeded Vaughan as captain in June 2008, after England had been well beaten by South Africa at home .
The poor relationship between Moores and Pietersen came to a head in India on the 2008–09 tour . England lost the series 1–0 and both men resigned their positions, although Pietersen remained a member of the England team. Moores was replaced as coach by Zimbabwean Andy Flower . Against this background, England toured the West Indies under the captaincy of Andrew Strauss and, in a disappointing performance, lost the Test series 1–0.
The second Twenty20 World Cup was held in England in 2009 but England suffered an opening day defeat to the Netherlands. They recovered to defeat both eventual champions Paxt half hour; today, he went for the next delivery and failed to connect properly. Three overs later he went to cut another wide one, which was marginally too full, and chopped it onto his stumps.
At this point Australia had taken three wickets, only one of them earned. A fourth followed, amid the frenzy around Tendulkar, but Mitchell Johnson should consider himself lucky to dismiss a quality batsman like VVS Laxman with a leg-side ball that didn't deserve a wicket. Suddenly India had lost three wickets for 13 runs and were in danger of getting bowled out for a below-par total on a good batting track.
Thankfully for India Tendulkar, once he'd acquired Lara's record, batted with fluency. There was nothing circumspect about the way he played after tea. Ganguly took the initiative, but it was Tendulkar who showed Australia how hopelessly unhelpful the pitch was on the first day. There was no discrimination: no bowler nor shot escaped Tendulkar. Ganguly, in distinct patches of quietness and aggressive intent, was solid throughout. The difference in India's approach after tea was clear: the first time Tendulkar faced the new ball he deposited it to the cover boundary.
Australia were reduced to being honest witnesses who relied on the batsmen's mercies and mistakes. And a mistake is what they drew from Tendulkar towards the end of the play. As a result, while they didn't have any say in the way the game progressed, they ended the day pretty much even. India need a big partnership tomorrow morning to take a clear advantage. And tomorrow, there won't be as many distractions from Test cricket.

ODI # 3642
Profile
Modern Australian wicketkeepers are renowned for being tough and uncompromising, and Brad Haddin was a fitting inheritor of the job held by the likes of Rod Marsh and Ian Healy. His immediate predecessor was Adam Gilchrist, whose presence prevented Haddin from making his Test debut until the age of 30. However, Haddin made up for lost time by eventually becoming vice-captain to Michael Clarke and a key senior figure in a developing side. Never was he more important than in during the 2013-14 Ashes clean-sweep, when he bailed Australia out of tricky positions in every first innings of the campaign. His 493 runs at 61.62 put him second only to David Warner on the run tally and he was nimble behind the stumps, and it was only Mitchell Johnson's reign of terror that prevented Haddin being Player of the Series.
By 2014, he was again Australia's preferred keeper in all three formats after two years earlier being usurped by Matthew Wade in all three. Haddin had originally lost his Test spot to Wade after flying home from the 2012 West Indies tour when his 17-month-old daughter Mia was diagnosed with cancer. At 34, it seemed as though his international career might be over, but Haddin showed his dedication by returning to domestic cricket and winning back his place for the 2013 Ashes tour, when Australia's selectors wanted his experience and poise. Renowned as a loyal team man who could be brusque with the media, Haddin was a valuable lieutenant and sounding board for Clarke during the back-to-back Ashes series.
Haddin's first taste of Test cricket had come in the West Indies in 2008, when he played through the pain of a broken finger. Flaws in his keeping were on show in India in 2008 but his glovework gradually improved, and a batting breakthrough in 2008-09 gave him confidence. In his 16th Test innings he passed 50 for the first time and went on to 169 against New Zealand in Adelaide, showing flashes Gilchrist would have accepted. An important one-day batsman who shuffled around the order, Haddin also had the chance to captain Australia in T20s in 2009 when Ricky Ponting, Clarke and Michael Hussey were rested. He was also starting to prove himself a productive Test run-maker, which continued on the 2009 Ashes tour with 121 in Cardiff and 80 at Lord's, where he also gave up 20 byes as he struggled to deal with the late movement. A broken finger gave Graham Manou an opening at Edgbaston, but Haddin returned for the final two Tests.
He remained a useful batting contributor in 2009-10 but his highlight was the spectacular, one-handed take at full stretch down the legside off Salman Butt. It was a hugely impressive catch that helped Australia to an unbelievable win at the SCG in 2009-10. (New Zealand supporters find it hard to forget the glove-assisted bowled of Neil Broom in a one-day game the previous summer.) Another injury, a batting-related elbow problem, rubbed him out of the Pakistan series in England, where Tim Paine was used, and after 136 in the opening Ashes Test of 2010-11, Haddin endured a more difficult period in 2011. Notably, he was one of the major culprits in Australia's 47 all out in Cape Town, when at 18 for 5 he backed away and tried to drive Vernon Philander on the up through the off side, gifting South Africa a sixth wicket. A lean home series against India followed, before Wade took his place in the West Indies.
A valuable presence in the limited-overs sides, Haddin has scored ODI centuries opening the batting. He is a clean, effortless hitter and his lofted straight drive is among the best shots in the game. He made his ODI debut in 2001 but had to see off the likes of Darren Berry, Wade Seccombe and Ryan Campbell to become keeper-in-waiting behind Gilchrist. A former Australia Under-19 captain who grew up in Gundagai, Haddin began his domestic career in 1997-98 with the ACT Comets in their debut Mercantile Mutual Cup season. Two years later he was playing for New South Wales, and played in their successful Pura Cup/Sheffield Shield finals of 2002-03 and 2007-08, and captained them to the title in 2004-05.

Stuart Broad, caught down the leg side, was his final victim, in a spell of 5 for 41 in eight overs, broken by lunch. His use of the short ball was encouraged by his captain, MS Dhoni, and began as a last throw of the dice 10 minutes before lunch, a response to a draining morning in which India had failed to disturb the equanimity of Root and Moeen. From that moment, India never looked back as, bowling from a great height, he exploited occasional indifferent bounce. This was the Ishant of India's dreams - but for those who cared to look deeply enough, it was England assisted.
The ending, in India's eyes, was pure Bollywood. Ravindra Jadeja ran out his adversary, James Anderson. Then he offered a handshake which Anderson felt obliged to accept. Tomorrow, they are pitted against each other again in an ICC enquiry into the off-field brouhaha between them in the Trent Bridge Test.
Ishant's bohemian side was captured by the occasional appearance of non-cricket coloured purple pants as he tore in to bowl, East Perth replaced six years on by St John's Wood. England's innings ended in the 89th over, but the new ball was never even taken.
That these are two middle-ranking teams with problems is undeniable, but their inadequacies as much as their promise had contributed to an engrossing spectacle on a Lord's pitch of uplifting quality.  India can celebrate in London before heading to the Ageas Bowl for a third Test beginning on Sunday; England face recriminations, with the Test future of their wicketkeeper, Matt Prior, also bound to be under scrutiny.
India went unrewarded until the final ball of a morning session in which Root and Moeen played with skill and fortitude. Then Ishant summoned a wicked bouncer to have Moeen caught at short leg. One wicket, but potentially a huge psychological shift. There was no skill and fortitude after that, not from England anyway.
Without that wicket, England could have taken enormous satisfaction from a morning which had chipped away 68 of the 214 runs they still needed. India's dressing room morale would have been shaken. But the ball reared aggressively enough for Moeen to tilt his head away in self-protection and a simple catch flew off the glove to Cheteshwar Pujara at short leg. India, it turned out, had found a way to succeed.

Root seemed to have ensured that England went to lunch as buoyant as possible. Ishant had been brought back to hunt a wicket that India were desperately in need of but 14 came off the over. Root struck three boundaries in that first over back, passing his half-century on the way.  He moved through the offside arc - straight, covers, backward point. With England 170 for 4, an unlikely victory 149 runs away, it was India's lowest point.
From 72 for 4, Root and Moeen had assembled a fifth-wicket stand of 101 in 44 overs, Root relishing the tension, Moeen composed alongside him, vulnerable occasionally against Ravindra Jadeja's left-arm spin as a couple of nudges dropped safely away from the leg trap.
There had only been one successful chase at Lord's beyond 319 and only 27 successful chases of 300 or above in Test history. But sides bat deeper these days and, although a wonderful Lord's pitch was now offering substantial turn, India only had one (fairly) specialist spinner in Jadeja. The choice of Stuart Binny's medium pace above the spin of R Ashwin was hard to justify.
Such debates were silenced by Ishant. With the new ball only four overs away as he began his innings after lunch, Prior might have been expected to try to hang around with Root, so protecting a young talent like Stokes from the new ball. Instead, he chose aggression, eager to make progress against the short stuff. With the new ball theoretically only two balls away, Prior hooked Ishant to deep midwicket with three men laid out for the trap.
Stokes, out in Ishant's next over, collected a pair, failing to pull him up the slope and skying to Pujara at midwicket. His run of England failures is so long it is now a phone number in the UAE according to fans there. At least Root's swivel pull later in the over had an element of control, but he picked out deep square all the same.  Root had imagined he might plot a route to victory. Instead Root 66 turned out to be a road to oblivion.
India's only other win at Lord's came in 1986. David Gower, a captain under pressure, had just followed up a home Ashes victory with a heavy defeat the following winter. He was replaced by Mike Gatting as captain after India won at Lord's. It was easy to advance a theory, perhaps fanciful given England's protestations of loyalty, that Cook might go the same way. But at his post-match press conference he insisted that he had no intention of resigning.

Bibliographic details for "Padmanabhan Prasanth"
Page name: Padmanabhan Prasanth
Publisher: Wikipedia, Thel independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted English and later British governance and was the only Caribbean island that did not change hands during the colonial period. In the very early years, the majority of the population was white and male, with African slaves providing little of the workforce. Cultivation of tobacco, cotton, ginger and indigo was handled primarily by European indentured labour until the start of the sugar cane industry in the 1640s. As Barbados' economy grew, Barbados developed a large measure of local autonomy through its founding as a proprietary colony . Its House of Assembly began meeting in 1639. Among the island's earliest leading figures was the Anglo-Dutch Sir William Courten .
The 1780 hurricane killed over 4,000 people on Barbados. In 1854, a cholera epidemic killed over 20,000 inhabitants. [27] At emancipation in 1833, the size of the slave population was approximately 83,000. Between 1946 and 1980, Barbados' rate of population growth was diminished by one-third because of emigration to Britain. [28]
Geography and climate[ edit ]
Main article: Geography of Barbados
A map of Barbados
Barbados is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, east of the other West Indies Islands. Barbados is the easternmost island in the Lesser Antilles . It is flat in comparison to its island neighbours to the west, the Windward Islands . The island rises gently to the central highland region, with the high point of the nation being Mount Hillaby in the geological Scotland District 340 metres (1,120 ft) above sea level.
In the parish of Saint Michael lies Barbados' capital and main city, Bridgetown . Other major towns scattered across the island include Holetown , in the parish of Saint James ; Oistins , in the parish of Christ Church ; and Speightstown , in the parish of Saint Peter .
Geology[ edit ]
Barbados lies on the boundary of the South American and the Caribbean Plates . [29] The subduction of the South American plate beneath the Caribbean plate scrapes sediment from the South American plate and deposits it above the subduction zone forming an accretionary prism . The rate of this depositing of material allows Barbados to rise at a rate of about 25 millimetres (0.98 in) per 1,000 years. [30] This subduction means geologically the island is composed of coral roughly (90 m or 300 ft thick), where reefs formed above the sediment. The land slopes in a series of "terraces" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. A large proportion of the island is circled by coral reefs .
The erosion of limestone rock in the North East of the island, in the Scotland District, has resulted in the formation of various caves and gullies , some of which have become popular tourist attractions such as Harrison's Cave and Welchman Hall Gully. On the Atlantic East coast of the island coastal landforms , including stacks, have been created due to the limestone composition of the area.
Climate[ edit ]
Bathsheba on the east coast of the island.
The country generally experiences two seasons, one of which includes noticeably higher rainfall. Known as the " wet season ", this period runs from June to November. By contrast, the " dry season " runs from December to May. Annual precipitation ranges between 40 and 90 inches (1,000 and 2,300 mm). From December to May the average temperatures range from 21 to 31 °C (70 to 88 °F), while between June and November, they range from 23 to 31 °C (73 to 88 °F). [31]
On the Köppen climate classification scale, much of Barbados is regarded as a tropical monsoon climate (Am). However, gentle breezes of 12–16 kilometres per hour (8–10 mph) abound throughout the year and give Barbados a climate which is moderately tropical.
Infrequent natural hazards include earthquakes, landslips and hurricanes . Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical storms and hurricanes during the rainy season. Its location in the south-east of the Caribbean region puts the country just outside the principal hurricane strike zone . On average, a major hurricane strikes about once every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was Hurricane Janet in 1955; in 2010 the island was struck by Hurricane Tomas , but this caused only minor damage across the country. [32]

Barbados is susceptible to environmental pressures. As one of the world's most densely populated isles , the government worked during the 1990s [33] to aggressively integrate the growing south coast of the island into the Bridgetown Sewage Treatment Plant to reduce contamination of offshore coral reefs. [34] [35] As of the first decade of the 21st century, a second treatment plant has been proposed along the islands' west coast. Being so densely populated, Barbados has made great efforts to protect its underground aquifers . [36]
As a coral-limestone island, Barbados is highly permeable to seepage of surface water into the earth. The government has placed great emphasis on protecting the catchment areas that lead directly into the huge network of underground aquifers and streams. [36] On occasion illegal squatters have breached these areas, and the government has removed squatters to preserve the cleanliness of the underground springs which provide the island's drinking water. [37]
The government has placed a huge emphasis on keeping Barbados clean with the aim of protecting the environment and preserving offshore coral reefs which surround the island. Many initiatives to mitigate human pressures on the coastal regions of Barbados and seas come from the Coastal Zone Management Unit (CZMU) . [38] Barbados has nearly 90 km of coral reefs just offshore and two protected marine parks have been established off the west coast. [39] Overfishing is another threat which faces Barbados. [40]
Barbados is host to four species of nesting turtles ( green turtles , loggerheads , hawksbill turtles , and leatherbacks ) and has the second-largest hawksbill turtle breeding population in the Caribbean. [41] The driving of vehicles on beaches can crush nests buried in the sand and such activity should be avoided in nesting areas. [42]
Though on the opposite side of the Atlantic, and some 4800 km west of Africa, Barbados is one of many places in the American continent that experiences heightened levels of mineral dust from the Sahara Desert . [43] Some particularly intense dust episodes have been blamed partly for the impacts on the health of coral reefs [44] surrounding Barbados or asthmatic episodes, [45] but evidence has not wholly supported the former such claim. [46]
Government and politics[ edit ]



Main article: Religion in New Zealand
Christianity is the predominant religion in New Zealand, although its society is among the most secular in the world. [270] In the 2013 Census, 55.0 percent of the population identified with one or more religions, including 49.0 percent identifying as Christians. Another 41.9 percent indicated that they had no religion. [n 11] [271] The main Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism (12.6 percent), Anglicanism (11.8 percent), Presbyterianism (8.5 percent) and "Christian not further defined" (i.e. people identifying as Christian but not stating the denomination, 5.5 percent). [271] The Māori-based Ringatū and Rātana religions (1.4 percent) are also Christian. [272] Other significant minority religions include Hinduism (2.3 percent), Buddhism (1.5 percent) and Islam (1.2 percent). The indigenous Māori Christians tend to be associated with the Anglican and Catholic churches, while Pacific people tend to be Presbyterian, Methodist, Catholic and Latter-day Saint adherents. [271]
Culture
Main article: Culture of New Zealand
Late twentieth-century house-post depicting the navigator Kupe fighting two sea creatures
Early Māori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whanau), sub-tribes (hapu) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira) whose position was subject to the community's approval. [273] The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture, [274] [275] particularly with the introduction of Christianity. [276] However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity , and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples . [277] More recently American , Australian , Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika , the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.

The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders being rugged, industrious problem solvers. [278] Modesty was expected and enforced through the " tall poppy syndrome ", where high achievers received harsh criticism. [279] At the time New Zealand was not known as an intellectual country. [280] From the early 20th century until the late 1960s Māori culture was suppressed by the attempted assimilation of Māori into British New Zealanders. [257] In the 1960s, as higher education became more available and cities expanded [281] urban culture began to dominate. [282] Even though the majority of the population now lives in cities, much of New Zealand's art, literature, film and humour has rural themes.
Art
Main article: New Zealand art
As part of the resurgence of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. [283] Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. [284] Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. [285] The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses ( wharenui ) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs. [286]
Māori decorated the white wood of buildings, canoes and cenotaphs using red (a mixture of red ochre and shark fat) and black (made from soot) paint and painted pictures of birds, reptiles and other designs on cave walls. [287] Māori tattoos ( moko ) consisting of coloured soot mixed with gum were cut into the flesh with a bone chisel. [288] Since European arrival paintings and photographs have been dominated by landscapes, originally not as works of art but as factual portrayals of New Zealand. [289] Portraits of Māori were also common, with early painters often portraying them as " noble savages ", exotic beauties or friendly natives. [289] The country's isolation delayed the influence of European artistic trends allowing local artists to developed their own distinctive style of regionalism . [290] During the 1960s and 70s many artists combined traditional Māori and Western techniques, creating unique art forms. [291] New Zealand art and craft has gradually achieved an international audience, with exhibitions in the Venice Biennale in 2001 and the "Paradise Now" exhibition in New York in 2004. [283] [292]
Portrait of Hinepare of Ngāti Kahungunu by Gottfried Lindauer , showing chin moko , pounamu hei-tiki and woven cloak
Māori cloaks are made of fine flax fibre and patterned with black, red and white triangles, diamonds and other geometric shapes. [293] Greenstone was fashioned into earrings and necklaces, with the most well-known design being the hei-tiki , a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side. [294] Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand, and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions. [295] Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received a reputation for being casual, practical and lacklustre. [296] [297] However, the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000, doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels, with some labels gaining international recognition. [297]
Literature
Main article: New Zealand literature
Māori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form. [298] Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and it was not until the 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known. [299] Although still largely influenced by global trends ( modernism ) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit. [300] Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished. [301] Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature . [302]
Media and entertainment
Bungee jumping in the popular resort town of Queenstown .
New Zealand music has been influenced by blues , jazz , country , rock and roll and hip hop , with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand interpretation. [303] Māori developed traditional chants and songs from their ancient South-East Asian origins, and after centuries of isolation created a unique "monotonous" and "doleful" sound. [304] Flutes and trumpets were used as musical instruments [305] or as signalling devices during war or special occasions. [306] Early settlers brought over their ethnic music, with brass bands and choral music being popular, and musicians began touring New Zealand in the 1860s. [307] [308] Pipe bands became widespread during the early 20th century. [309] The New Zealand recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards and many New Zealand musicians have obtained success in Britain and the USA. [303] Some artists release Māori language songs and the Māori tradition-based art of kapa haka (song and dance) has made a resurgence. [310] The New Zealand Music Awards are held annually by Recorded Music NZ ; the awards were first held in 1965 by Reckitt & Colman as the Loxene Golden Disc awards. [311] Recorded Music NZ also publishes the country's official weekly record charts . [312]
Radio first arrived in New Zealand in 1922 and television in 1960. [313] The number of New Zealand films significantly increased during the 1970s. [314] In 1978 the New Zealand Film Commission started assisting local film-makers and many films attained a world audience, some receiving international acknowledgement. The highest grossing New Zealand movies [315] include: Boy , The World's Fastest Indian , Once Were Warriors , and Whale Rider . Deregulation in the 1980s saw a sudden increase in the numbers of radio and television stations. [314] New Zealand television primarily broadcasts American and British programming, along with a large number of Australian and local shows. The country's diverse scenery and compact size, plus government incentives, [316] have encouraged some producers to film big budget movies in New Zealand. [317] The New Zealand media industry is dominated by a small number of companies, most of which are foreign-owned, although the state retains ownership of some television and radio stations. Between 2003 and 2008, Reporters Without Borders consistently ranked New Zealand's press freedom in the top twenty. [318] As of 2011, New Zealand was ranked 13th worldwide in press freedom by Freedom House , with the 2nd freest media in the Asia-Pacific region after Palau . [319]
Sports

Most of the major sporting codes played in New Zealand have British origins. [320] Rugby union is considered the national sport [321] and attracts the most spectators. [322] Golf , netball , tennikistan and reigning champions India but were then knocked out by West Indies.
This was followed by the 2009 Ashes series which featured the first Test match played in Wales, at Sophia Gardens , Cardiff. England drew that match thanks to a last wicket stand by bowlers James Anderson and Monty Panesar . A victory for each team followed before the series was decided at The Oval . Thanks to fine bowling by Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann and a debut century by Jonathan Trott , England regained the Ashes.
Since 2010[ edit ]
After a drawn Test series in South Africa , England won their first ever ICC tournament, the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 . The following winter, they thrashed Australia 3–1 to retain the Ashes; it was their first series win in Australia for 24 years, and included three innings victories and 766 runs by opener Alastair Cook .
England struggled to match their Test form in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup . Despite beating South Africa and tying with eventual winners India, England suffered shock losses to Ireland and Bangladesh before losing in the quarter-finals to Sri Lanka. [20] However the team's excellent form in the Test match arena continued and they became the world's top ranked Test team after comfortably whitewashing India 4–0 , their sixth consecutive series victory and eighth in the past nine series. However, this status only lasted a year – having lost 3–0 to Pakistan over the winter, England were beaten 2–0 by South Africa , who replaced them at the top of the rankings. It was their first home series loss since 2008, against the same opposition.
This loss saw the resignation of Strauss as captain (and his retirement from cricket). His replacement, Alastair Cook, who was already in charge of the ODI side, led England to a 2–1 victory in India – their first in the country since 1984–85. In doing so, Cook became the first ever captain to score centuries in his first five Tests as captain and became England's leading century-maker with 23 hundreds.
After finishing as runners-up in the ICC Champions Trophy , England faced Australia in back-to-back Ashes series. A 3–0 home win secured England the urn for the fourth time in five series. However, in the return series , they found themselves utterly demolished in a 5–0 defeat, their second Ashes whitewash in under a decade. Their misery was compounded by batsman Jonathan Trott leaving the tour early due to a stress-related illness and the mid-series retirement of spinner Graeme Swann . Following the tour, head coach Andy Flower resigned his post whilst batsman Kevin Pietersen was dropped indefinitely from the England team. [21] Flower was replaced by his predecessor, Peter Moores, but he was sacked for a second time after a string of disappointing results including failing to advance from the group stage at the 2015 World Cup .
It was in the UAE.

Charles William Jeffrey "Bill" Athey (born 27 September 1957, Middlesbrough , Yorkshire , England ) [1] is a retired English first-class cricketer , who played for England , and first class cricket for Gloucestershire , Yorkshire [2] and Sussex ; he also played a solitary one-day game for Worcestershire . His bulldog spirit was exemplified by the Union Jack tattooed on his arm. He played in 23 Test matches between 1980 and 1988, but scored more than 50 runs only five times in 41 innings. In 1990, Athey joined the rebel tour to South Africa . [1]
Life and career[ edit ]
He made his debut for his native Yorkshire in 1976, before moving to Gloucestershire in 1984. [2] He captained the side in 1989, and scored four hundreds in successive innings while there. In 1993, he moved to Sussex, and passed the increasingly rare landmark of 25,000 first class runs when he made an unbeaten century against Somerset in 1997.
At the end of that season he joined Worcestershire as coach, having 'retired' from playing, though in spite of his status he did play several times for the Second XI and once (in 1999) in a National League game. He left New Road at the end of 2000. He played 467 first class matches and batted 784 times with 71 not outs. He scored 25,453 first-class runs, with a best of 184, at an average of 35.69, with 55 centuries and 126 fifties. He took 429 catches, and 2 stumpings on his rare ventures behind the stumps. In 459 List A one-day matches, he scored 13,240 runs, with a top score of 142 not out at an average of 33.86, scoring 12 centuries, 89 fifties, and taking 171 catches and one stumping. He also played Minor Counties cricket for Suffolk .
He was a middle order batsman by inclination, but found greatest success at Test level as an opener . Selected for the 1986/87 tour of Australia as middle order cover, he ended up opening in all five Tests with Chris Broad . His top score was 96 in Perth . In the 1987 summer, he was initially meant to revert to the middle order, but an injury to Broad meant that he opened in the first Test with Tim Robinson . However, in the second Test he reverted to number three, and made his only Test hundred at Lord's .
He missed only one of twenty Test matches from 1986 to 1988. [1] Nevertheless, his 23 Test appearances were spread over eight years. He made his debut in the Centenary Test at Lord's in 1980, and eight years later appeared in the Bicentennial Test in Sydney, along with fellow survivors John Emburey and Mike Gatting .
Although never thought of as a one-day player, Athey hit two centuries in One Day Internationals , and top-scored for England before being run out in their Cricket World Cup final defeat against Australia at Calcutta in 1987 . He was suspended for playing in South Africa in 1990, but the suspension was remitted two years later when South Africa rejoined the world game.
Athey now works at Dulwich College school in South London, as the First XI Cricket Coach. He also takes the Second XI football team, and is house master of Old Blew, one of the four Dulwich College boarding houses.
Athey also played football and was on the books of Brentford Reserves in the early 1980s. [3]

Early life and education[ edit ]
Russell was born in Stroud, Gloucestershire , England. He gained the support he needed to become a first-class cricketer from his father, John, at Stroud Cricket Club, and at Archway School . [3] Two days before his fourteenth birthday, he saw a catch on television: McCosker , caught Knott , bowled Greig , at Headingley in 1977. Russell himself has commented: "Low-down, one-handed, across first-slip. Brilliant. I thought then that I would like to be able to do that. That's where it started; that was the inspiration [for becoming a wicket keeper ]."
The other inspiration cited was the death of his brother, David, of a brain haemorrhage ; Russell quickly rededicated himself. [3] Archway School's sports master, Ricky Rutter, guided Russell towards Gloucestershire County Cricket Club ; and, as a result, Russell stayed at Archway for one year of Sixth-Form college. He then headed to Bristol Technical College to study accountancy, leaving before completion to join Gloucestershire full-time in 1981. [3]

Test and ODI career[ edit ]
Mishra made his Test cricket debut against Australia in the Second Test at Mohali (PCA ground) after captain and first-choice leg spinner Anil Kumble was injured. He took 5 wickets for 71 runs in Australia's first innings and then 2/35 in the second, making him the leading wicket-taker in the match as India proceeded to a decisive victory. [1] Despite this, Indian coach Gary Kirsten said that Mishra would be dropped if Kumble recovered for the Third Test. However, Harbhajan Singh was injured so Mishra retained his place when Kumble came in. Kumble was then injured during the Test and retired, leaving Mishra as India's first-choice Test leg spinner.
Mishra was selected for the early-2009 Test tour of New Zealand, but India opted to field only one spinner, and he watched as Harbhajan performed the spin duties alone. Mishra played in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa. India's next Test was not until November 2009. Mishra took only one wicket in the high-scoring drawn First Test and he was dropped for the Second Test in favour of left arm orthodox spinner Pragyan Ojha , who retained his position for the Third Test as the second spinner.
Mishra was recalled for the tour of Bangladesh and played in the First Test in Chittagong as the only spinner after Harbhajan suffered an injury. He made 50 in the second innings as a night-watchman and took seven wickets. However, he was once again dropped in the next Test for Ojha. At the start of the tour, Mishra played in two ODIs against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in a triangular tournament after Harbhajan was rested for the final two round-robin matches. Later in the Indian Cricket Team in England 2011 he got his highest score ever in the last test match of 84.He has been recalled for one day series against Zimbabwe July 2013.He won man of the match award for his 4/47 bowling against Zimbabwe in 3rd ODI played on 28 July 2013. Mishra managed to get most wickets by any bowler in a 5-match series or tournament against Zimbabwe July 2013. The spinner also equalled Indian bowling great Javagal Srinath's world record for the most wickets in a bilateral ODI series with 18 wickets.Srinath managed his feat in 7 matches so Mishra equaled the record in less matches and can be proud of his bowling.
Amit Mishra bowled a fine spell for two wickets against Pakistan in the 6th match of Asia Cup on 2 February 2014. Mishra’s bowling figures of 2 for 28 from his 10 overs were the sixth best economical bowling figures in Asia Cup history (bowlers who have bowled a minimum of 10 overs are only considered). [2]

Dhawan was selected in the India Green squad in the Challenger Trophy in October 2008. He scored 45 against India Red and 7 against India Blue as India Green lost both matches and failed to qualify for the finals. Dhawan returned to form in the 2008-09 Ranji season by scoring 415 runs and averaging over 69.

[49] His good form continued in the Ranji Trophy as he scored 224 in the season's opening match against Baroda [50] and 100 in the second game against Karnataka . [51] However, he suffered an injury in the third match against Uttar Pradesh which kept him on the sidelines for four weeks.

[54] In February 2010, he played five matches for Delhi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and scored the most runs for his team - 327 runs at 81.75 including a century (155*) and two fifties - which earned him a spot in the North Zone team for Deodhar Trophy in March 2010. [55] He made an unbeaten 85 in the semifinal of the Deodhar Trophy against East Zone [56] and 48 in the final against West Zone, helping North Zone lift the title. [57] He was recalled in the India A squad which toured England in June–July 2010. In the first game of the tour, a three-day match against Yorkshire , Dhawan scored 179 off 208 balls to help India A post 473/3d. Yorkshire were bowled out for 219 in their first innings and the match ended in a draw. [58] He played in two four-day matches against West Indies A in which he had scores of 17, 21 and 43. In the limited-overs triangular series involving England Lions , India A and West Indies A, Dhawan scored 166 runs from 4 innings at an average of 41.50 and a strike rate of 130.70. [59]
Maiden India call-up[ edit ]
Dhawan was selected in the Rest of India squad to play against the defending Ranji champions Mumbai in the Irani Cup in October 2010. He scored 83 in the first innings and 13 in the second innings as Rest of India won by 361 runs. [60] He was then selected to play for India Blue in the Challengers Trophy. He was dismissed run out for a duck in the first game against India Red before he scored a 121-ball 109 in the second match against India Green. [61] India Red beat India Green in the final at Indore where he scored 44. [62]
During this time, Australia were on their two Tests-three ODIs tour of India . The Test series had just concluded with India winning 2-0. The Indian selectors selected a "second string" [63] squad for the ODI series as several first-choice senior players were either injured or rested. Shikhar Dhawan was picked in the 14-man squad which was the first occasion he featured in an Indian senior team squad. [64] Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni backed Dhawan before the series saying, "Both of us scored in the Challengers in Mumbai (in 2005). I got a chance to establish myself in the national team. There has been ups and downs in his career but he has been quite consistent. As an opener it's quite tough, as you have Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir all at the same level. It's good that he got a chance finally. Hope he scores and the bench will become stronger". [65] The first ODI at Kochi was washed out by rain. [66] Dhawan made his international debut, along with Saurabh Tiwary , in the second ODI at Visakhapatnam on 20 October 2010. Australia, who batted first, made 289/3 in 50 overs, and Dhawan opened the innings for India in the run-chase. He did not score off the first delivery and was bowled off the second by Clint McKay . However, India went on to win the match by 5 wickets. [67] The third ODI at Margao was called off due to a wet outfield. [68]
Return to domestic cricket and international recall[ edit ]
In November 2010, Dhawan returned to playing for Delhi in 2010-11 Ranji Trophy . He scored a total of 486 runs in 7 matches at an average of 44.18. [69] He registered only one hundred in that season, a 149 against Gujarat at Delhi after Gujarat were bowled out for 71 in their first innings. [70] He failed to make it to the Indian squad for the South African tour in December. In the Duleep Trophy in January 2011, he scored 21 & 53 against West Zone in the semifinal [71] and 5 & 19 against South Zone in the final. [72] His struggle with form continued in the Vijay Hazare Trophy as he averaged just 22 from 4 matches. [73] He was included in the North Zone squad for the Deodhar Trophy in March 2011. He took 1/20 and score 71 in the semifinal against Central Zone to give his team a five-wicket win. [74] In the low-scoring final against West Zone, he was bowled by Jaydev Unadkat for 8. [75]
In June 2011, India toured the West Indies for three Tests, five ODIs and one T20I. India's regular openers in limited-overs, Sehwag and Gambhir were ruled out of the tour due to shoulder injuries, whereas Tendulkar decided to rest himself after India's World Cup win and the 2011 IPL . [76] The selectors picked Dhawan in the limited-overs squad in spite of his poor performance in the previous domestic season as he showed signs of returning to form during the 2011 IPL. He made his T20I debut against West Indies on 4 June 2011 at Port of Spain where he opened the innings with Parthiv Patel and was dismissed for 5 off 11 balls caught behind to keeper Andre Fletcher off the bowling of Darren Sammy . India won the match by 16 runs. [77] In the first ODI of the tour, with India needing 215 to win, Dhawan scored 51 of 76 balls (3 fours, 1 six) which was his maiden ODI fifty. India eventually won the match by 4 wickets with 31 balls to spare thanks to Rohit Sharma 's contribution. [78] He had scores of 3 and 4 in the second and third ODIs respectively with India winning both games. In the fourth ODI, he was replaced by Manoj Tiwary who scored 2 off 17 balls as India lost the match by 103 runs. [79] Dhawan returned to the team in the final ODI and scored 11. West Indies won the match by 7 wickets while India took the series 3-2. [80]
Back on the fringes[ edit ]
After his poor in the West Indies , Dhawan was unable to find a place in the Indian squad that toured England later that year and resumed his domestic commitments. In October 2011, playing for Rest of India against Rajasthan in the Irani Cup final at Jaipur , he scored 177 off 165 balls in the first innings and 155 off 126 balls in the second innings. Rest of India went on to win the match by 404 runs, and Dhawan was awarded the man of the match for his efforts. [81] He then played for India Red in the Challenger Trophy. He did not bat in the first match against India Green and scored 3 in the second match against India Blue. India Red won both the games and qualified for the final. India Red captain Gautam Gambhir left for international duty and Dhawan was named the captain of the team for the final against India Green. He scored just one run in the final which ended in a tie . [82] He was out of form in the 2011-12 Ranji Trophy as he scored 296 runs at an average of 32.88 with no hundreds, [83] while Delhi finished sixth in their seven-team group and could not progress to the knockout stage. [84] He scored 40 & 38 for North Zone in the Duleep Trophy semifinal against East Zone in February 2012. East Zone qualified for the final on first-innings lead. [85] He returned to form in the Vijay Hazare Trophy in February–March 2012, scoring 291 runs in eight matches at an average of 48.50 including three fifties. [86] Delhi managed to reach the semifinal which they lost to Mumbai . North Zone won the Deodhar Trophy in March 2012, but Dhawan had scores of 7 and 0 in the semifinal and final respectively.
In June 2012, India A toured West Indies to play 3 four-day matches, 3 List A matches and two T20s against West Indies A, and Dhawan was included in the India A squad. [87] He struggled with the bat in the entire tour, failing to post a single fifty-plus score. He averaged 7.50 in the first two four-day matches before getting dropped from the team for the third game. [88] In the two T20s, he averaged 27 with a strike rate of less than 100, [89] and scored 49 runs in the two List A matches at an average of 24.50. [90]
Dhawan was in sublime form at the start of the 2012-13 season. He played for India A in the Challenger Trophy in September–October 2012. In the first match against Bengal , he scored an unbeaten 99 to help India A chase down the target of 194 for the loss of two wickets and won the man of the match award. [91] He scored a 139-ball 152 in the next match against India B, as India A won by 4 runs. [92] In the final against India B, he scored 61, but India A were bowled out for 217 and fell short of the target by 139 runs. [93] In the Duleep Trophy that followed, he was named the captain of the North Zone squad. He won the man of the match award in the quarterfinal match against West Zone, after scoring 101 & 50. He was stumped in both innings by off-spinner Kamlesh Makvana . North Zone progressed to the semifinal by virtue of first innings lead. [94] In the semifinal against Central Zone, Dhawan scored 121 & 37. The match was drawn, and Central Zone qualified for the final because of their 18-run first innings lead. [95] He continued his good form in the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy , scoring 461 runs including two centuries at an average of 51.22. [96] Delhi missed a spot in the knockouts by one point. [97] Dhawan was named captain of Delhi for the one-off List A match against the touring England team in January 2013. He scored 110 off 109 balls in Delhi's run-chase of 295, helping Delhi win the match by 6 wickets. [98] He was then selected in the Rest of India squad for 2013 Irani Cup match against Mumbai in February 2013. Opening the innings with Murali Vijay , he scored 63 & 0. The match ended in a draw, but Rest of India retained the title on first innings lead.
Test debut and Champions Trophy[ edit ]
After his consistent performance in the 2012-13 domestic season, Dhawan was rewarded with a call-up to the Indian Test squad in February 2013 for the four-match series against Australia . He was the third-choice opener in the squad which consisted of Test regulars Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay. India chose Sehwag and Vijay over Dhawan in the first two Tests. India won both the matches, but Sehwag was dropped from the squad for the remaining two Tests of the series owing to his poor form. [99] No replacement was named in the squad for Sehwag, which made Dhawan the favorite to take his place in the third Test. Dhawan made his Test debut in the third Test at Mohali on 14 March 2013, receiving the cap from Sachin Tendulkar who said to him: "We have known you as a very gutsy player in domestic cricket, now we hope to see you as a gutsy player in international cricket, so show us some guts." [100] The first day of the match was washed out by rain, and Australia elected to bat first after winning the toss on the second day. Australia were bowled out for 408 on the morning of the third day. In reply, India opened the innings with Dhawan and Vijay. The duo batted out the rest of the third day taking India to 283 for no loss at stumps on third day, with Dhawan batting on 185 and Vijay batting on 83. In the process, Dhawan scored the fastest century ever on Test debut, off 85 balls, and also broke the long-held record of highest score by an Indian debutant held by Gundappa Viswanath (137 vs Australia at Kanpur, 1969). Dhawan was dismissed for 187 (174 balls) in the second over of the fourth day, caught by Ed Cowan at silly point off the bowling of Nathan Lyon . [101] He did not bat in India's second innings after suffering a hand injury while fielding during the fourth day. India went on to win the match by 6 wickets, and Dhawan won the man of the match award. [102] He missed the fourth Test at Delhi after being ruled out for six weeks due to a fracture in his left hand. [103]
Dhawan made his comeback from injury during the 2013 Indian Premier League in a match for Sunrisers Hyderabad against Chennai Super Kings on 25 April and scored 63 runs from 45 balls. [104] He played 10 matches that season and scored 311 runs at an average of 38.87 including three fifties. [105] His good form helped him gain selection to the Indian ODI squad for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy that was to be held in England in June. [106] He opened the innings with Vijay in the warm-up matches and had scores of 1 and 17 against Sri Lanka and Australia respectively, despite which India won both games. [107] [108] Dhawan opened the batting with Rohit Sharma in the main event and the pair found success. In the tournament's opening match between India and South Africa at Cardiff , Dhawan scored his maiden ODI hundred. His innings of 114 came from 94 balls including 12 fours and a six. He shared an opening partnership of 127 runs with Sharma. India won and he was named man of the match. [109] In India's next match against West Indies, he scored an unbeaten 102 off 107 balls, his second ODI hundred, adding 101 for the first wicket with Sharma. India chased down the target of 234 for the loss of two wickets and more than 10 overs to spare. [110] India's last group fixture was a rain-curtailed match at Birmingham against Pakistan, which India won by 8 wickets (D/L method). Dhawan scored 48 off 41 balls in this match. [111] India topped the group table by winning all matches and qualified for the semifinals. In the semifinal match against Sri Lanka, he scored a 92-ball 68 which helped India win by 8 wickets with 15 overs to spare. [112] This win took India to the final at Birmingham where they would face the hosts England. The final was reduced to 20-overs-a-side after rain delayed the start of play. India batted first and made 129/7 with Dhawan scoring 31 runs off 24 balls. India went on to win the match by 5 runs. [113] Dhawan, who scored 363 runs from 5 matches at an average of 90.75 and a strike rate of over 100, [114] won the Golden Bat award for scoring the most runs in the tournament and was also named player of the tournament. [113]
Cementing his place[ edit ]
The Indian team then went to the West Indies for a triangular series against West Indies and Sri Lanka. Dhawan scored 135 runs in five games at an average of 27. [115] His only half-century in the series came against West Indies at Port of Spain where he made 69 off 77 balls. [116] India won the series by beating Sri Lanka in the final in which he scored 16. [117] In July–August, India toured Zimbabwe for five ODIs, resting several first-choice players, under the captaincy of Virat Kohli . Dhawan scored a total of 209 runs in four matches at an average of 52.25 and finished as the leading run-getter of the series, while India won the series 5–0. [118] In the second match at Harare , he scored his third ODI century. He was awarded the man of the match for his innings of 116 which helped India post 294/8 after being 65/4 in the 17th over. [119]
"I haven't seen a better innings in one-day cricket than this one. The way he batted today, I thought he would get 300. They were clean hits, all proper cricketing shots. He pulled, he cut, he drove. He played all shots today and it was a real treat to watch."
–India A coach Lalchand Rajput on Dhawan's knock of 248. [120]
In August 2013, he played for India A on its to tour South Africa. He continued to be in good form in the triangular series against South Africa A and Australia A . He recorded the second-highest List A innings of all time by scoring 248 runs off 150 balls [121] against South Africa A in the last group match of the series at Pretoria , the winner of which would play Australia A in the final. His innings included 30 fours and seven sixes, and helped India A put up 433/3 on board and win the match by 39 runs. [122] [123] After the match, South Africa A captain Justin Ontong described Dhawan's knock as "the best one-day innings" he had ever seen, and added "Every shot he hit found the gap or went over the fielders. It was like watching a highlights package. He hit so many good shots, it's hard to pick out one that stood out. There were a few sixes that went into the construction site." [124] Dhawan then scored 62 in the final against Australia A as India A clinched the series with a 50-run win. [125] He finished as the highest run-getter of the series, scoring 410 runs at an average of 102.50 and a strike rate of over 135. [126]
Australia toured India in October and November 2013 for one T20I and seven ODIs. Dhawan scored a personal best 32 in the T20I game which India won. In the ODIs, he scored 284 runs in 6 innings at an average of 56.80 and was involved in three century opening stands with Rohit Sharma . In the second ODI at Jaipur, Dhawan scored 95 off 86 balls to help India chase down the target of 360 for the loss of just one wicket, the second highest successful run-chase in the history of ODI cricket. In the sixth game at Nagpur, he scored a 102-ball 100, his fourth ODI century, which helped India successfully chase Australia's total of 350. He was dismissed for 60 in the final match at Bangalore which India won to clinch the series. In November 2013, after being unable to convert starts into big knocks in the tt he wanted to make amends.
"It was a perfect scenario," Dhoni said. "We had got off to a good start on a good batting track and the ball was old. I think that suited my form of batting because that is my strength. In between, if there is a situation, I can go back [on the defensive] like the Lord's innings ."
"But I should play the kind of cricket that I play more often, and that is aggressive cricket. In between I was not really playing my natural game, thinking more about the scenario and conditions. I need to play to my strength which is going out there looking to score runs. It is not only about hitting, it's about being fractionally more positive than others."
There was a beautiful moment after the completion of India's 320-run win. While everybody rushed to grab a stump as a souvenir, Ganguly merely walked up to congratulate his team-mates. Dhoni gave the man playing his last series, and also a centurion in this match, the stump he had taken for himself.
Dhoni later revealed that watching Ganguly was the most special part of this Test. "Sourav's getting to 7000 was very special. This is his last series and he is just going out and enjoying the game. He doesn't have any sort of pressure and that's how you want him to play. Sourav at his best, when he is playing his shots, is very different to others." And Ganguly, on his part, has played outstanding innings in both the Tests that Dhoni has captained.
Keeping calm on the field is quickly becoming Dhoni's signature, and he kept his cool off it as well, when a couple of potentially explosive questions were put to him. He was asked about his players' behaviour during the Test - Zaheer Khan was fined 80% of his match fee - and whether overtly aggressive sledging was the only way to beat Australia. "The only way to beat Australia is to play good consistent cricket," was Dhoni's response. "If it was verbal we would have had hired a few guys who are very good in that aspect." The reporters, if looking for a controversial quote, could only smile in resignation.
Dhoni was also asked to explain his appeal for a catch against Mitchell Johnson, one that he had taken on the bounce. Dhoni had appealed but straightaway asked the umpire to call the third umpire because he was not sure. Ricky Ponting was asked a similar question after the Sydney Test and he responded angrily asking the journalist whether he was questioning his integrity. Dhoni's response, however, was different. "I was not sure about the catch so I immediately got up and asked the umpire [gestures as if referring a decision to the third umpire], and Rudi [Koertzen] said that he [Johnson] never nicked it.  So there was no point," Dhoni said.
"There are times when the ball bounces in front of you and you are not really sure. Your eyes are closed at times but when you feel hard [impact] on the gloves, you think it has carried to you. Since, in this series, it is not about players, it is ultimately the umpire's decision whether to refer to the third umpire or not."
His jokes apart, it was a perfect match for Dhoni. He won the toss and batted India to a dominant position in the first innings, almost all his bowling changes seemed to work, and, most importantly, he brought a ruthless touch to India's approach while setting a target.
However, like he did in Kanpur, Dhoni was wearing Anil Kumble's blazer when he went out for the toss. "Stand-in captain, stand-in blazer," Dhoni said. The way he is going they might need to stitch one for him soon.

India v Australia, 2nd Test, Mohali October 16, 2008
Not much for spin, especially from overseas
A statistical preview to the second Test between India and Australia in Mohali
  shares
The lacklustre performance of the spinners was a talking point in the first Test, with Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh way below their best and Cameron White, though exceeding expectations, barely troubling the Indian batsmen. However, the reputation of the Punjab Cricket Association stadium in Mohali- where Australia haven't played a Test- won't encourage them too much; it's among the least favourable venues for spin in India.
Of seven Tests in Mohali, India have lost one - the first there, against West Indies- and won two, both against England. Kumble and Harbhajan took 25 of the 40 wickets in those two wins and India will look for a similar performance from them over the next five days.
India's record in Mohali



FC
Profile
With a charging run-up, powerful delivery, worrying bounce and elongated appeal, Peter Siddle has been a reassuringly consistent presence in Australia's Test attack since 2008. A hard-working, hostile fast bowler who has not always been viewed as the epitome of subtlety, Siddle has been used as an enforcer, a workhorse and at times as the spearhead of Australia's bowling group. But he is also a man of contradictions, a tough rural Victorian who was a competitive woodchopper in his youth, yet since 2012 a vegan whose diet can consist of 15 to 20 bananas a day. Such a diet would hardly have appealed to Merv Hughes, a fellow Victorian who filled a similar role in Australia's team in the 1980s and 90s and, like Siddle since 2010, was largely considered a Test-match specialist.
First picked for the tour of India in 2008-09, Siddle made his Test debut in Mohali and hit Gautam Gambhir in the head with his first ball, before claiming Sachin Tendulkar as his maiden Test wicket. Solid performances in the back-to-back series against South Africa confirmed his place in the side and he was a committed figure during the 2009 Ashes tour - loud and brash on the field and calm off it - and a first-innings 5 for 21 in Leeds helped him to 20 wickets. In October of that year, he was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year, but a quiet home Test summer was followed by a stress fracture in his back, which required lengthy rehabilitation.
His comeback could hardly have been more memorable. At the Gabba on the opening day of the 2010-11 Ashes series, Siddle celebrated his 26th birthday by becoming the ninth Australian to take a Test hat-trick, his yorker at Stuart Broad's toes leading to a typically animated, and successful, lbw appeal. The series was a fiasco for Australia, but Siddle at least managed to collect 6 for 75 on his home ground at the MCG, even if Australia were crushed in the match. The following summer he bowled with more pace, swing and accuracy and collected 23 wickets at 18.65 in the 4-0 thrashing of India, and was Man of the Match in the final Test in Adelaide after taking 5 for 49 in the first innings on a good batting pitch.
Adelaide again proved eventful for Siddle the next season. After flying home from the 2012 tour of the West Indies with a back injury, Siddle returned to the side against South Africa and his energy levels under his new diet were tested to the maximum at Adelaide Oval. The loss of James Pattinson mid-match to an injury left Siddle with a huge workload; he sent down 63.5 overs in the Test, the most by an Australian fast bowler this century. By the closing stages of day five with Australia seeking two wickets to win, Siddle was down on his haunches between balls, exhausted and, he later admitted, "a little bit delirious". Siddle claimed four wickets in the innings but South Africa held on for a draw, and the workload led to Siddle missing the next Test. When he returned for the first Test against Sri Lanka, he responded with a career best match haul of 9 for 104.
Siddle struggled for impact on Australia's hopeless 2012-13 tour of India but was typically persistent and reliable in the back-to-back Ashes campaigns in 2013-14. He showed intelligence in his use of the crease to add variety and his ability to build pressure on England's batsmen with consistent lines and lengths made him an important, if under-rated, member of the attack. But a preference for out-and-out pace from the selectors led to Siddle losing his spot in the team during the tour of South Africa in early 2014, and he was asked to work on regaining the yard of speed he had lost.
Siddle grew up in Morwell in rural Victoria and was already a promising competitive woodchopper when he  Free Encyclopedia.

1987 home
England v New Zealand 1986
England may have been spared another Lord's defeat in the 1980s when the sort of weather that spoiled so many Test matches there in the 1970s robbed this match of almost half the fourth day. None the less, England needed a long and commanding innings from Gooch, his second Test hundred at Lord's in 1986, to save the game.
It would hardly be a drawn Lord's Test without rain and bad light plus a much-discussed, if short-lived controversy. This came on the second day when French, England's injured wicket-keeper, was replaced by the former England wicket-keeper, R. W. Taylor. French had been struck on the back of the helmet when he turned away from a Hadlee bouncer, the resulting cut requiring three stitches and the blow leaving him groggy until after the weekend. Athey deputised for two overs at the start of the New Zealand innings until Taylor could hurry round the ground - from his duties as a host for Cornhill, the match's sponsor - and equip himself with an assortment of borrowed kit, although he did, far-sightedly, have his own gloves in his car. Despite having retired from first-class cricket two years earlier, Taylor, at the age of 45, kept almost without a blemish. He did his old job until the 76th over, near the lunch interval on Saturday, after which R. J. Parks of Hampshire, following his father and grandfather, appeared in a Test match. However, Parks, a more authentic substitute, should have been on stand-by at the start of play because recovery from such a head wound is seldom immediate. French finally resumed his appointed role for one ball on Monday morning. All these switches were made with the generous permission of New Zealand's captain, Coney. With substitutes also needed for Willey and Foster and for Coney and Jeff Crowe, 29 players took the field at various times.
Even before the match, injuries had given England anxieties. Willey was called in after Emburey had broken his nose in a Sunday League match and Pringle was declared unfit just before the toss, which meant that England's XI was pre-determined for the second consecutive Test. Dilley, the man who withdrew at Birmingham on the first morning of the third Test against India, was back. Moxon, who replaced Benson as Gooch's opening partner, underpinned England's steady development to 248 for five after Gatting had won the toss. However, it was soon evident that two different games were taking place - one when Hadlee was bowling and the other when he was out of the attack. He took a wicket in each of his first two spells and in his fourth disposed of Moxon and Gatting. on the second day he and Watson went through England's later batsmen, and with six for 80 Hadlee equalled I. T. Botham's record of five or more wickets in a Test innings 26 times.
Dilley's fast, accurate opening spell brought the wickets of Wright and Rutherford, but Edgar and Martin Crowe responded in their characteristic ways. Edgar existed at 1 run an over for most of his 298-ball innings while Crowe eased the situation with increasing aggression. Both were 52 not out at the end of a day in which 25 overs were lost, and gradually they transformed a recovery into a position from which their side could strike for victory. Crowe's range of strokes during an innings of 5 hours, 40 minutes (247 balls, eleven of which he hit for 4) showed the English cricket-watcher that he had entered the ranks of world-class batsmen. Their partnership of 210 was a record for New Zealand's third wicket against England, surpassing Hastings and Congdon's 190, also at Lord's, in 1973. When they were dismissed in successive overs, Coney made a brisk, consolidating half-century, and only Edmonds prevented the match from running entirely New Zealand's way. Their innings was ended by the first ball on Monday, their lead 35.
Hadlee made his customary initial breakthrough and Gray, turning the ball out of the footmarks, achieved a remarkable double, by bowling a right-hander, Athey, and a left-hander, Gower, around their legs, as they made technically inept attempts to combat him. From then on, pads were frequently favoured to counter the slow left-armer as he toiled for 4 overs.
Only 21 overs were bowled after lunch, and at 110 for three, only 75 ahead, England were looking to a long partnership between Gooch and Gatting. Instead, the latter's over-ambitious stroke on the final morning put an extra burden on the former. Gooch, however, coped in masterly fashion and had the ideal partner in the resolute Willey. The new ball, taken with England 146 in front with four hours left, was the last obstacle, and when it was surmounted Gooch played with great freedom in the afternoon sun. He had batted for 441 minutes, received 368 balls and hit 22 4s when his dismissal to a catch at long-off brought the declaration. This allowed England to dismiss two top-order New Zealand batsmen for 0 for the second time - Wright for a "pair" - both falling to slip catches by Gower that deserved a more meaningful setting.
For his innings which secured the draw for England, Gooch was named Man of the Match. The overall attendance was 69,184 and receipts £531,434.

Le rôle de gardien de guichet. Commentaire en anglais, le bouton « CC » permet d'accéder aux sous-titres en français.
Au centre du terrain de cricket se trouve une bande de 20,12 m de long sur trois mètres de large appelée piste . On trouve à chaque extrémité de la piste une structure composée de trois piquets de bois verticaux surmontés de deux témoins horizontaux : le guichet . L'équipe à la batte, qui doit marquer des points appelés courses , dispose de deux joueurs à la fois sur le terrain : les batteurs , qui sont de chaque côté de la piste, devant l'un des guichets. L'un est inactif, l'autre est actif : il fait face au lancer. Parmi les onze joueurs de l'équipe adverse, appelés chasseurs (les joueurs de champ) et tous présents sur le terrain, le gardien est celui qui se trouve juste derrière le guichet du batteur actif.
Plusieurs modes d' élimination des batteurs impliquent ou peuvent impliquer le gardien de guichet adverse. Il effectue un arrêt de volée s'il attrape la balle au vol après que celle-ci a touché la batte du batteur adverse. Cette élimination peut être réalisée par n'importe quel autre chasseur [1] . Comme tout autre joueur de champ, il peut également être impliqué dans un run out  : un des batteurs adverses est éliminé si l'un des joueurs de champ détruit l'un des guichet pendant que ceux-ci sont en train de courir pour marquer une course [2] .
Il est par contre le seul joueur de champ à pouvoir réaliser un stumping . Le batteur actif, au moment du lancer, à ses deux pieds de part et d'autre d'une ligne appelée popping crease . Il peut s'avancer vers la balle au moment où celle-ci est en l'air. S'il n'a ni l'un de ses pieds ni la batte posés au sol entre la popping crease et le guichet qu'il défend, il est dit « out of his field ». S'il est dans cette situation et manque la balle, il est stumped si le gardien récupère la balle et détruit le guichet avec celle-ci [3] .
En dehors de cela, son rôle est tout simplement d'attraper toute balle qui passe à proximité de lui. En effet, si le batteur adverse manque la balle avec sa batte, lui et son coéquipier peuvent quand même marquer des runs [4] , appelés byes .
Règles spécifiques[ modifier | modifier le code ]
Le gardien doit rester derrière le guichet près duquel il se trouve au moins jusqu'à ce que la balle lancée ait touché soit la batte soit le corps du batteur situé devant lui [5] .
En outre, il n'a pas le droit d'effectuer de mouvements significatifs en direction du guichet avant que la balle lancée n'atteigne le batteur [5] .
Dans les deux cas, si le gardien contrevient à ces règles, l' arbitre peut signaler une no ball , une balle à rejouer qui rapporte une course à l'équipe adverse [5] .
Équipement[ modifier | modifier le code ]
Gants de gardien de guichet.
Le gardien de guichet est le seul joueur de l'équipe à avoir le droit de porter des gants durant la chasse [5] .
Ces gants ne doivent pas être palmés, sauf entre le pouce et l' index , où ils peuvent l'être [5] . La matière qui relie ces deux doigts doit être mise de telle sorte que, lorsque les doigts sont tendus, elle ne dépasse pas une ligne virtuelle joignant le bout de l'index au bout du pouce [6] .

Popping crease[ edit ]
The term popping crease refers to the early history of the game of cricket , when batsmen used to have to 'pop' their bats into a small hole that was located in the middle of the crease for a run to count. For a player to run a batsman out, he had to pop the ball into the hole before the bat was grounded in it. [1] [2]
One popping crease is drawn at each end of the pitch in front of each set of stumps. The popping crease is 4 feet (1.22 m) in front of and parallel to the bowling crease. Although it is considered to have unlimited length (in other words, runs across the entire field) the popping crease must be marked to at least 6 feet (1.83 metres) perpendicular to the pitch, on either side of the middle of the pitch. [1] [2]
For the fielding side[ edit ]
For the fielding team the popping crease is used as one test of whether the bowler has bowled a no ball. To avoid a no ball, some part of the bowler's front foot in the delivery stride (that is, the stride when he releases the ball ) must be behind the popping crease, although it does not have to be grounded. The foot may be on the line as long as some part of his/her foot is behind the line. [1] [3] This has given rise to the term "the line belongs to the umpire." [4]
For the batting side[ edit ]
For a batsman the popping crease - which can be referred to as the batting crease in the context of batting - determines whether they have been stumped or run out. This is described in Laws 29, 38, and 39 of the laws of cricket . [2] Both involve the wicket being put down before a batsman can touch his body or bat to the ground behind the popping crease and make his ground and return safely from his run. [5] A 2010 amendment to Law 29 clarified the circumstance where the wicket is put down while a batsman has become fully airborne after having first made his ground; the batsman is regarded to not be out of his ground. [6]
If the batsman facing the bowler (the striker) steps out of his ground to play the ball but misses and the wicket-keeper takes the ball and puts down the wicket, then the striker is out stumped . [2]
If a fielder puts down either wicket whilst the batsmen are running between the wickets (or otherwise forward of the popping crease during the course of play), then the batsman nearest the downed wicket is out run out . There is no limit of how far a bowler may bowl behind the crease. [1]
The popping crease is visible here, with England's Marcus Trescothick playing a shot that has involved him moving forward over his own crease to intercept the ball. In taking a successful run, he must ground his bat behind the corresponding crease at the other end of the pitch, and his batting partner must in turn ground himself behind Trescothick's crease. [2] Should Trescothick have ventured beyond his crease in playing his shot, he risked being stumped. [1] [2]
David Masters bowling, he must ground some part of his foot behind his popping crease and within the return creases for the ball to be a legal delivery. As a member of the fielding side, he can also attempt to run out a batsman by breaking the stumps with the ball before the batsman manages to return to the popping crease. [1] [2]
Here the batsman has played a shot and missed, with the wicketkeeper receiving the ball. The 'keeper, believing that in playing his shot the batsman has ventured beyond his popping crease, has broken the stumps with the ball in an attempt to dismiss him 'stumped'. He is appealing to the umpire to review and either accept or refuse the dismissal. It now falls to the umpire to adjudge whether the batsman had indeed ventured beyond his crease, a decision that in modern cricket is assisted by technology and replays.
Return crease[ edit ]
Four return creases are drawn, one on each side of each set of stumps. The return creases lie perpendicular to the popping crease and the bowling crease, 4 feet 4 inches (1.32 m) either side of and parallel to the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each return crease line starts at the popping crease but the other end is considered to be unlimited in length and must be marked to a minimum of 8 feet (2.44 m) from the popping crease. [1] [2]
The return creases are primarily used to determine whether the bowler has bowled a no ball. To avoid a no ball, some part of the bowler's back foot in the delivery stride must land within and not touch the return crease. This is to stop the bowler from bowling at the batsmen from an unfair angle (i.e. diagonally). [1]
Using the crease[ edit ]
Though the relatively small size of the crease is such that they limit the degree to which a batsman or a bowler can alter where they stand to face or deliver a ball, there is a degree of latitude afforded whereby both can move around the crease as long as they remain within the aforementioned confines. Batsmen 'use the crease' when they move toward leg or off , before or while playing a shot. Bowlers 'use the crease' by varying the position of their feet, relative to the stumps, at the moment of delivery. In so doing, they can alter the angle of delivery and the trajectory of the ball. [2]

It's goodbye for sure: Sourav Ganguly's first Test hundred at home against Australia won't result in a change of plan

A 16th Test century in Mohali won't change Sourav Ganguly's plans to retire after the India-Australia Tests, he said on Saturday. Ganguly's 102 helped India to a formidable 469 on the second day of the second Test, but the innings hasn't forced a rethink for the former India captain.
"I think it's the right decision and I have no regrets," Ganguly said. "I just don't want to play any more, to be honest. I've been playing well for the last two years.
Ganguly has had a consistent run since returning to the team in December 2006, but was dropped from the Rest of India squad - primarily consisting of Test regulars - after a poor series in Sri Lanka. Ganguly, however, found a place in the Test squad picked by a new set of selectors and surprised all by announcing his retirement before the first Test in Bangalore.
"Except for the Sri Lanka series, I've had an outstanding two years," he said. "But it's just that I feel the time has come to go."
He said he was pleased with his effort in Mohali - Ganguly walked in at 163 for 4 and shared century stands with Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. "I'm just happy to get runs," he said. "I still hopefully have five innings to go [before retirement]. I will try to do well and finish off well.
"I've tried to enjoy every single day because every day will be the last," he said. "I'm trying to do my best."
During his innings, Ganguly became the fourth Indian batsman to go past 7000 Test runs. Ganguly has 11,363 ODI runs at an average over 40 - similar to that in Tests - but he said it's the performance in the five-day format that would be remembered in spite of the emergence of Twenty20.
"You will be remembered in what you have done in Test matches. First Test matches, then one-day cricket," he said. "When you talk about great players, you talk about a [Sunil] Gavaskar or [Steve] Waugh or Tendulkar or [Ricky] Ponting. It's because of their performances in Test matches. Not what they do in Twenty20."
India began the series with question marks over the future of their senior players, but Ganguly felt performance, and not age, should be considered. "It's going to be an individual decision for everyone. Age is no bar," he said. "It's the runs you get and people like [VVS] Laxman, Sachin and Rahul [Dravid] have been scoring runs. They should be judged on their performance."

Is it true that Batsmen are offensive, and bowlers defensive? To win at cricket (not limited overs) you have to take 20 wickets. If the openers make 600 between them but the bowlers fail to get enough wickets, then it's a draw. It seems strange to call Geoff Boycott, offensive and Shane Warne, defensive. 192.28.0.20 ( talk ) 12:43, 28 February 2010 (UTC)
Yes, this seems to be an attempt to Americanise a cricket template... the bowlers are generally refeventually took up cricket at 14. He became a successful youth player whose honours included taking 11 for 47 in a state under-17 match, breaking the long-standing record of John Scholes, the late Victoria coach. Injuries hampered his early domestic career, with a shoulder reconstruction sidelining him for most of 2006-07 and further shoulder problems troubling him the following season.

Etymology[ edit ]
The word steak originates from the mid-15th century Scandinavian word steik , or stickna' in the Middle English dialect, along with the Old Norse word steikja. [5] The Oxford English Dictionary's first reference is to "a thick slice of meat cut for roasting or grilling or frying, sometimes used in a pie or pudding; especially a piece cut from the hind-quarters of the animal." Subsequent parts of the entry, however, refer to "steak fish", which referred to "cod of a size suitable for cutting into steaks", and also "steak-raid", which was a custom among Scottish Highlanders of giving some cattle being driven through a gentleman's land to the owner. [6] An early written usage of the word "stekys" comes from a 15th-century cookbook, and makes reference to both beef or venison steaks. [7]
See also: Meat cutter and Meat packing industry
Livestock for meat to be used as steak cuts may be raised on a farm or ranch . The meat from various wild game may also be used for steak cuts.
The trade in steaks from bushmeat is a serious threat to biodiversity, as commercial harvesting could endanger species. [8]

A standing rib roast , also known as prime rib, which is cut into steaks
Countries with enough suitable land for grazing animals, in particular cattle, have a history of production and culinary use of steak. Such countries include Argentina, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, the United States and the United Kingdom. In Asian countries, such as China and Korea, steak is traditionally sliced and stir-fried and served in smaller amounts as part of a mixed dish. [9]
Argentina[ edit ]
In Argentina, beef represents a large portion of the country's export market. A total of 11.8 million animals were slaughtered in 2010. The country has one of the largest consumptions of beef per capita worldwide, [10] and much of it is barbecued steak. Beef steak consumption is described as part of the "Argentine national identity". [11] In 2010, there were 244,000 cattle producers in Argentina. [12] In Argentina, a steakhouse is referred to as a parrilla, which are common throughout the country. [13] Portion sizes of steak dishes in Argentine restaurants tend to be large, with steaks weighing over 454 grams (one pound) being commonplace. [14] Asado is a traditional dish that often includes steak and is also the standard word for "barbecue" in Argentina and other countries. Asado is considered a national dish of the country. [15]
Australia[ edit ]
Domestic and international marketing of Australian beef is undertaken by Meat & Livestock Australia , a corporation which runs programs related to quality assurance, sustainable production and environmental considerations, through organizations such as Meat Standards Australia (MLA). [16]
Ireland[ edit ]
The Irish agricultural beef market is a contributor to the economy of Ireland. A significant amount of Irish beef is exported to other countries, with over 50% of exported beef going to the United Kingdom. [17]
New Zealand[ edit ]
The "Steak of Origin" competition has been run for a decade on behalf of the Beef+Lamb Corporation of New Zealand. It "aims to find the most tender and tasty sirloin steak" in the country. Criteria for judging claims to include "tenderness, pH , marbling and % cooking loss" however while this data is collected for each entrant steak, only the shear force (correlated to perceived tenderness) determines qualification to a tasting panel, at which objective taste from a panel determines the winner. The pH is used solely to disqualify entrants and neither the 'marbling' or the '% cooking loss' have any effect on the outcome of the competition at any stage. Their parallel competition which they run for lamb legs "Glammies" does take into account some of these other metrics when weighting the entrants for their ranking within the competition. [18]
South Africa[ edit ]
South Africa uses steak to create biltong , a popular and exported dried and cured form that has found a market in many beef-eating countries.
United Kingdom[ edit ]
In the United Kingdom, steak is often served with chips and various vegetable accompaniments.
According to a survey by trade magazine Caterer and Hotelkeeper, the most popular dinner menu in British restaurants in the 1980s included steak: being prawn cocktail, steak and Black Forest gateau . [19]
Cattle breeds such as Hereford or Aberdeen Angus date back to the 1700s, and a handful of farmers continue to raise cattle sired by registered pedigree bulls. Bullocks, which live outdoors year-round, grow slowly as they would in their natural habitat, ultimately producing a distinctly tender meat. [20] Around 2,200,000 cattle are slaughtered for beef each year in the United Kingdom. [21]
United States[ edit ]
In the United States, cuts of beef for retail sale include various beefsteaks, as well as stew meat and hamburger meat. [22] In the U.S. circa 1956, approximately 24% of retail beef cuts were beef steaks. [22]
Beef production is the largest single agriculture in the United States, with 687,540 farms raising cattle and over a million in the production process, as of the 2007 Agriculture Census. On average, a single farm typically raises about 50 cattle at a time, with 97 percent of the cattle farms classified as one of these small family farms. These smaller farms average a gross cash income of $62,286 per year as of 2007. [23] [24]



Schutzausrüstung[ Bearbeiten ]
Der Wicket-Keeper ist der einzige Spieler der Feldmannschaft, der Handschuhe und äußere Beinschützer (Leg Guards) tragen darf. Daneben trägt er regelmäßig einen Unterleibsschutz (Box).
Heutzutage tragen Wicket-Keeper oftmals einen Helm, wenn sie unmittelbar hinter dem Wicket stehen, obwohl dieser die Beweglichkeit des Spielers stark einschränkt.
Aufgaben[ Bearbeiten ]
Die Hauptaufgabe des Wicket-Keepers ist es, Runs zu verhindern, indem er Bälle stoppt, die vom Schlagmann ( Batsman ) nicht geschlagen wurden.
Daneben ist er häufig an Dismissals beteiligt. Einerseits wird der Ball oft vom Wicket-Keeper gefangen, wenn er den Schläger des Batsman nur knapp berührt hat. Eine Stumping liegt vor, wenn der Wicket-Keeper das Wicket auf regelgerechte Weise zerstört und der Batsman zu diesem Zeitpunkt vor seiner Schlaglinie (popping crease) steht und keinen Run zu erzielen versucht. Schließlich fängt der Wicket-Keeper häufig Rückwürfe aus dem Feld, die dann zu einem Run Out führen, wenn der Batsman, der versucht, einen Run zu erzielen, nicht rechtzeitig hinter seine Schlaglinie kommt.
Bei einem schnellen Werfer (Fast Bowler) hockt der Wicket-Keeper in einiger Entfernung vom Wicket, um hinreichend Reaktionszeit zu haben. Bei einem langsameren Werfer (Slow Bowler), insbesondere bei Werfern, die den Spin des Balles nutzen, hockt er direkt hinter dem Wicket (s. Bild).
Er ist daher nicht mit einem Torwart im Fußball vergleichbar, weil er nicht die Aufgabe hat, das Wicket zu schützen.

Profile
With a physique and attitude that is reminiscent of a young Javagal Srinath, Ishant Sharma shot into prominence during the 2007-08 Test series in Australia. Standing at 6'4", his rhythmic, high-arm action allowed him to bowl at around 140 kph. For one who started serious cricket at 14, his rise was rapid and he made his Ranji Trophy debut at 18. An injury to Munaf Patel provided him an opening during India's tour of Bangladesh in May 2007 but it was in Australia where he caught the attention, prompting Steve Waugh to call him the next best thing in Indian cricket. He showed he could move the ball both ways and his probing spell in the second innings in Perth, where he set-up Ricky Ponting, is the stuff of folklore. He continued to impress in the one-day series, clocking more than 150kph once, and ended as India's highest wicket-taker in the triumphant campaign.
The glory days continued through his debut season, with a notable performance against South Africa, followed by 15 wickets in four Tests in the succesful home series against Australia in 2008, and a couple of strong shows in Sri Lanka in ODIs. By now Ishant was clearly Zaheer Khan's deputy in the Indian seam arsenal, but things have gone seriously wrong since. Some have blamed it on his being over-bowled, particularly on flat tracks in the IPL, while others point to a malaise that has afflicted all of India's new crop of fast bowlers. The fact remains that Ishant lost the most crucial aspect of his bowling - his pace. Without it, his natural short-of-a-good-length that had tormented batsmen of Ponting's calibre a season earlier lost its venom. Eventually the loss of pace led to a loss of self-confidence. The Indian selectors decided to be careful and began shielding him from the shorter formats of the game in 2009 in the hope that he would rediscover his zip. His struggle continued but given India's limited seam-bowling resources at the time, Ishant was persisted with, even after an ankle surgery in 2012 that put him out of action for months. When he completed 50 Tests in early 2013 he had among the worst averages for bowlers with 50 Test caps to their name.
Since then Ishant has somewhat revived his Test career. He was impressive on the tour of New Zealand, being the top wicket-taker in Tests with 15 wickets that included two five-wicket hauls. On his next overseas assignment, in England, Ishant was the hero of India's famous win at Lord's when he bounced out the England batsmen with his spell of 7 for 74, helping India to a 1-0 lead in the Test series. It was perhaps one of his best performances for India in whites.
He soon suffered a leg injury and was ruled out for the following two Tests. He did return for the fifth Test but his 4 for 96 was only part of an embarrassing innings defeat for India. He then went back to Australia, the country that had kick-started his career, but he could only manage mediocre performances in the three Tests he was a part of. His landing foot was proving to be a constant irritant to his fitness and the fast bowler picked up another injury, this time to his knee and was ruled out of the ODI tri-series that followed. Ishant failed to recover in time for the World Cup and was replaced by Mohit Sharma.

A Test match between Sri Lanka and England at the SSC Ground, Colombo, March 2001.
In 1899, a combined school cricket team, composed mainly of cricketers from Royal College , S. Thomas' College and Wesley College beat Colts Cricket Club by a one run. A decision was made to form an all-Sinhalese club, and thus Sinhalese Sports Club was founded. The club leased a land in Victoria Park with sandy soil and covered with cinnamon trees. [1]

In reply, India reached a dominant score of 267/4 with Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh sharing a partnership of 128 runs before England bowler Stuart Broad took a hat-trick , dismissing MS Dhoni (caught Anderson), Harbhajan Singh (lbw) and Praveen Kumar (bowled) and finished with his best Test figures to date, with 6 for 46.

Jedes Team hat stets nur einen Wicket-Keeper in seiner Aufstellung. Es handelt sich um eine stark spezialisierte Aufgabe, die intensiv trainiert werden muss.
In den letzten Jahrzehnten wird allerdings zunehmend vom Wicket-Keeper erwartet, dass er auch über hinreichende Fähigkeiten als Batsman verfügt. Dies gilt in besonderem Maße für One-Day Internationals . Dort kommen nicht selten Wicket-Keeper/Batsmen zum Einsatz, deren Fähigkeiten als Wicket-Keeper geringfügig schwächer als diejenigen eines reinen Wicket-Keepers sind, die dafür jedoch besondere Stärken als Batsman haben.
Als Werfer ( Bowler ) wird der Wicket-Keeper nur in ganz seltenen Ausnahmefällen eingesetzt, weil dann ein anderer Feldspieler seine Aufgaben übernehmen muss.
Demgegenüber kommt es durchaus vor, dass ein Wicket-Keeper die Aufgabe des Kapitäns übernimmt, dem beim Cricket während des Fieldings besondere Bedeutung zukommt. Da er bei jedem Wurf beteiligt ist, hat der Wicket-Keeper in aller Regel eine besondere Spielübersicht, die ihm dabei zugutekommt.
Berühmte Wicket-Keeper[ Bearbeiten ]
Der bekannteste Wicket-Keeper ist Adam Gilchrist , der nicht nur Wicket-Keeper, sondern bis Anfang 2008 auch Startschlagmann (Opening Batsman) des australischen Nationalteams war. Auch der Wicket-Keeper der pakistanischen Nationalmannschaft, Kamran Akmal , ist ein guter Batsman. Der südafrikanische Wicket-Keeper Mark Boucher galt demgegenüber eher als Spezialist.
Berühmte Wicket-Keeper, die inzwischen ihren Rücktritt vom aktiven Sport erklärt haben, sind Ian Healy (Australien), Rod Marsh (Australien), Jeffrey Dujon (West Indies) und Alan Knott (England).

Personal life and early cricket[ edit ]
Born in South Africa, BJ Watling's family moved to New Zealand when he was 10 years old. While at Hamilton Boys' High School Watling was coached by former Test cricketer Chris Kuggeleijn . [1] During his time at school, Watling won the Gillette Cup twice and he played in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2004. One of his greatest achievements at Hamilton Boys' High School was contributing to a 200 + run partnership with Daniel Boughtwood which remains a 1st XI record. Watling also scored 378 in the 2008 Hamilton senior club final, for Hamilton Old Boys against Eastern Suburbs.
Career[ edit ]
Watling made his first-class debut for Northern Districts against Auckland on 6 December 2004 in the State Championship . Playing as a wicket-keeper he scored 37 in the first innings while batting number eight, but in the second innings was promoted to open the batting with Nick Horsley and was dismissed for one run. [2] In his first two first-class for Northern Districts Watling played as a wicket-keeper, but the team wanted him to play as an opening batsman instead and 'keeping fell by the wayside. [3] Later in December Watling made his List A debut against Wellington in the State Shield . He opened the batting with Llorne Howell and was dismissed second ball without scoring a run. [4]
International[ edit ]
He was selected in New Zealand's squad to play a One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International series against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in October and November 2009. Although he was not selected in the ODI series, which New Zealand won 2–1, he made his international debut when he kept wicket in the first Twenty20 International in Dubai, which New Zealand lost by 49 runs. [5] After showing strong form for the Knights in domestic cricket, Watling replaced Peter Fulton in New Zealand's squad for the third Test against Pakistan in December 2009. [6] Watling opened with Tim McIntosh and they provided some uncharacteristic stability to New Zealand's opening partnership. Watling, however, was out caught after an opening stand of 60 runs. In the second innings, Watling hit an unbeaten, quickfire 60 runs from 62 balls, his first half century in Test cricket. Watling and McIntosh made an opening stand of 90 before rain ended play and any New Zealand hopes of victory.
On 13 August 2010 Watling made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in the 2010 Triangular series . He opened the batting and top-scored for New Zealand with 55 runs from 68 deliveries in a three-wicket defeat. [7]
When Zimbabwe toured New Zealand in January 2012, incumbent wicket-keeper Reece Young was dropped because he did not score enough runs in the previous Test against Australia. Watling and Kruger van Wyk were the front runners for the position, [8] and Watling was eventually given the gloves for the one-off Test. His first six Tests were as a specialist batsman. [9] Though he had kept wicket in both the T20Is he had played and two ODIs, at the time Watling had kept wicket in just two first-class matches, both of which were in 2004. [3] New Zealand won the Test by an innings and Watling scored his first Test century, making 102 runs in the first innings. [10] On his return to the domestic circuit with Northern Districts, Watling assumed the role of wicket-keeper to gain more experience. [11] A hip injury prevent Watling from participating in the first Test against South Africa in March, and he was replaced by Kruger van Wyk . [12]
On 16–17 February 2014 Watling scored 124 runs against India. His 352 run partnership with New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum was at the time the highest sixth wicket stand in test cricket history. [13]
The record was surpassed on 5–6 January 2015 by Watling and Kane Williamson with an unbroken 365 run partnership before a declaration against Sri Lanka at Wellington's Basin Reserve. Both players posted their highest test scores, with Williamson not out on 242 and Watling not out on 142. Watling has also been involved in three of the six highest 200+ run 6th-wicket partnerships in the team's history.
In 2015, he became stand-in captain for Black Caps for the tour against England while many players are still fulfilling his duties in the Indian Premier League .
During the first test against England, he suffered an injury that stopped him from keeping behind the wickets in the second innings and most of the first innings on the field, and was moved to the outfield. His gloves were given to Tom Latham . In the second test, playing as a no. 8 batsman only, with Luke Ronchi making his test debut behind the wickets, he became the first New Zealand player to ever score a century at Headingley .
Playing style[ edit ]
According to Watling he consciously modeled his batting on that of South African international Jonty Rhodes : "He wasn't the biggest hitter, more an accumulator. He hit well to the gaps and ran well between wickets. It's kind of how I like to play, or at least develop my game to be like." [1]

Domestic career[ edit ]
On 2 March 2008, before facing England for the test series, McCullum was involved in the State Shield Final versus the Auckland Aces , scoring 170 runs for the Otago Volts to help beat the Aces at Eden Park 's outer oval, and helped to chase down a daunting total of 7 for 310, he broke multiple State Shield batting records.
State Shield (One Day) (off 52 balls), including 14 fours and 5 sixes.
When he got to 135, he scored the highest individual runs for an Otago Volts player.
When he got to 162, he scored the highest score by any player in a domestic one-day match (Shell or State competitions) overtaking Blair Hartland 's previous record.
He went on to score 170 runs, including 19 fours and 7 sixes.
McCullum played for Glamorgan in 2006 and he scored 160 opening the batting against Leicestershire in the County Championship.
On 24 January 2009, he lined up for New South Wales in the final of Australia's KFC Twenty20 Big Bash. This was an exercise to allow him to be eligible to play for them in the Twenty20 Champions League. This sparked criticism however despite opinion States are permitted to have one overseas player in their squad. McCullum also donated his match fee from the game to Otago Junior Cricket.
On 16 January 2010 during the 2009-10 HRV Cup , vs Auckland Aces at University Oval , McCullum hit 108 not out off 67 deliveries, which included 10 fours and four sixes to lead Otago Volts to victory with three balls to spare. McCullum reached his 50 off 32 deliveries and his century off 65 deliveries.

In 2003 he played in a Test series against England and scored what was then his highest score, an innings of 96 at Lord's . His maiden Test century came several months later when he scored 143 against Bangladesh . He fell just short of his second Test hundred in a game against Sri Lanka when dismissed one short of his hundred. His second century would later come with a run a ball 111 against Zimbabwe .
He was selected in the 20-man ICC World XI squad for the ICC Super Series in July 2005.
On 20 February 2007, he scored 86 not out as New Zealand went on to be the first team to whitewash Australia in a three-match ODI series since 1997. During the innings he partnered with Craig McMillan to score 165, equalling the world record for a 6th wicket partnership. [8]
On 31 December 2007 he scored 50 from just 19 balls against Bangladesh. He finished his innings with 80 runs from only 28 balls, including 9 fours and 6 sixes with a strike rate of 285.71.
On 18 April 2008, he achieved the highest Twenty20 individual score in an innings. [9] This eclipsed the previous record mark of 141, held by Australian Cameron White . Coincidentally, McCullum faced an over from White during the match and scored 24 from it; it was White's only over in that match. [10] This record was eventually broken by Chris Gayle when he piled on 175 runs in IPL 2013. In the same match he also claimed the record for most sixes (13) in a Twenty20 innings, [11] which was later surpassed by Englishman Graham Napier (16).
He was bought by Kochi Tuskers Kerala in the 2011 IPL auctions. He returned to the Knight Riders in 2012. In the 2014 IPL auctions, McCullum was bought by Chennai Super Kings . He was given the role of opening the innings along with West Indian Dwayne Smith and the pair was considered as the most dangerous opening pair in the league's history.
Captaincy to present[ edit ]

On 5 April 2009, on day three of the third Test match during India's tour of New Zealand , he displayed an amazing level of alertness in the dismissal of Rahul Dravid . Dravid attempted a sweep shot off Daniel Vettori 's bowling, but McCullum saw what Dravid was up to before the ball had even pitched and moved swiftly to his left (Dravid's leg side). Ross Taylor at first slip did the same. The ball came nicely off Dravid's bat, but flew straight into the hands of a waiting Brendon McCullum. [12] A couple of balls earlier, McCullum tried the same thing, but he had been a little slow and Dravid's sweep was kept low. Although there has been some discussion regarding the legality of McCullum's movement before the ball had even pitched, the laws of cricket indicate he was well within his right to do so. [13]
On 6 November 2009, vs Pakistan at Abu Dhabi, McCullum scored his second ODI century (131, 129 balls, 14 fours, 3 sixes) to elevate New Zealand to 303 and win the match to level the series. [14]
On 16 February 2010, during the only Test match against Bangladesh , he scored 185, the highest score ever by a New Zealand wicket-keeper in Test cricket. He was also involved in the record highest sixth-wicket partnership for New Zealand of 339 runs with Martin Guptill , missing out on the world record by just 12 runs.
On 27 February 2010, becomes just the second player to score a T20I hundred , finishing 116 not out, one run short of Chris Gayle 's record of 117.
On 4 May 2010 McCullum became the first player to score 1000 T20 international runs. He achieved this feat playing against Zimbabwe in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 at Guyana On 28 June 2010, Brendon McCullum said he will not keep wicket for New Zealand in Test matches. He, however informed that he will still keep in 50-overs & T20 over games. [15] This meant that McCullum would have to cement his place in the test team as a batsman. He did a fine job in his first innings since handing over the Wicket-keeping duties he scored 65 runs and was engaged in a 104 run partnership with Ross Taylor he was promoted to the position of opener in tests rather than his usual number 5 position. McCullum did however have experience of opening the innings because he opens for New Zealand in limited-overs cricket. [16]
On 21 September 2012 at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka, McCullum scored 123 runs against Bangladesh at Pallekele , setting a new record for the highest Twenty20 International innings, and becoming the first player to score two Twenty20 International centuries . This record was broken by Aaron Finch on the 29th of August against England, when he scored 156. However McCullum still remains the only player to have scored two Twenty20 International centuries. [4]
Between 16 and 18 February 2014 at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, McCullum scored 302 runs in the third innings of the second test against India, becoming the first New Zealand batsman to score a triple-century . He shared a 352 run partnership with BJ Watling , a record sixth wicket stand , [17] rescuing New Zealand from a likely innings defeat. McCullum closed the innings at 680/8d, both the highest ever innings by New Zealand, and the highest ever third innings in Test cricket history. [17] [18]
On 21 November 2014, McCullum recorded his first ever wicket at test level, a caught-and-bowled of Pakistan's Sarfraz Ahmed during their second test.
On 29 November 2014, McCullum scored a century on day 2 of the third test against the same opposition, in which both teams decided to call off play on the day before as a tribute to Phillip Hughes , and hand-written P.H. under each player's squad number as a further mark of respect. He was bowled out on 202 after hitting ten sixes in his innings, by far a record for New Zealand opening batsman. [19] Two years after his debut as NZ captain, in which the team was bowled out for a paltry 45, Black Caps returned to respectability.
On 13 December 2014, McCullum was named New Zealander of the Year by the New Zealand Herald beating out stiff competition from Lane Pilkington due to his continued co-operation with ICC over the match-fixing scandal which resulted in Chris Cairns being charged for lying to court, and also for changing the perception of the Black Caps as easy-beats. [20] [21]
On the first day of the Boxing Day Test at Hagley Oval , McCullum scored 195 in the first innings against Sri Lanka, which gave him 1000 test runs in a calendar year, becoming the first New Zealander to reach this milestone (1164 at the end of the match, with Kane Williamson at 929), [22] and the fastest test century (in 74 balls), beating his own record against Pakistan in Sharjah. [23] He fell 5 runs shy of his 4th 200+ scores in a calendar year. His 33 sixes in test cricket in a single calendar year is also a world record. [23] It is also worth noting that New Zealand only played 9 test matches in 2014. [23] He also helped to push New Zealand to score 429/7 on day one, the most runs New Zealand had ever scored in a single day of play in test cricket. [23] It ended with an 8-wicket win, which made it 5 test wins out of 9 in 2014, the most wins in a calendar year. He also closed the year with a triple century and two double centuries, the third person to do so after Donald Bradman and Michael Clarke .
On 3 January 2015, McCullum returned to Basin Reserve, where he scored his triple century against India. While he got a 2-ball duck on a green pitch and three errors as a fielder, he was given a key to Wellington, a symbolic equivalent of "Honourary Citizen", joining Wellington-born Sir Peter Jackson and Sir Richard Taylor for their works on Lord of The Rings as the third person to receive such eaks, which were deemed illegal right from the start, and so he started to keep wicket for his school.
Russell was involved in a number of controversial Test selections. He was frequently passed over in favour of Alec Stewart on account of the latter's superior batting ability. Russell, however, was a great wicket-keeper, [4] and could also be an unorthodox but resolute lower-order batsman. In 1990, he was one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year, with Wisden stating:
At the beginning of 1989, Jack Russell had played only one Test for England, and was not considered a good-enough batsman to merit a place in the one-day squad to face the Australians. By the end of the year, he was the only Englishman who could justifiably expect a place in anyone's World XI. [5]
It was his batting that got the fans on their feet – not the high scores, but the determination to stay and grit it out against the Australians. So, with mentor Alan Knott , Russell turned up early for the second Test at Lord's, and for twenty minutes had the MCC ground staff boys throw plastic balls at him – without Russell batting a stroke, just ducking and diving to miss the short deliveries. That day, he also adopted some suitably pungent language in response to the Aussies' sledging, and after he had scored 64 not out, the Aussies never tried it on him again. [5] In the third Test at Edgbaston, he scored 42, the second highest score of the first innings. But his greatest achievement was to come in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, where in the summer of the South African cricket rebels and near-certain defeat, for six hours he held up Aussie celebrations by scoring his highest-ever score in cricket, 128 not out, to almost save the Test for England. It was also his maiden century in all forms of cricket, an achievement only matched by one other Englishman in the twentieth century - Billy Griffith against West Indies in 1947–48 – but it was largely forgotten in the furore of the South African debacle, and the loss of the series. Russell finished the Ashes series as England's third-most-successful batsman, with 314 runs and an average of 39.25. [5]
The summer of 1989 gave Russell a run in the England side, but his batting never reached such scoring heights again, and the game was moving forward in a new era: a six-hour stand for 29 was not what was required. For reasons of balance and depth in batting, Alec Stewart often got the gloves ahead of Russell due to his superior batting and increasingly reliable keeping. [6] Russell was sometimes called up when England needed a good man behind the stumps, but slowly he faded away until 1998, when he decided to retire after being left out of that year's Ashes tour squad. [7]
Russell turned himself into part of the hub of Gloucestershire's one-day success, [8] and together with captain Mark Alleyne won a couple of ODI caps. In 2002, he set a world record when conceding no byes in Northamptonshire's mammoth 746–9 declared. [9] After an inconsistent season due to persistent back problems, he retired from county cricket in 2004, just short of the age of 41. [10] [11] [12]

(August 2015)
Russell was never seen as much of a team player,[ citation needed ] a perception reinforced by his being a loner off the field, his painting, and his protective attitude to his family life. [12] None of his Gloucestershire team-mates were ever invited to his home, and he claimed if they ever asked he would be more than willing if they agreed to be blindfolded; the builders who constructed the extension to it were subjected to the same treatment. [12]
His fitness regime included running every day, and while driving between games Russell would be clad in a sleeping bag with the bottom cut out, so as not to get a chill in his back and legs. He also had a block fitted beneath the accelerator, so as to avoid over-stretching the Achilles tendon . [10]
As can happen to many cricketers, if their era coincides with others who are as good, they are susceptible to whatever selection policies prevail. Jack Russell vied for many years with Alec Stewart for one place. Stewart, a superb player of quick bowling, often struggled against spin. This debate of whether Stewart (inferior to Russell with the gloves but a far superior batsman – especially against quicks) versus Russells's better glovework but lack of results against quick bowling raged from around 1990–1997. When England finally realised that Stewart's best position was opening and not keeping in 1998, Russell was 35. On that tour of the West Indies in 1998, Stewart opened the batting with some success, but Russell endured a poor (for him) match in Guyana, crucially dropping Dinanath Ramnarine . With Stewart being made captain immediately after this tour, the writing was on the wall for Russell, as Stewart batted at 3, kept wicket, and captained the side from 1998–1999. The selectors signalled the end of Russell's international career in 1998–1999 when they selected Warren Hegg as Stewart's deputy.
Some of his more notable oddities included a diet to supplement his extreme fitness regime, which consisted largely of tea, biscuits, and baked beans. Like his mentor, Alan Knott, a heavy tea drinker, Russell would often get through 20 cups a day. He used to dip the tea bag in once, add plenty of milk, then hang it on a nail ready for subsequent use. In the final Test of the 1989 Ashes series (against Australia) at the Oval, Derek Randall counted that he used the same bag for all five days, which roughly equates to 100 cups. [13] For lunch, Russell would eat two Weetabix , soaked for exactly eight minutes in milk, and a mashed banana. For dinner, steak and chips or chicken without skin was a favourite meal – Russell once spent every night of a Test at a Chinese restaurant in Perth , ordering cashew chicken: without the cashews. [12]
He also insisted on always wearing the same battered old flowerpot sunhat during his time out in the field, a constant companion from his debut in 1981 to his last game in 2004. [12] Russell lined up the ball with the specially cut back rim, but it ended up rather worn out. Only his wife Aileen was allowed to repair it, while Russell carried an emergency repair kit of cotton thread and rubber. [12] Its state of age and hence apparent disrepair caused more than one argument with the authorities. Russell refused to wear the official coloured one-day sunhat in South Africa, with a compromise only reached when Russell agreed to wear his old flowerpot hat inside the new sun hat. [10] [13] On a second occasion in the West Indies, he agreed to wash it, and placed it to dry in an oven. Forgotten and resultantly overbaked, the hat caught fire, and was only just rescued from total incineration – the top collapsed like puff pastry on removal. [12] The fire damage could still be seen on the hat years later.
Another eccentricity was his trademark black wicket-keeping gloves. These were falling to pieces, but when he was advised to get new ones, he simply claimed that the old ones gave him a better feel for the ball.[ citation needed ] Allegedly, the gloves were originally owned by Russell, and then given away to a fan. When his previous gloves finally fell to bits. Russell managed to track down where the other gloves were. The fan had left them in a garage, and was only too pleased to donate them back to the eccentric wicket-keeper.[ citation needed ]
Russell has stated his desire that his hands be amputated after his death, and preserved in formaldehyde . [10]
When Russell was on tour in India, sharing a room with Craig White, he would wash his underwear, white y-fronts, and leave them to steam on the bed-side lamp.

Robert James Parks (born 15 June 1959, in Cuckfield ) is a former English cricketer who played for Hampshire and Kent . He is the grandson of Jim Parks senior and son of Jim Parks junior . A wicketkeeper, Parks kept wicket for England during a Test against New Zealand at Lord's in 1986 as a substitute for Bruce French . In 1998 he was named the coach of the France national cricket team .



Overview[ edit ]
A substitute can act for the injured or ill player in the field, although he may not bowl, bat, or act as wicket-keeper or as captain, unless otherwise agreed by the captains . A famous example is the 1986 Test between England and New Zealand at Lords, [1] where England used 4 different wicketkeepers due to injury to their original wicketkeeper. (But see "Tactical substitute" below.). A player may bat, bowl and field even if he has had a substitute for part of the game.
A substitute is permitted to take catches as with any other player, and on some occasions does. The first occasion in Test cricket was in the Test between England and Australia in 1884 , [2] when Australia's captain, Billy Murdoch , took a catch from his teammate Tup Scott while playing as a substitute for England.
In recent years, there have been arguments made for cricket to allow substitutes in First Class games, as cricket remains unique amongst team sports in not permitting full substitutes for either injuries or tactical reasons. Arguments in favour have been made from a perspective of improving the game, [3] coping with increasing injury rates due to the modern schedule, [4] to follow the lead of other sports in trying to manage concussion more responsibly [5] and to provide greater opportunities for players to gain experience in First Class cricket. [6] However, there is an equally strong viewpoint that the nature of the First Class contest may be diminished [7] with a summary suggesting that although medical experts would recommend introduction of substitutes the majority of players are still not in favour. [8]
Retired hurt (or not out)[ edit ]
If a batsman is injured or falls ill while batting, he may retire and resume his innings at the dismissal or retirement of another batsman. If he cannot return by the end of the innings, the batting side must close its innings after all other batsmen are dismissed (excluding the not-out batsman). This can occur if the batsman requires medical attention away from the ground. It is therefore possible for the side batting last in a match to lose despite only losing nine (or potentially fewer) wickets. For the purposes of calculating a batting average, a scorecard entry of 'Retired, hurt' or 'Retired, ill' is considered not out. [9]
Retired out[ edit ]
In cricket, a batsman retires out if he retires without the umpire's permission, and does not have the permission of the opposing captain to resume his innings. This occasionally happens in friendly or practice matches, for instance English county sides against University Centres of Cricketing Excellence. Although it is not considered to be a dismissal in the context of a cricket match, it is considered a dismissal for the purposes of calculating a batting average.
Only two batsmen have retired out in an international cricket Test match . Both instances occurred in the same match, with the Sri Lankan batsmen Marvan Atapattu and Mahela Jayawardene . [10]
Restrictions on injured fielder[ edit ]
When a player leaves the ground due to injury and is replaced by a substitute fielder, he/she is generally not permitted to return and immediately resume bowling (or batting if their team's innings commences while they are off the field). The injured player is required to spend a period back on the field at least equal to the time that they were absent before resuming bowling. Variations of the time periods required and the circumstances of the players return to the field apply in different forms of the game. [11]
Tactical substitute[ edit ]
In 2005, the International Cricket Council announced, as part of a package of changes to the playing conditions for One Day Internationals to be trialled over a ten-month period, that football -style tactical substitutions would be permitted. Each team was to be allowed one substitute, who had to be named before the toss was made, and could be introduced at any stage of the match. The NatWest Challenge series between England and Australia in July saw the first use of these new regulations, which did not apply to other forms of cricket such as Test matches .
This change, however, was widely criticised by players, commentators, and fans. In particular, it was said to give the team that wins the toss an even greater advantage than usual. [12]
In March 2006 players and officials started to rebel against this controversial rule and a One Day International series between South Africa and Australia saw the players agree to boycott the rule. Just a few weeks later the International Cricket Council announced that the rule was being withdrawn, and it is no longer used.
In the Ashes test series of 2005, Ricky Ponting complained about what he regarded as the tactical substitution of specialist fielders for weaker bowlers in the English team, which he argued was against the spirit of cricket. English bowlers were frequently substituted at the end of bowling spells and replaced with fresh fielders. The English coach argued that these substitutions were either legitimate injuries or players "answering the call of nature". Ponting was fined 75% of his match fee for dissent after being run out by a substitute fielder during the fourth test . [13] In 2008 the International Cricket Council tightened the regulations on the use of substitutions, saying "Substitute fielders shall only be permitted in cases of injury, illness or other wholly acceptable reasons...and should not include what is commonly referred to as a 'comfort break'" [14]



History[ edit ]
The third umpire was conceptualized by former Sri Lankan Test cricketer, and current cricket writer Mahinda Wijesinghe [1] and debuted in Test cricket in November 1992 at Kingsmead , Durban for the South Africa vs. India series. Karl Liebenberg was the third umpire with Cyril Mitchley the on-field umpire, referring the run-out decision in this match. Sachin Tendulkar became the first batsman to be dismissed ( run out ) by using television replays in the second day of the Test scoring 11. [2]
Functions[ edit ]
In the case of a run out or stumping, a batsman may be declared "out" if the wicket is 'put down'. The wicket is down if a bail is removed from the top of the stumps or a wicket is struck out of the ground, whether by the ball, the bat or the striker's person. If the batsman is caught between the two popping creases and the wicket is put down, the batsman is declared out. In most cases, the event occurs in a fraction of a second. If the field umpires are unable to accurately come to a decision on the dismissal of a batsman, the umpire requests the third umpire to ascertain whether the batsman had made it home. The third umpire then looks at various TV replays from different angles and comes to a conclusion by pressing the appropriate signal. Originally decisions were conveyed in traffic light style (a red light indicating a batsman's dismissal, a green light not out); it is now common practice to display the decision via the large screen scoreboard, if available. If the umpire is unsure if a batsman is out or not, due to lack of conclusive evidence, the usual procedure is to acquit the batsman, known in cricketing parlance as "the benefit of the doubt".
The third umpire may also be called upon if the on-field umpire cannot decide which batsman is out (i.e. they end up at the same end). An example of this was the Third Test between New Zealand and the West Indies in 2006. [3]
A batsman is caught out if a fielder catches the ball on the fly. In some cases the fielder may catch the ball a few inches above ground level. If the umpire's vision is obscured or is unsure if the ball bounced before the fielder cau Worcestershire, while sitting waiting for the rain to stop, he walked into town and bought a sketch-pad and some pencils. [14]
“
If Rembrandt can do it, then why can't I...?'. That first day, I strolled along the Severn at the back of the ground, but I was so shy that whenever someone came along, I'd hide the sketch-pad.
”
When England toured Pakistan in 1987, Russell had two days' cricket in a six-week tour, so kept his mind sane through sketching and photography. On return to the UK, he displayed 40 sketches in a gallery in Bristol, which sold out in two days. [14]
Russell now has his own gallery in Chipping Sodbury , and exhibits in London, displaying a portfolio of sights and scenes of his home area in Gloucestershire, architecture, classic military battlefields, and wildlife. Russell also undertakes commissions, and has painted comedian Eric Sykes (a fellow wicket keeper), Sir Norman Wisdom , Sir Bobby Charlton , Eric Clapton , Henry Allingham , and HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh . [14] He states that his style shows influences of impressionism and pointillism . [15]
Post-retirement[ edit ]
From his retirement, Russell has been a full-time artist. [14] In 2009, to celebrate the first high-definition television transmission of the Ashes series, Russell was commissioned by BSkyB to hand-paint five Sky+ HD digiboxes . [16]
In 2007, Russell was appointed goal-keeping coach for football team Forest Green Rovers who play in the Conference National . [17] After his mentorship from Alan Knott throughout his own career, Russell later provided one-to-one coaching for Arfo maverick Geraint Jones .[ citation needed ] [18] He also provided coaching and mentorship at Gloucestershire in 2008.

Career[ edit ]
Latif started playing for the Pakistan national cricket team in 1992 after the 1992 Cricket World Cup . He impressed the national selectors by scoring 50 runs in his Test debut, however it did not cement his place in the national squad as throughout his career he had to compete with another Pakistani wicket-keeper, Moin Khan . This led to frequent changes of wicket keepers in the next decade. In 1996, he announced his retirement after conflicts with some players and the team management. He returned to the Pakistan team and became the captain of the National side in 1998.
Latif remained out of the national squad until 2001, when after a string of poor performances, the Pakistan team replaced Moin Khan . After returning into the squad, he secured his place by keeping the wicket and giving a string of good batting performances. The highlight of his career came after the 2003 Cricket World Cup , when he was announced the captain of the Pakistan team. Under his leadership, Pakistan successfully experimented with several new players and the team gave positive results. He was also involved with uniting the players through his captaincy in both on and off the cricket field. However, problems between Latif and the team management again surfaced in 2003–2004, which resulted in him giving away the captaincy to former Pakistan batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq . He was omitted from the squad and since then has never been recalled in the team, despite his attempts to get back into the squad during 2003–2005.
In April 2006, Latif retired from First class cricket as he toured with the Pakistani senior players to play against Indian senior players in April 2006 in a series played between players who have retired from professional cricket. Latif has not participated in domestic first class cricket since 2005. His last match was in 2006, when he played for Lashings cricket club, a club in England.
Coaching career[ edit ]
Latif has notably become batting coach of the Afghanistan National Cricket team . [2] Latif also stated that the Afghan players were keen to learn from him. [3] Latif further added that he liked the challenge of coaching the team and helping at grass-roots level of Afghan cricket; [4] in July 2010 he also talked about having a Pakistan-Afghanistan cricket series in late 2010 to help Pakistan return to staging international cricket. [5] As a wicket-keeper Latif also commented on the form of Pakistani wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal by stating that "Kamran has gained weight for a wicket-keeper, his wicket-keeping has been poor due to that and a lot of work load as a cricketer. I strongly suggest to all wicket-keepers that when they are struggling they take a rest and then comeback to the scene stronger as poor wicket-keeping can destroy you confidence as a batsman." [6] In August 2010 the coach of the Afghan team Kabir Khan announced that he was going to leave his post because of consistent interference by the board. This led to Latif, who was batting coach at the time, to be named his successor. However just after that Latif announced his resignation also citing consistent interference caused by the board. [7]
In 2010, Latif responded to the spot-fixing allegations against the Pakistan team by saying that ICC needs to re-design its laws and rules to root out the match-fixing and spot-fixing problem. Latif wrote a letter to the ICC citing his concerns back in 2003,"In that letter, I told them to change the rules and laws in one-day internationals which, were more prone to spot-fixing. I even offered to assist the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit but I got no response," he said.
"The key is to design laws and rules that do not allow players and bookmakers to manipulate things. I told the ICC remove the fielding restrictions and they introduced the power-play which only encouraged fixing." [8]
Following this statement Latif resigned from his job as wicket-keeping coach at the Pakistan National Cricket Academy and subsequently reconciled with the Afghan Cricket Board and returned as the team's coach [1] He stated that his aim was to help the team get the status to play Test cricket in two years' time. [9] Latif also stated that he believed that a broad-cast delay of 30 seconds would help curb fixing. [10]
Latif's stint as Afghan coach got off to a good start when Afghanistan registered a 162-run win over Kenya in the ICC Intercontinental Cup but then lost the first ODI by 92 runs as Kenya were bowled out for 160. But then Afghanistan's batting order collapsed for 88. The team took a six-wicket victory during the second ODI as Kenya succumbed to 139 and Afghanistan suffered a poor start with opener Noor Ali retiring hurt and Karim Sadiq being caught. However Asghar Stanikzai scored his second half-century and along with Mohammad Shahzad who scored 37 guided the run chase. [11] The finest moment of Latif's coaching career came at the 2010 Asian Games when Afghanistan upset the cricket super-power Pakistan in the semi-final as Afghanistan sealed a comfortable 22-run victory and set up a final tie with Bangladesh. [12] However Afghanistan lost the final but the celebrated accomplishment was that the Afghanistan collected their first ever Asian games medal with a second-place silver.
Latif's team next assignment was the ICC Intercontinental Cup and Afghanistan play Scotland in the final. Latif stated that Afghanistan likes to play aggressive cricket and that the players are mentally very tough and hate to lose. [13] On 2 December the match against Scotland started and because of Hamid Hassan Scotland were bowled out for 212. More than half of Scotland's runs came from Neil McCallum who scored 104*. Afghanistan got off to a good start but collapsed to 171 all out, giving Scotland a 41-run lead. Despite this another great bowling performance from Hassan and Samiullah Shenwari meant that Scotland were skittled for just 82 in their second innings. On the third day Afghanistan sealed victory early in the day with seven-wickets in hand courtesy of a superb 56* by Mohammad Shahzad . [14]

England won by 2 runs
Umpires: BF Bowden (NZ) and RE Koertzen (SA)
Player of the match: A Flintoff (Eng)
Australia won the toss and elected to field.
The psychological battles before the match included many Australian statements to the press about how the pitch "played into [their] hands", [19] that England had been "spending too much time talking", [20] and that their top order had been "taking bad options". [21] England kept quieter, until just before the game stories appeared about how the Edgbaston game would be decided at the toss: whichever side won it would choose to bowl first and would win, as had happened in 12 of the 13 Tests at Edgbaston since 1991 . [22] England came out on top in the mind game after Ricky Ponting won the toss and put England in to bat; Jonathan Agnew of the BBC claimed "it was clear that his decision had backfired" once England started batting. [23]
England took advantage of being inserted and came back strongly, becoming the first team to hit 400 runs in a first day of Test cricket against Australia since 1938 . [24] The English scored at a pace above four an over in their opening partnership, helped by the freak injury that Glenn McGrath sustained before the match; during a warm-up (playing rugby ), the paceman accidentally stood on a cricket ball, tearing ankle ligaments. [25] Australia had to field Michael Kasprowicz as replacement, and missed McGrath's superior control and wicket-taking abilities in the match.
The English innings began with Marcus Trescothick hitting nine boundaries off Brett Lee , while Andrew Strauss preferred Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz . [26] Their 112-run partnership was the highest by England in the series thus far; the Australians had only surpassed that once, through Damien Martyn and Michael Clarke 's 155 at Lord's . To add to Australia's woes, Trescothick was caught off a no-ball on 32, [27] and eventually went on to make 90, being the second man out shortly after lunch, with the score 164 for 2 after 32.3 overs.
In the next five overs, England lost both Ian Bell , who notched up his third successive single-figure score, and Michael Vaughan , who pulled a short Gillespie delivery to the hands of Lee , but that did little to slow the scoring rate. 132 runs had been taken in the morning session; the afternoon yielded 157. Kevin Pietersen , in his second Test match, hit ten fours and one six, and made a 103-run partnership in 105 balls with Andrew Flintoff . [28] Flintoff's 68 was scored off 62 balls, and Lee's 18 balls were taken for 26 runs, including two sixes. [26]
Lee bowled 17 overs, and conceded 111 runs, but got the one wicket of Pietersen , who pulled to Simon Katich for 71 off 76 balls, and with the score on 342 for 7 with 24 scheduled overs remaining in the day. Then, Steve Harmison smacked two fours and a six in a 15-minute 17, and Simon Jones stuck around with Matthew Hoggard for a last-wicket partnership of 32, Jones making 19 not out . Shane Warne finally got the better of Hoggard, to end with four for 116, but by that time England had gone past 400 and ended up with a total of 407 in just under 80 overs. Just as Australia's opening batsman walked out and prepared for their innings, the rain began to fall on Edgbaston, and play had to be stopped. [27]
England's total could have been significantly higher with a bit more top-order application, especially given the high scoring rate. However, England's bowlers started well when Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer , and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's Test career. [29] Then, Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, before the umpire 's finger went up twice more before lunch; Ricky Ponting swept a shot off Ashley Giles to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a single for 20. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, hitting 76 runs in an hour and a half, but a couple of wickets within five overs took Australia to 208 for 5, needing 199 for the last five wickets for parity. The partnership between Langer and Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss, as Langer continued his four-hour unbeaten knock and went into the tea break on 72.
The pair looked to close England's lead and batted unbeaten after tea for eight overs, but again the England bowlers intervened, this time in the shape of Simon Jones , who got plenty of reverse swing both ways [30] and used that to trap Langer with a yorker – gone for 82, which was to be Australia's highest score in the innings. Australia's last four, which now included Michael Kasprowicz who had a batting average 10 runs higher than McGrath , were nevertheless all dismissed for single-figure scores, Flintoff taking the two last men LBW with the two last balls, although there was some argument about whether the first dismissal, that of Gillespie, was actually out or not. [30] Meanwhile, Ashley Giles ' return of three for 78, including Ponting, Clarke and Warne, was to be his best bowling figures all series. [31]
However, England got their 99-run lead and continued to build their lead before stumps were drawn. After Trescothick and Strauss had hit five boundaries in six overs and taken the second innings total to 25 for 0, [32] Ponting brought on Warne in the seventh over, and Warne broke through with his second ball of the innings; his leg break came into the left-hander's stumps and broke them completely, and Strauss was bowled for 6. Nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard survived four balls to end the day, when England held a lead of 124 runs, with nine wickets in hand.
The third day saw a total of 17 wickets fall, with Shane Warne and Andrew Flintoff being the leading performers for their sides. First up, Brett Lee grabbed three wickets in 12 minutes: Trescothick slashed a wide delivery and got an edge to the keeper, captain Vaughan got his third single-figure score in the series as he failed to cover his stumps to a straight one, and nightwatchman Hoggard edged to Hayden in the slips for 1.
England had lost four wickets for six runs, and were 31 for 4 with Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen at the crease. Pietersen survived what looked like an edge on the first ball he faced, [33] and went on to make 20 before he was given out in a similar situation from Shane Warne . His 41-run partnership with Bell took England's lead past 150, and with Bell having batted past the hour mark, he needed 29 more for his half-century when he gave a tiny edge to Gilchrist .
England's last recognised batting pairing, between Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones , saw England to lunch, but Flintoff had suffered an injury to his left shoulder and looked in obvious pain, [33] and Jones departed shortly after lunch. Giles lasted longer, batting through 45 minutes before he was caught by Hayden , and Harmison faced one delivery to leave England at 131 for 9.
Simon Jones and Flintoff carried on, however. Jones managed 12 runs in his 42-minute stay at the crease while Flintoff took Lee for 33 off the 28 balls he faced from the Australian paceman. [26] Flintoff also took runs off Kasprowicz , with his third over yielding 20 runs for England, including a couple of no balls . At one point during Flintoff's innings, Ponting had nine men on the boundary, with only the bowler and the wicket-keeper inside the circle. However, Flintoff hit a six over them, too, [33] and another of his sixes landed on top of the stands. Flintoff ended with 73, as the only man to pass 25 for England, before he was bowled by Warne. Warne finished with figures of six for 46 from 23.1 overs, having bowled unchanged from the seventh over till the end.
Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer started positively, taking runs off the occasional bad balls that were served up by Harmison , Hoggard and Giles , and by the twelfth over they had racked up 47 for no loss, and were well on the way to chasing the target of 282. Then, Flintoff came and bowled the over of the series. He failed to make the hat-trick he was on from the last innings, but with his second ball he bowled Langer with a leg cutter. His third delivery was narrowly turned down for lbw, the fourth found Ponting's edge but failed to carry to slip, an lbw appeal on the fifth was also turned down, but his sixth which Ponting left outside the offstump was a no ball, so there was a seventh and final delivery, another leg cutter and Ponting was out caught behind. Including the previous innings, Flintoff had taken four wickets in nine balls. But more importantly, Australia had been reduced from 47/0 to 48/2.
Hayden kept going, and his dismissal came in an over where Australia had taken eight runs from the first four balls; however, Simon Jones got the last laugh over Hayden, only to later be reprimanded and fined by the ICC for his celebrations. [34] England kept on the pressure, getting three more wickets before the scheduled close of play; Giles getting two, dismissing Katich and Gilchrist , and an inswinging ball from Flintoff took care of Gillespie , who was trapped lbw.
An extra half-hour of play was allowed, as a result was nearing, but Warne and Clarke defied the English. Warne "took the attacking approach", [33] and took on Giles for 12 in one over. He ended on 20 not out overnight, as Warne and Clarke batted together for 40 minutes before Steve Harmison , bowling his third spell of the day, brought the third day's proceedings to an end with a slow delivery that was not read correctly by Clarke , who missed the ball completely to be bowled . England now needed two wickets on the fourth day, while Australia needed 107 runs for the victory.
England were said to be "on the brink of...victory", [33] but Australia came back thanks to two partnerships worth more than 40 to take themselves within three runs of a 2–0 series lead. First, Warne and Lee added 45 for the ninth wicket, before Warne trod on his own stumps after a full Flintoff ball and was out hit wicket . Kasprowicz came in and supported Lee well, fending off aggressive bowling from Flintoff and Harmison, and Simon Jones dropped Kasprowicz with 15 left to get. [35] With Australia edging towards victory, preferring singles to risky boundaries, England were now bowling aggressive short balls at the tail-enders, hoping for short catches or to surprise the batsmen with a yorker . With four runs needed to win, Lee drove Harmison's attempted yorker towards the boundary where it was fielded. The Australians crossed for a single, leaving three runs to win with the weaker batsman Kasprowicz on strike. Harmison delivered another short ball, which Kasprowicz fended and Jones took an athletic catch down the leg side. England appealed, and Kasprowicz was given out caught by Bowden. However subsequent replays suggested that the ball contacted Kasprowicz's glove while not in contact with the bat handle, rendering Bowden's decision technically incorrect. England were nonetheless declared victors – if in almost the most narrow way possible – and the series was thus tied with three matches left. [36]
Rather than engaging in the victory celebrations, the immediate reaction of Flintoff to the winning dismissal was to console the despondent batsman, Brett Lee  – a gesture which was widely commented upon as indicative of the good sportsmanship and mutual respect between the teams which characterised the series. [37] [38] [39]
England's two run victory was the narrowest result in Ashes cricket history thus far (there had been two Ashes Tests won by a margin of only three runs). It is also the second narrowest run victory in all Test cricket history. [40]

[24] However, the ground witnessed a double century that test by Kumar Sangakkara , a fellow former test wicketkeeper-batsman.
On 20 February 2015, in New Zealand's 3rd Pool A match of the 2015 Cricket World Cup , McCullum scored 77 runs of 25 balls recording the fastest 50 in world cup history (51 runs off 18 balls), and the 4th fastest 50 in ODI history. He also delivered brutal innings against Australia, and South Africa in the semi-final as well. McCullum became the first New Zealand captain to lead his team to the World Cup finals, by putting the six semi-final losses in the past.
McCullum played in the 2015 Cricket World Cup Final , and was bowled for a duck in just the first over of the match by Mitchell Starc , as New Zealand went on to lose to Australia by 7 wickets.
On 21 May 2015, McCullum started in his 93rd consecutive test, and batting in his preferred spot at no. 5.
Role[ edit ]
McCullum originally played in the side as a wicketkeeper -batsman. His glovework improved during his tenure as the New Zealand wicketkeeper. His batting is good enough to earn him selection for the Black Caps alone, shown by the occasions on which he has been unable to keep but has still been selected as a batsman. [25] He opens the batting for New Zealand in ODIs with steadily improving success. He is an aggressive batsman who is particularly strong over extra cover, often lofting the ball into the stands, and also square-cutting, or square-driving the ball. He is also adept at using the scoop shot, even using it at tests, so much so that McScoop was named after him. In 2010 McCullum hung up the gloves In Test cricket due to continued body strain and became a specialist batsmen in Test cricket, opening the innings in his first match as a specialist batsmen against India in Ahmedabad. He was described as a player "especially suited to Twenty20 cricket" when he signed for a five-week stint at Glamorgan in June 2006. [26] The stint included the entire domestic 2006 Twenty20 Cup. He was signed up by the Kolkata Knight Riders of the IPL for $700,000. His contract with the IPL is for three years.
He has the ability to play the Dilscoop , which involves the batsman squatting down and scooping deliveries back over the wicketkeeper's head. Playing this shot in a Twenty20 International match on 28 February 2010 in Lancaster Park , Christchurch, against Australia, he managed to hit Shaun Tait for two sixes in an over back over Brad Haddin 's head. He can also execute reverse sweep well.
During the Twenty20 World Championship in 2009, the wicketkeeping duties was given to Peter McGlashan . He was seen practicing his medium bowling.
McCullum had to decide whether to play for New South Wales, KKR, or Otago in the 1st edition of the Champions League. Since KKR did not qualify, he had only to consider playing for either New South Wales or Otago; eventually he had decided to play for Otago alongside brother Nathan McCullum . [27]
In 2012, BJ Watling became McCullum's replacement as wicketkeeper in Tests, but due to Luke Ronchi 's struggles in ODI's, McCullum still remained as wicketkeeper in ODIs and T20s. But by late 2013, McCullum's recurring back problems meant he can no longer perform wicketkeeping duties effectively, he gave up his gloves to Ronchi in ODIs and T20s, and McCullum became a middle order batsman, or as a cover for opening the batting in tests, having batted at 1,2,5–7 in his career, while his fielding position becomes predominantly mid-off, mid-on or mid-wicket. [28] He is also a very seldomly-used part-time medium pace bowler in tests. He got his first wicket in all forms of international cricket from a caught-and-bowled against Sarfraz Ahmed of Pakistan which ended their first innings in 2014. McCullum was picked for 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup as an opening batsman due to inconsistencies from Martin Guptill and Tom Latham and the emergence of Grant Elliott as a solid option at no. 5 batsman. His role as a pinch hitter saw the team reach their first ever World Cup final. After the World Cup, he returned to his preferred spot at number 5 for test cricket.



Format[ edit ]
The 18 teams are divided into two groups of nine. In the style of a round-robin tournament , each team will play six other teams in their group both home and away. The other two teams will be faced just once. The top four teams from each group qualify for the knockout stage: a three-round single-elimination tournament . The winner of each group will have a home match in the quarter-finals against the fourth team from the other group. The runner-ups from each group will play at home against the third placed team from the other group. The semi-finals will be a free draw from all the qualified teams. [1] Finals Day will be again be held at Edgbaston . [2]

Personal life[ edit ]
Mohammad Mushfiqur Rahim was born on 9 May 1988 to Mahbub Habib and Rahima Khatun. In between playing cricket, Rahim studied history at the Jahangirnagar University .Formerly, He finished his school life from Bogra Zilla School [2] He was due to miss the exams for his master's degree in April 2012 as they clashed with Bangladesh's scheduled tour of Pakistan, [3] however the tour was postponed and Rahim allowed to sit the exams. [4] [5]
Early career[ edit ]
Before playing for the senior national team, Rahim played for Bangladesh Under-19s . He represented them in three Youth Tests and 18 Youth One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 2004 and 2006, averaging 31.75 and 36.00 with the bat in the respective formats. His only half-century in the Tests came against England. [6] [7] Rahim trained at the Bangladesh Institute of Sports. [8]
Mushfiqur was selected for Bangladesh's tour of England in May and June 2005 . In what was Bangladesh's first tour of England, the team faced unfamiliar conditions and the batsmen struggled against seam bowling . Mushfiqur adapted his batting style in the warm up matches, "consistently playing late and straight" according to Wisden , and managed to score 63 against Sussex and a career best 115  not out against Northamptonshire in the warm up matches.
Although initially named in the squad as understudy for the wicket-keeping position, Mushfiqur's performances in the warm up matches led to his selection for the first Test at Lord's as a specialist batsman. The 16-year-old scored 19 in the first innings and was one of just three batsman to reach double figures as Bangladesh were dismissed for 108. After twisting his ankle, Mushfiqur played no further part in the tour. [9]

During the 2006 U-19 Cricket World Cup , hosted by Sri Lanka in February, Rahim captained the Bangladesh side which included future international players Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal among others. Rahim was one of two players at the tournament with Test-match experience. [10] Under his guidance Bangladesh reached the quarter finals of the tournament. [11] Later that month Rahim was recalled to the senior Test squad for the first time since the England tour in 2005. He was selected as a specialist batsmen, with Khaled Mashud chosen as the wicket-keeper for the series against Sri Lanka . [12]
Rahim was included in Bangladesh's senior squad to tour Zimbabwe for five ODIs in July 2006 . He was one of three uncapped ODI players included in the squad alongside all-rounders Farhad Reza and Shakib Al Hasan . [13]
He scored his maiden half-century at Harare against Zimbabwe and was picked as the first-choice wicket-keeper ahead of Mashud for the World Cup in the West Indies . Rahim was chosen because his batting was considered better. [14]
Rahim was recalled for the second Test against Sri Lanka in July 2007 , replacing Mashud as it was felt that Rahim was in better form. [15] Although Banglaυ   Φ φ Χ χ Ψ ψ Ω ω   {{Polytonic|}}

Oliver Benjamin Cox (born 2 February 1992) is an English cricketer who plays county cricket for Worcestershire .
Cox has been associated with Worcestershire for some years, having played at Under-13, Under-15 and Under-17 level, although not originally as a wicket-keeper. [1]
He captained the Under-17 side against Somerset U-17s in July 2009, scoring exactly 100. [2]
Cox was called up to make his first-class debut, aged 17, in Worcestershire's penultimate County Championship match of 2009, against Somerset at Taunton . [3] Withdrawn from his lessons at Bromsgrove School for the occasion, [4] he scored 61 in his only innings of a drawn match (an innings in which Daryl Mitchell scored 298), winnings compliments for an innings that after a slightly nervous start had become one of "great maturity and judgment". [5] Keeping wicket, his first first-class dismissal was that of Marcus Trescothick , stumped for 72. [6] He also took four catches, including a spectacular leg-side dive to dismiss Arul Suppiah . [7]
He was awarded a four-year contract by Worcestershire in October 2009, Director of Cricket Steve Rhodes paying tribute to his performance on debut, saying he showed 'real character'. [8]
Cox pressed his claims for a regular place in the side in his first game of the 2010 season. Batting at number eight in a non-first-class warm-up match against Bradford/Leeds UCCE , he came to the crease with his side struggling at 140 for six; his magnificent 110 was scored off only 138 balls. Worcestershire went on to win the game. [9]
“
We're so chuffed for him, and obviously for the school. Let's hope some other boys can follow in his footsteps and reach the high standard he has so far!
(Justin Abrahams, Head of Boys' PE at Bromsgrove Senior School)

Pakistani Shoaib Akhtar holds the world record for delivering the fastest ball (161.3 km/h). [4]
In the early days of cricket, underarm bowling was the only method employed. Many theories exist about the origins of cricket. One suggests that the game began among shepherds hitting a stone or a ball of wool with their crooks and, at the same time, defending the wicket gate into the sheep-fold (from Anglo Saxon 'cricce', a crooked staff). A second theory suggests the name came from a low stool known as a 'cricket' in England, which from the side looked like the long, low wicket used in the early days odesh lost by an innings and 90 runs, Rahim combined with Mohammad Ashraful  – the new captain – to score a record 191 for Bangladesh's sixth-wicket partnership. [16] [17] Mushfiqur scored 80, beating his previous best score in Tests of 19. [18] In December 2007, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) granted Rahim a one-year grade B (third tier) contract, one of 22 central contracts with the Board at the time. [19]
Following the World Cup, Rahim endured a series of poor scores, including five innings in which he amassed four runs altogether. [20] As a result, when South Africa toured in March for three ODIs and Bangladesh went to Pakistan for five ODIs the next month , Rahim was dropped in favour of Dhiman Ghosh .
Rahim was recalled to the squad for a tri-series with Pakistan and India and the 2008 Asia Cup . [21] When 17 contracts were announced in April 2009, Rahim's was renewed, [22] marking Rahim as Bangladesh's first choice 'keeper.
Vice-captaincy[ edit ]
Rahim was appointed vice-captain for Bangladesh's tour of Zimbabwe in August 2009 . The position was vacated as the previous holder, Shakib Al Hasan , was filling-in as captain for the injured Mashrafe Mortaza . [23] Bangladesh won the five match ODI series4–1, and in the final fixture Rahim scored 98, beating his previous highest score in list A matches of 58, to help his team to victory. [24] [25] With 169 runs in the series at an average of 56.33, Rahim was Bangladesh's fourth-highest run scorer. [26]
Rahim keeping wicket against England at Old Trafford in 2010
Rahim retained the vice-captaincy for the Home Test Series against India in January and February 2010, and on 21 January, the fifth day of the first Test, he scored his maiden Test century and the fastest by a Bangladeshi in Test cricket, off only 112 balls as Bangladesh delayed an Indian victory, being the last man out as India won by 113 runs. [1] England toured Bangladesh in February and March for two Tests and three ODIs. [27] Bangladesh lost all five match. [28] [29]
Rahim at least had a successful series and was his team's second-highest run-scorer in the ODIs and Tests. [30] [31] Rahim scored two half-centuries in the first Test, becoming the 6th Bangladesh batsman to perform the feat. [32]
Having impressed at home, Rahim's performance in the return tour in England in May was expected to be crucial to how well Bangladesh performed. [33] In the event, he could manage just 40 runs from two Tests as Bangladesh's batsmen struggled in English conditions and slumped to a 2–0 defeat. [34] The teams were due to face each other in a three-match ODI series after the Tests. In the first fixture Rahim was struck in the face while keeping wicket to spinner Faisal Hossain . An x-ray revealed no fractures, however as a precaution he was rested for a week, missing the rest of the series. [35]
At the start of November, the BCB announced 16 central contracts. Rahim was one of six players in the top level. [36] Later that month, Rahim recorded his best score in a one-day match. Playing for Rajshahi in the National Cricket League , he scored 114 from 120 deliveries as his team lost by 8 runs. [37] In December 2010, Tamim Iqbal replaced Rahim as Bangladesh's vice-captain. [38]
Rahim was included in Bangladesh's 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup. [39] Bangladesh were knocked out in the group stage and Rahim had a poor tournament personally. There were suggestions that he could be dropped, especially as fellow wicket-keeper Dhiman Ghosh was scoring heavily in Bangladesh's domestic competition. [40] In August 2011, Mushfiqur hit 101 from 100 balls having his second century against Zimbabwe was not enough to stop Bangladesh losing the third one-day series by five runs. [41]
National captain[ edit ]
On 20 September 2011, Rahim was named Bangladesh captain, taking over from Shakib Al Hasan after a disappointing tour of Zimbabwe. The announcement was made midway through the BCB Cup, a tournament involving the senior Bangladesh team, Bangladesh A, and a side made up of academy players. Rahim had already been captaining Bangladesh in the tournament on a temporary basis. [42] The competition was won by Bangladesh A. [43]
Bangladesh's next international engagement was hosting the West Indies in October for a T20I, three ODIs, and two Tests. In his first international match as captain, Rahim produced a Man-of-the-Match performance, scoring 41 not out from 26 balls to help his team to victory with one delivery to spare in the only T20I. [44] Bangladesh lost the ODI series 2–1 and Rahim was his team's leading run-scorer with 100, including an innings of 69. [45] The following month, Pakistan toured for three ODIs and two Tests . Bangladesh lost the ODI series 3–0, and Rahim managed just 12 runs from three innings. [46]
The Bangladesh Cricket Board founded the six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament to be held in February that year. The BCB made Mushfiq the 'icon player' for Duronto Rajshahi . [47] Under his leadership Duronto overcame a weak start to progress to the semi-finals where they lost to Barisal Burners ; Rahim contributed 234 runs from 11 matches. [48]
In the 2012 Asia Cup , under Rahim's captaincy, Bangladesh won two out of the three games they have played and reached the final for the first time where they lost to Pakistan in the final. In April his grade A+ central contract was renewed. [49] On 11 March 2013, during the 1st test of the tour of Sri Lanka in Galle, Rahim became the first Bangledeshi to score a double hundred, beating the previous highest of 190 set by Mohammed Ashraful earlier in the day.[ citation needed ]
Mushfiqur announced his resignation as captain on 8 May 2013, [50] but a few days later Mushfiqur announced he had made a "mistake", and on 3 July 2013 the BCB announced they would be retaining Mushfiqur as captain until the end of the year. [51] Rahim had an outstanding home series against New Zealand in October and November 2013. His team drawn the first two tests, won all three ODIs but lost the only T20 match. [52] [53]
Mushfiqur would continue his captaincy in 2014 and would lost to Sri Lanka in a home series. During the series, he suffered a hand injury for which he was replaced with Anamul Haque in wicket keeping. He also missed out the T20 international matches against Sri Lanka in which Mashrafe Mortaza took the job of captaincy. [54] He scored his second one-day international century against India in the beginning of the 2014 Asia Cup but struggled in that match with his injury. [55] [56] Mushfiqur continued in the next match against Afghanistan but lost the match by 32 runs which was a great shame for him and his team. [57] [58] His team also lost the match against Pakistan in that same tournament even after scoring 326 which was their highest ODI score. [59] Later they lost to Sri Lanka in their last match of the Asia Cup which made them lose all three matches. [60] [61] [62] Bangladesh qualified for the super 10s in the ICC World Twenty20 2014 , by winning two of their three matches. [63] But they were knocked out in the super 10s, having lost all the four matches. [64]
Bangladesh toured the West Indies in August, 2014 , where they lost all three ODIs and two test matches. [65] During the first test, Mushfiqur scored 116 in the second innings, picking up his third test century. [66] On September 2014, BCB appointed Mashrafee Mortaza as the ODI captain while Mushfiqur still remained to be the skipper in test formats for Bangladesh. [67] In the home series against Zimbabwe in November, 2014 , Bangladesh whitewashed Zimbabwe in both the two tests and five ODIs. [68] He was also awarded the man of the series for the ODI matches.[ citation needed ]

Dif the game (originally from the Flemish 'krickstoel', a low stool on which parishioners knelt in church). There is also a reference to 'criquet' in North-East France in 1478 and evidence that the game evolved in South-East England in the Middle Ages .
In 1706 William Goldwyn published the first description of the game. He wrote that two teams were first seen carrying their curving bats to the venue, choosing a pitch and arguing over the rules to be played. They pitched two sets of wickets, each with a "milk-white" bail perched on two stumps; toss a coin for first knock, the umpire called "play" and the "leathern orb" was bowled. They had four-ball overs, the umpires leant on their staves (which the batters had to touch to complete a run), and the scorers sat on a mound making notches.
The first written " Laws of Cricket " were drawn up in 1744. They stated, "the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes. The stumps must be 22 inches high and the bail across them six inches. The ball must be between 5 & 6 ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22 yards apart". There were no limits on the shape or size of the bat. It appears that 40 notches was viewed as a very big score, probably due to the bowlers bowling quickly at shins unprotected by pads. The world's first cricket club was formed in Hambledon in the 1760s and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was founded in 1787.
During the 1760s and 1770s it became common to pitch the ball through the air, rather than roll it along the ground. This innovation gave bowlers the weapons of length, deception through the air, plus increased pace. It also opened new possibilities for spin and swerve. In response, batters had to master timing and shot selection. One immediate consequence was the replacement of the curving bat with the straight one. All of this raised the premium on skill and lessened the influence of rough ground and brute force. It was in the 1770s that the modern game began to take shape. The weight of the ball was limited to between five and a half and five and three-quarter ounces, and the width of the bat to four inches. The latter ruling followed an innings by a batter called Thomas "Daddy" White , who appeared with a bat the width of the wicket. In 1774, the first leg before law was published. Also around this time, a third stump became commonplace. By 1780, three days had become the duration of a major match, and this year also saw the creation of the first six-seam cricket ball. In 1788, the MCC published its first revision of the laws, which prohibited charging down an opponent and also provided for mowing and covering the wicket in order to standardise conditions. The desire for standardisation reflected the massive increase in the popularity of cricket during the 18th century. Between 1730 and 1740, 150 cricket matches were recorded in the papers of the time. Between 1750 and 1760, this figure rose to 230, and between 1770 and 1790 over 500.
The 19th century saw a series of significant changes. Wide deliveries were outlawed in 1811. The circumference of the ball was specified for the first time in 1838 (its weight had been dictated 60 years earlier). Pads, made of cork, became available for the first time in 1841, and these were further developed following the invention of vulcanised rubber, which was also used to introduce protective gloves in 1848. In the 1870s, boundaries were introduced – previously, all hits had to be run; if the ball went into the crowd, the spectators would clear a way for the fieldsman to fetch it. The biggest change, however, was in how the ball was delivered by the bowler.
At the start of the century, all bowlers were still delivering the ball under-arm. However, so the story goes, John Willes became the first bowler to use a "round-arm" technique after practising with his sister Christina, who had used the technique, as she was unable to bowl underarm due to her wide dress impeding her delivery of the ball. [5]
The round-arm action came to be employed widely in matches but was quickly determined to be illegal and banned by the MCC, who stated that "the ball must be delivered underhand, not thrown or jerked, with the hand underneath the elbow at the time of delivering the ball". [6] When it was accepted the rules stated that the arm could not be raised above the shoulder. It was quickly found, however, that a raised arm imparted more accuracy and generated more bounce than the roundarm method. Again, the governing body banned the method. It was not until the method was finally accepted by the MCC in 1835 [7] that it grew rapidly in popularity amongst all players. Underarm bowling hitherto had almost disappeared from the game.
Modern-day underarm bowling[ edit ]
An infamous " underarm bowling incident " occurred during a match in 1981, in which the Australian bowler, Trevor Chappell, took advantage of the fact that underarm bowling was still legal by rolling the ball along the ground. By doing so he avoided the possibility that the New Zealand batsman, Brian McKechnie, would score a six from the last ball to tie the match, as the bat would not be able to hit the ball high enough to score a six. [8]
As a result of this incident underarm bowling was subsequently made illegal in all grades of cricket, except by prior agreement of both teams, as it was not considered to be within the spirit of the game
The bowling action[ edit ]
The typical bowling action of a fast bowler.
Bowling the ball is distinguished from simply throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition.
Originally, this definition said that the elbow joint must not straighten out during the bowling action. Bowlers generally hold their elbows fully extended and rotate the arm vertically about the shoulder joint to impart velocity to the ball, releasing it near the top of the arc. Flexion at the elbow is not allowed, but any extension of the elbow was deemed to be a throw and would be liable to be called a no ball. This was thought to be possible only if the bowler's elbow was originally held in a slightly flexed position.
In 2005, this definition was deemed to be physically impossible by a scientific investigative commission. Biomechanical studies that showed that almost all bowlers extend their elbows somewhat throughout the bowling action, because the stress of swinging the arm around hyperextends the elbow joint. A guideline was introduced to allow extensions or hyperextensions of angles up to 15 degrees before deeming the ball illegally thrown.
Bowling actions are typically divided into side on and front on actions. In the side on action, the back foot lands parallel to the bowling crease and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking over his front shoulder. In the front on action, the back foot lands pointing down the pitch and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking inside the line of his front arm. Many bowlers operate with a mid-way action with the back foot landing at roughly 45 degrees and the upper body aligned somewhere between side on and front on. This is not to be confused with a mixed action, which mixes distinct elements of both side on and front on actions, and is generally discouraged amongst young bowlers as it can lead to problems in later life due to the twisting of the back inherent in the action.

Goals of bowling[ edit ]
In a game of cricket, the ultimate priority of the fielding side is to restrict the total number of runs scored by the batting side, and the actions of the bowlers will be fundamental to achieving this objective. The primary means of achieving this is by dismissing the batting side by getting all ten of the opposition wickets as quickly as possible. A secondary objective will be to keep the batting side's run rate as low as possible. In fact, in most forms of cricket, the twin aims of the fielding side are targeted concurrently, as the achievement of one aim tends to have a positive effect upon the other. Taking regular opposition wickets will remove the better batsmen from the crease, typically leading to a slowing of the scoe paaltjiewagter is 'n spesialisveldwerker van die boul-/veldwerkspan wat direk agter die paaltjies plek inneem, en is die enigste speler wat verantwoordelik is om ál die balle wat geboul word af te keer (of te vang) indien die kolwer nie 'n vorentoe hou met die kolf kon/wou uitvoer nie.
Dit kom verder daarop neer dat die paaltjiewagter in 'n posisie is om die meeste vangskote van enige veldwerker waar te neem, aangesien hy direk in die vlug van die bal staan (of hurk) wanneer dit deurskiet van, of moontlik skrams gereflekteer word (Engels: "nicked") deur die kolwer voor die paaltjies.
Die paaltjiewagter moet ook sorg dat die teenstander-kolwer altyd binne sy kolfkampie bly, deur te dreig om 'n stonkpoging uit te voer wanneer die kolwer "ronddwaal" buite die kampie, nadat hy die bouler se aflewering agter gevang het.
'n Verdere belangrike taak van 'n paaltjiewagter is om, wanneer 'n dryfhou deur die kolwer uitgevoer is, direk by die paaltjies aan sy kant stelling in te neem. Hy doen dit in opwagting van die bal wat deur 'n medespanlid (veldwerker) teruggegooi sal word na die paaltjies toe van bv. die dekveld of die grens af. Indien hy die bal vroeg terug ontvang, kan hy die kolwer uithardloop deur sy paaltjies om te gooi. Aangesien hy die enigste veldwerker is wat handskoene mag dra, is dit dit veiligste opsie om die bal na hóm in te gooi, eerder as na die bouler (aan die ander kant), wie se hande beseer kan word deur 'n harde ingooi.
Die paaltjiewagter is ook die enigste veldwerker wat beenskutte dra, alhoewel hulle deesdae korter en ligter is as kolfbeenskutte.
Uit bostaande kan afgelei word dat die paaltjiewagter 'n spesialisposisie op die veld is.

== Purposes ==  The keeper's major function is to stop deliveries that pass the batsman (in order to prevent [[run (cricket)|runs]] being scored as 'byes'), but he can also attempt to [[dismissal (cricket)|dismiss]] the batsman in various ways: * The most common dismissal effected by the keeper is for him to ''[[catch (cricket)|catch]]'' a ball that has nicked the batsman's bat, called an ''edge'', before it bounces. Sometimes the keeper is also in the best position to catch a ball which has been hit high in the air. More catches are taken by wicket-keepers than by any other fielding position. * The keeper can ''[[Stumping|stump]]'' the batsman by using the ball to remove the [[bail (cricket)|bails]] from the [[stump (cricket)|stumps]], if the batsman has come out of his [[crease (cricket)|crease]] during a delivery. * When the ball is hit into the outfield, the keeper moves close to the stumps to catch the return throw from a fielder and, if possible, to ''[[run out]]'' a batsman.  A keeper's position depends on the [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]]: for [[fast bowling]] he will crouch some distance from the stumps, in order to have time to react to edges from the batsman, while for slower bowling, he will come much nearer to the stumps (known as "standing up"), to pressure the batsman into remaining within the crease or risk being stumped. The more skilled the keeper, the faster the bowling to which he is able to "stand up", for instance [[Godfrey Evans]] often stood up to [[Alec Bedser]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/12543.html|title=Godfrey Evans|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>  Wicket-keeping is a specialist discipline and it requires training consistent with the level expected of a specialist batsman or [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]]. However, the modern-day keeper is also expected to possess reasonable batting skill, suiting him for the middle order at least. Wicket-keepers who are also capable of batting at the top of the order are known informally as ''keeper/batsmen''.  Since there is only room for one keeper in a cricket side, selectors (especially at the international level) are often faced with a difficult choice between two or more skilled keepers. Often, one of the two keepers is an exceptional keeper, but only an average batsman, whereas the other is a keeper/batsman who is clearly better at batting, but not quite as good a keeper as his rival. One such selection dilemma was that faced by [[English cricket team|England]] selectors in the 1990s between [[Jack Russell (Gloucestershire cricketer)|Jack Russell]] (the pure keeper) and [[Alec Stewart]] (the keeper/batsman). They were never able to consistently choose between the two until 1998, when Russell began to fade: prior to that, they had regularly swapped the role, often with Stewart maintaining his place when not wicket-keeping thanks to his batting skill.  The keeper may also have a [[Captain (cricket)|captaincy]] role. Uniquely, they are usually involved in every delivery of an innings, and may be in a position to see things that the captain misses. They can frequently be heard encouraging the bowler, and may also indulge in the practice (not meant to be overheard) of "[[sledging (cricket)|sledging]]" the batsman with well timed comments about their skill, appearance or personal habits.  The keeper is the only fielder allowed to touch the ball with protective equipment, typically large padded gloves with webbing between the index finger and thumb, but no other webbing. The protection offered by the gloves is not always adequate. The England keeper [[Alan Knott]] sometimes placed [[steak]]s inside his gloves for added cushioning. Wicket-keepers also tend to wear leg pads and a box to protect the groin area.  Wicket-keepers are allowed to take off their pads and bowl, though this rarely happens but is not uncommon when matches are drifting to draws or a bowling team is desperate for a wicket. Two keepers have removed their pads and taken [[hat-trick (cricket)|hat-tricks]] in first-class cricket: Probir Sen for Bengal v Orissa at Cuttack in 1954–55 and [[Alan Smith (cricketer)|A.C. (Alan) Smith]] for Warwickshire v Essex at Clacton in 1965; Smith was a most unusual player in that he was primarily a wicket-keeper, but was sometimes selected as a frontline bowler.

Early domestic career[ edit ]
Manjrekar made his first-class cricket debut on 7 March 1985, scoring 57 runs in his only innings for Bombay during their Ranji Trophy quarter-final victory over Haryana . [7] He retained his place for the semi-final, but did not play again after that until the following season. [8] He performed steadily in 1985–86, averaging 42.40 with the bat, though his highest score was 51 not out . [9] The following season, he struck his first century in first-class cricket, remaining 100 not out during the first innings of a match against Baroda . [10] He scored one other hundred that season, and his season's average was 76.40. [9] He struck a double century for West Zone in October 1987, scoring 278 runs from 376 before being run out . [11]
International career[ edit ]
In late 1987, Manjrekar made his international debut, facing the West Indies in Delhi. He scored five runs in the first innings, and ten in the second, when he retired hurt. [12] His first half-century in international cricket was made against New Zealand in December 1988, during a One Day International . Manjrekar scored 52 runs during a narrow victory for India. [13] The following April, he scored his maiden Test cricket century, hitting 108 against the West Indies. [14] He scored his second Test century in November 1989, against Pakistan. In the fourth innings of the match, he scored 113 not out to help India draw the match. [15] In the third Test of the same series, Manjrekar made his highest score in Test cricket, reaching 218 runs in the first innings, before being run out. [16] He did not score another international century for two years, when he hit 105 runs from 82 balls in an ODI against South Africa . [17]
Domestically, he enjoyed success in the 1990–91 season, scoring four centuries and one half-century in eight first-class appearances. During the season, he scored his highest total, 377, [9] in the Ranji Trophy semi-final against Hyderabad . [18] He played in the final of the 1994–95 Ranji Trophy, scoring 224 runs to help Bombay to a total of 690/6 declared in their first innings, a total that saw them win the trophy. [19]
Manjrekar scored his final international century against Zimbabwe , in October 1992, reaching 104 in a drawn Test match. [20] He continued to play for India until November 1996, making his final appearance in the first Test against South Africa. He scored 34 runs in the first innings and 5 runs in the second, playing as an opening batsman. [8] [21] He completed his international career with 2,043 Test runs, including four centuries, scored at 38.67, and 1,994 ODI runs at an average of 33.23. [1] He won a second Ranji Trophy final in 1996–97, captaining his team, by this stage renamed Mumbai. Manjrekar scored 78 runs in the match, in which both sides only batted one innings. [22] Manjrekar kept playing domestic cricket until the end of the 1997–98 season, and had a batting average of 55.11 in first-class cricket, and 45.79 for List A cricket .
Post Retirement[ edit ]
After retiring from professional cricket, Manjrekar works as a cricket commentator. [1] [23] He is considered to be a wonderful singer by some of his former team-mates. He released an Indipop album called 'Rest Day'. He sang some of his favorite songs as well as some Indian cricketers' favorites. [24]

Travel modes[ edit ]
Road and rail
Private vehicles are the main form of transportation within Auckland, with around 7% of journeys in the Auckland region being undertaken by bus (2006 data), [79] and 2% undertaken by train and ferry. [79] For trips to the city centre at peak times the use of public transport is much higher, with more than half of trips are undertaken by bus, train or ferry. [80] Auckland still ranks quite low in its use of public transport, having only 46 public transport trips per capita per year, [80] [81] while Wellington has almost twice this number at 91, and Sydney has 114 trips. [82] This strong roading focus results in substantial traffic congestion during peak times. [83]
Bus services in Auckland are mostly radial, with few cross-town routes. Late-night services (i.e. past midnight) are limited, even on weekends. A major overhaul of Auckland's bus services is planned to be implemented by 2016, significantly expanding the reach of "frequent" bus services: those that operate at least every 15 minutes during the day and early evening, every day of the week. [84]
Rail services operate along four lines travel between the CBD and the west, south and south-east of Auckland, with longer-distance trains operating to Wellington only a few times each week. [85] Following the opening of Britomart Transport Centre in 2003, major investment in Auckland's rail network occurred, involving station upgrades, rolling stock refurbishment and infrastructure improvements. [86] [87] The rail upgrade has included electrification of Auckland's rail network , with electric trains constructed by Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles commencing service in April 2014. [88] A number of proposed projects to further extend Auckland's rail network were included in the 2012 Auckland Plan , including the City Rail Link , rail to Auckland Airport , the Avondale-Southdown Line and rail to the North Shore .
Other modes
Auckland's ports are the second largest of the country, behind the Port of Tauranga , [89] and a large part of both inbound and outbound New Zealand commerce travels through them, mostly via the facilities northeast of Auckland CBD. Freight usually arrives at or is distributed from the port via road, though the port facilities also have rail access. Auckland is a major cruise ship stopover point, with the ships usually tying up at Princes Wharf . Auckland CBD is connected to coastal suburbs, to the North Shore and to outlying islands by ferry.
The International Terminal at Auckland International Airport
Air
Auckland has various small regional airports and Auckland Airport , the busiest of the country. Auckland Airport, New Zealand's largest, is in the southern suburb of Mangere on the shores of the Manukau Harbour. There are frequent services to Australia, and to other New Zealand destinations. There are also direct connections to many locations in the South Pacific, to the United States, Asia and to Santiago in South America. [90]
Policies
Research at Griffith University has indicated that in the last 50 years, Auckland has engaged in some of the most pro-automobile transport policies anywhere in the world. [91] With public transport declining heavily during the second half of the 20th century (a trend mirrored in most Western countries such as the US), [92] and increased spending on roads and cars, New Zealand (and specifically Auckland) now has the second-highest vehicle ownership rate in the world, with around 578 vehicles per 1000 people. [93] Auckland has also been called a very pedestrian- and cyclist-unfriendly city, though some efforts are being made to change this. [94] At the same, high-profile gaps in the network, such as the inability for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the Waitemata Harbour, will probably remain for the foreseeable future, with councils generally not considering the costs involved as sensible expense. [95]

Infrastructure[ edit ]
The State Highway network connects the different parts of Auckland, with State Highway 1 being the major north-south thoroughfare through the city (including both the Northern and Southern Motorways ) and the main connection to the adjoining regions of Northland and Waikato . The Northern Busway runs alongside parts of the Northern Motorway on the North Shore. Other state highways within Auckland include State Highway 16 (the Northwest Motorway), State Highway 18 (the Upper Harbour Motorway) and State Highway 20 (the Southwest Motorway). State Highway 22 is a non-motorway rural arterial connecting Pukekohe to the Southern Motorway at Drury .
The Auckland Harbour Bridge , opened in 1959, is the main connection between the North Shore aring rate. Conversely, slowing the scoring rate can put additional pressure on the batsmen and force them into taking extra risks, which will often lead to wickets.
Depending upon the format of the match, these two strategies will be given different weights. In an unlimited, timed or declaration match, the main aim of the bowling attack will be to take wickets, so attacking bowling and fielding strategies will be used. In a limited overs match, this aim will also be supplemented by the secondary need to prevent the batting side from scoring quickly, so more defensive strategies will be used. In general, the shorter the number of overs per side, the more priority will be given to this secondary target of maintaining a low run-rate. It is also highly probable that the need for attacking or defensive strategies can switch frequently as a cricket match progresses. It is the sign of a good cricket captain to be able to tell which strategy is most appropriate in any set of circumstances and the best way of implementing it.
Bowling tactics[ edit ]
David Masters in midflight, illustrating the position of the body during a delivery at the end of a run up, prior to bowling the ball.
The simultaneous twin objectives of bowling are to take wickets and prevent run scoring opportunities. Both objectives are achieved through the underlying aim of bowling the ball in such a way that the batsman is unable to connect with the ball in the middle of the bat and control its movement after contact. There are three distinct means of achieving this aim: by bowling the ball on a good line and length, by bowling with sufficient pace that the batsman struggles to react to the delivery, or by bowling the ball in such a way that it has lateral movement as it approaches the batsman, either in the air or off the ground. A good bowler may be able to combine two of these skills, a truly great bowler may be able to combine all three.
Line and length[ edit ]
The fundamental skill of bowling on a good length incorporates the ability to pitch the ball such a distance from the batsman that he is unable to move forward and drive the ball on the half volley, and is also unable to step back and play the ball on the back foot. This removes many of the batsman's attacking options, and also increases the probability of him misjudging a delivery and losing his wicket. A good length delivery is one in which the ball has had sufficient time to move far enough off the pitch to beat the bat but the batsman has not had time to react to the movement and adjust his shot. The faster the bowler and the greater the movement he is able to generate, the larger the area of the pitch that can be designated an effective "good" length.
Other areas of the pitch may also often be used as a variation to a good length delivery. Primarily these are the yorker , in which the ball is bowled directly at the batsman's feet as a surprise delivery intended to dismiss the batsman bowled , and the bouncer in which the ball is bowled on such a short length that it rises towards the batsman's throat or head as a means of physical intimidation. But the height of an attempted yorker or full toss must not be higher than the batsman's waist, or else in will be called a no ball beamer , which could have bowlers banned from the match.
The line a bowler chooses to bowl will depend on several factors: the movement he is generating on the ball, the shots the batsman is able to play, and the field the captain has set. The two most common tactics are to either bowl directly at the stumps, or to bowl 3 inches to 6 inches outside the line of off stump. Bowling at the stumps is an attacking tactic with the intention of dismissing the batsman bowled or lbw . It can also be used as a defensive tactic, as the batsman will feel less able to play risky shots knowing that he will be dismissed should he miss the ball. Bowling outside off stump is known as the corridor of uncertainty. When done well, this line may confuse the batsman into whether to defend the ball or leave it, and may tempt him to play away from his body with his head not in line with the ball. The main aim of this tactic is to dismiss the batman caught by the wicketkeeper or in the slips . Other bowling variations, such as bowling wide of off stump or bowling at leg stump are generally seen as negative and defensive tactics.
Some different types of bowling tactic:

The rules[ edit ]
A batsman is out Run out if at any time while the ball is in play nght the ball, he can also refer the decision.
A six is scored if the batsman hits the ball directly beyond the perimeter of the field. In some cases the ball may bounce just a foot inside the boundary rope resulting in four runs . If the umpire needs to ascertain if it had been a 4 or a 6, he may consult the third umpire. Near the boundary, often a fielder may dive to save the ball from travelling beyond the boundary. If the fielder makes any simultaneous contact with the boundary and the cricket ball, 4 runs are declared. A third umpire may also be consulted in such a case.
Instant Replays[ edit ]
Whenever a 3rd umpire decision is signalled by an on-field umpire. The 3rd umpire gets access to Instant Replay to make his decision. The instant replays are also available for the TV/Internet viewers. However, the live crowd does not get to witness it. Because in most of the cases, 3rd umpire decisions end up in a tight gap between out and not out. Live crowd will make their decision on the replay shown. However, the third umpire is required to follow guidelines which may After Stuart Broad incident, in The Ashes 2013, ICC has started to take steps to give third umpire access to instant replays. This is regardless of being referred to by on-field umpires. By doing so, ICC wants to make sure any obvious mistakes are avoided in future. [4]

Usage
{{ Football squad }} is designed to be used within squad list templates (typically placed at the bottom of a player page) in order to make editing and standardisation easier. If you want to use this template first set up a new template for your squad, typically called something like Template:(team name) squad.
Templates useful for formatting the list are:
{{ football squad2 player }} - takes parameters "no" (number) and "name" (player name).
{{football squad manager}} - takes the parameter "name" (manager name) and the optional parameter "title" (defaults to Manager, other commonly assigned values are Coach and Head Coach). Has no bullet mark afterward, use only as the last entry on a list.
Options
teamdisplay: Use this parameter when you want the name displayed on the top line of the box to be different than the full title of the article about the team; for example, where the article title is qualified to disambiguate between two similarly-named teams. See {{ Olimpija Ljubljana squad }} for an example of usage.
{{football squad | name = {{subst:PAGENAME}} | teamname = Norwich City F.C. | bgcolor = yellow | textcolor = green | bordercolor = green | list =  {{football squad2 player|no=1|name=[[Robert Green|Green]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=2|name=[[Matthieu Louis-Jean|Louis-Jean]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=3|name=[[Adam Drury (footballer, born 1978)|Drury]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=4|name=[[Jason Shackell|Shackell]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=5|name=[[Craig Fleming|Fleming]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=6|name=[[Darren Huckerby|Huckerby]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=8|name=[[Peter Thorne (footballer)|Thorne]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=10|name=[[Robert Earnshaw|Earnshaw]]}} {{football squad manager|name=[[Glenn Roeder|Roeder]]}} }}

Partial transclusion
By using <noinclude>, <onlyinclude> and <includeonly> markup, it is possible to transclude part of a page, rather than all of it. Such partial transclusions can be achieved by transcluding from any pages, including subpages. It is often useful to exclude part of a page in a transclusion, an example being with template documentation.
For an example of how this technique can be applied to simplify the creation of summary articles , see how part of the History of pathology (see the diff here ) was transcluded into Pathology (see the diff here ) using the
{{:History of pathology}}
markup. The Pathology article at that time (see here ) mainly consisted of transcluded lead paragraphs and other sections from a number of articles. Look at the source to see how this was done. Since then, the Pathology article has been rewritten, and does not include all these transclusions.
Another example can be found in the transclusion of part of HitRecord (introductory paragraph only) into a same-named summary section in Joseph Gordon-Levitt .
Markup
See also: Help:Template § Noinclude, includeonly, and onlyinclude and Help:Category § Categories and templates
In transclusion, a source page is transcluded into a destination page. But with partial transclusion, only part of that source page will be transcluded into a destination page. But in addition, what is transcluded to a destination page does not have to be visible on the source page.
Page rendering of a source page can be defined as the rendering of that source page when it is saved, which will be the same as the preview . We can call this rendering here.
Transclusion rendering of a source page can be defined as the rendering of a destination page that has a source page transcluded into it; but only that part of the destination page that was transcluded from the source page. The preview of the transclusion rendering will again be identical. We can call this rendering there.
There are three pairs of tags involved in cases where page rendering here should differ from transclusion rendering there. As described earlier, these are <noinclude>, <includeonly> and <onlyinclude>. These tags are invisible, but affect both page rendering here and transclusion rendering there. These tags pair-off to demarcate sections that will create differences. Each tag will describe exceptions to transcluding the whole page named.
<noinclude> This section is visible here; but this section is not visible there. Sections outside of these tags will be visible both here and there. </noinclude> <onlyinclude> This section is visible here; this section is also visible there. Sections outside of these tags will be visible here, but will not be visible there. </onlyinclude> <includeonly> This section is not visible here; but it is visible there. Sections outside of these tags will be visible both here and there. </includeonly>

In short
Creating a user account means that you supply a username (your real name or a nickname) and a password . The system will reject a username that is already in use. A user account is created only once. You are then "logged in". Next time you log in you nd the rest of the Auckland metropolitan area. The Harbour Bridge provide eight lanes of vehicle traffic with a moveable median barrier, but does not provide access for rail, pedestrians or cyclists. The Central Motorway Junction , also called 'Spaghetti Junction' for its complexity, is the intersection between the two major motorways of Auckland (State Highway 1 and State Highway 16).
Two of the longest arterial roads within Greater Auckland are Great North Road and Great South Road – the main connections in those directions before the construction of the State Highway network. Numerous arterial roads also provide regional and sub-regional connectivity, with many of these roads (especially on the isthmus) previously used to operate Auckland's former tram network along.
Auckland has three main railway lines ( Western , Eastern and Southern ) with branch lines to Manukau and Onehunga . These railway lines serve the general western, southern and central eastern parts of Auckland from the Britomart Transport Centre in downtown Auckland, the terminal station for all lines, where connections are also available to ferry and bus services. There are plans to connect Britomart with the Western Line near Mt Eden, via an underground rail tunnel known as the City Rail Link project.
Electricity[ edit ]
Auckland is New Zealand's largest electricity consumer, and uses around 20% of the country's total electricity each year. Vector, which operates the majority of Auckland's local distribution system, measured maximum demand to be 1722 MW in 2011, with 8679 GWh delivered. [96]
There are two major electricity generation stations located within the city, both of which are natural gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine stations. Otahuhu B is owned by Contact Energy and generates 380 MW, while Southdown is owned by Mighty River Power and generates 175 MW. Since there is not enough generation in Auckland to meet the demand, and there is very little generation north of Auckland, most of the electricity for Auckland and Northland must be transmitted from power stations in the south, mainly from Huntly Power Station and the Waikato River hydroelectric stations.
Transpower owns the national grid and is responsible for the high voltage transmission lines into and across Auckland. Five major 220 kV transmission lines connect Auckland with the Waikato, terminating into Otahuhu and Brownhill substations. The sub-transmission and distribution network in the Auckland region is mostly owned by Vector . The network south of central Papakura is owned by Counties Power.
There have been several notable power outages in Auckland. The five-week-long 1998 Auckland power crisis blacked out much of the CBD after a cascade failure occurred on four underground cables in Mercury Energy's sub-transmission network. The 2006 Auckland Blackout interrupted supply to the CBD and many inner suburbs after an earth wire shackle at Transpower's Otahuhu substation broke and short-circuited the lines supplying the inner city. In 2009, much of the northern and western suburbs, as well as all of Northland , experienced a blackout when a forklift accidentally came into contact with the Otahuhu to Henderson 220 kV line, the only major line supplying the region. [97] Transpower spent $1.25 billion in the early 2010s reinforcing the supply into and across Auckland, including a 400 kV-capable transmission line from the Waikato River to Brownhill substation (operated at 220 kV initially), and 220 kV underground cables between Brownhill and Pakuranga, and between Pakuranga and Albany via the CBD . These reduced the Auckland Region's reliance on Otahuhu substation and northern and western Auckland's reliance on the Otahuhu to Henderson line.

Projection of the Auckland Region's population growth to 2031.
Auckland is expecting substantial population growth via immigration and natural population increases (which contribute to growth at about one-third and two-thirds, respectively), [98] and is set to grow to an estimated 1.9 million inhabitants by 2031. [66] [99] This substantial increase in population will have a major impact on transport, housing and other infrastructure that is in many cases already considered under pressure. It is also feared by some organisations, such as the Auckland Regional Council , that urban sprawl will result from the growth and, as a result, that it is necessary to address this proactively in planning policy.
A 'Regional Growth Strategy' has been adopted that sees limits on further subdivision and intensification of existing use as its main sustainability measures. [100] This policy is contentious, as it naturally limits the uses of private land, especially the subdivision of urban fringe properties, [101] by setting 'Metropolitan Urban Limits' in planning documents like the District Plan . [102]
According to the 2006 Census projections, the medium-variant scenario shows that the population is projected to continue growing, to reach 1.93 million by 2031. The high-variant scenario shows the region's population growing to over two million by 2031. [103]

Line and length in cricket refers to the direction and point of bouncing on the pitch of a delivery . The two concepts are frequently discussed together.
Line[ edit ]
The line of a delivery is the direction of its trajectory measured in the horizontal plane . More simply, it is a measure of how far to the left or right the ball is travelling, compared to a line drawn straight down the pitch. It is usually referred to in terms of the directions off (away in front of the batsman ) and leg (in towards or behind the batsman), rather than left and right, however.
Line controls how much room the batsman has to play various shots, and sometimes dictates what shot he must play. A line directed at the wicket , for example, must be defended with the bat, as failing to hit the ball will result in the batsman being out bowled , whilst a batsman blocking the ball with the body is likely to be out leg before wicket .
Despite this most direct method of getting the batsman out, bowlers often concentrate their line outside off stump , where the batsman does not necessarily have to hit the ball to avoid being out. A line just outside off stump is sometimes referred to as the corridor of uncertainty , as the batsman may be in two minds whether or not he needs to hit the ball to prevent it hitting his wicket. In this state, the batsman has little choice but to attempt to hit the ball, as not doing so could be disastrous. By thus forcing the batsman to play at the ball with some element of uncertainty, the bowler's goal is to induce a poorly executed shot that may offer a catch to a fielder, or ricochet the ball into the wicket.
Line can also be used strategically to restrict run scoring. One method is to stack the fielders predominantly on either the leg or off side of the field, and then bowl consistently with a matching line, to make it difficult for the batsman to hit the ball to the opposite side of the field.
A deliberate policy of aiming the line of the ball at the batsman's body was employed by England during their 1932-1933 tour of Australia . This dangerous tactic has since been outlawed. See Bodyline for full details.
Length[ edit ]

Fourth umpire sometimes referred to as the reserve umpire , is a cricket official. For all international matches a fourth umpire is required to perform duties like bringing on the new ball, carrying drinks on to the field for the umpires, checking the batteries in the light meter and observing the pitch during the lunch and tea intervals to make sure there is no interference. The Fourth umpire will take over the Third umpire duties if something happens to one of the onfield umpires, as the rules state the third umpire will take over on field duties.

Question[ edit ]
Why isn't the amount of runs cxvbcvbcvb each wicket keeper displayed as these days wicket keepers are selected on the grounds of keeping and batting
Why was a hyphen inserted into Wicketkeeper? Goalkeeper indicates wiki style to not use the hyphen. Moved a page a few days ago and got bollocked because the edit history was reputedly lost.. Now this page has been edited again, how do I move it back to the Wicketkeeper page? Moriori 01:21, Mar 28, 2004 (UTC)
The hyphen is correct - take a look at the Lord's page http://www.lords.org/cricket/lw_0000000066.asp Bob Palin 03:05, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)
yup: "wicket-keeper": Law 40: http://www.lords.org/data/files/laws_of_cricket_2003-8685.pdf
I'll go and make that term uniform article wide. 60.226.133.172 11:59, 28 April 2007 (UTC)
Correction required - P Sen was not the designated wicketkeeper in the game where he took a hat-trick - G Chakraboty was - although Sen was the more usual Bengali keeper (source CricketArchive scorecards)

Attention needed[ edit ]
Considering that this is a high importance topic under the WP:CRIC banner, the article is in a very poor state and is particularly afflicted by "recentism". Have flagged it for attention in the assessment template above. --- BlackJack | talk page 08:01, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
Question: When an over is completed, and the bowler changes, and the bowling is effected from the other end of the pitch, the same wicket-keeper re-positions himself at the other side of the pitch?

Help & Tips ↓
Don't resolve redirects — Normally, the tool will try to resolve redirects, so if you use "WP:ANI" for the page name, it will resolve it to "Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents".  However, in the rare case that you want to list a user's contributions to a page that is currently a redirect, check this checkbox.
Allow wildcards in page title — To search through a range of pages, use asterisks in the page name for wildcards.  Note that wildcards do not work in the namespace, so "User*:Snottywong" won't return edits from "User:Snottywong" and "User talk:Snottywong".  Use wildcards only after the colon.
Page title is case sensitive — When wildcards are enabled, the pages search is not case sensitive unless this checkbox is checked.  This option has no effect when wildcards are not enabled.

This is so that we don't have to call the options table e ball bounces. It is described as being either short (bouncing closer to the bowler), long or full (bouncing nearer the batsman), or a good length (an optimal length, somewhere in between).
The length of a ball controls how high the ball rises from the pitch as it reaches the batsman's stance position. A ball pitched too short rises relatively high and loses some of its pace, making it easier to hit. A ball pitched too long does not have time to deviate horizontally in its flight, also making it easier for the batsman to hit. A good length ball is a compromise between these two, bouncing far enough from the batsman for lateral deviation to be significant, but not so far that he can react easily to hit it. For quick bowlers the "good length ball" (often referred to as a "salmon length ball" in Australia) is usually six to eight metres in front of the batsman, and for slower bowlers (spin) it is usually at about three to four metres before the batsman, though the optimal length will vary according to the state of the pitch, prevailing climatic conditions and the height and playing style of the batsman.
A bowler can use variation in length to upset the rhythm of a batsman. A typical sequence would be a series of slightly short balls to force the batsman into playing shots with his weight on the back foot, to allow him more time to hit the ball, followed by a full ball bouncing near the batsman's legs. If the batsman does not react to the change in length quickly enough, he can be left with his weight on the back foot and, if he misses the ball with his bat, in danger of being out either bowled or leg before wicket .
Another attacking ploy is to pitch a ball very short, making it bounce up around head height as it passes the batsman. Such a bouncer requires the batsman to avoid being hit, and may intimidate him into uncertainty about the next few balls.

Early years and personal life[ edit ]
Ashwin was born in a Brahmin family. [3] He lives in West Mambalam, Chennai. [3] He did his schooling from Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan and St. Bede's . He attended SSN College of Engineering and graduated with a B.Tech in Information Technology.
On 13 November 2011, Ashwin married his childhood friend Prithi Narayanan. [4] Ashwin’s father Ravichandran played competitive cricket in Tamil Nadu. [5]
Career[ edit ]
2000–2010: Early career[ edit ]
Ashwin plays as an all-rounder for Tamil Nadu cricket team and South Zone. He plays for Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League . He was the highest wicket taker of the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 tournament for Chennai Super Kings in the tournament with 13 wickets and was adjudged as the player of the tournament.
2010–present: International career[ edit ]
In the back of his impressive performance in the 2010 Indian Premier League , Ashwin was selected in a second-string squad that toured Zimbabwe in May–June 2010. He made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka on 5 June 2010, scoring a 32–ball 38 and taking 2/50 in that match which India lost to crash out of the tri-series . [6] His T20I debut came a week later, against Zimbabwe at Harare where he took 1/22 in four overs in an Indian win. Ashwin was selected for the tri-series against New Zealand and hosts Sri Lanka, but did not get a game with Pragyan Ojha and Ravindra Jadeja being preferred over him throughout the series. [7] In October, the selectors decided to rest first-choice players in the three-match home ODI series against Australia, enabling Ashwin to get selected in the team again. Ashwin was the most economical bowler in the only match played in the series in which he took 1/34 in nine overs, while India registered a five-wicket victory. [8]
Ashwin played in all five matches of the home series against New Zealand in November–December 2010. India completed a 5–0 whitewash and Ashwin ended up as the leading wicket-taker of the series with 11 wickets at an average of 21.90. [9] At the conclusion of the series, Ashwin earned the praise of captain Gautam Gambhir , who called him "the find" of the series and hailed his bowling during the powerplay overs. [10] Despite this success, Ashwin failed to make it to the playing eleven in any of the five ODIs on the South African tour , with the inclusion of lead spinner Harbhajan Singh in the team. [11] However, Ashwin did manage to find a place in the 15-member World Cup squad that was announced during the series, with Harbhajan and Piyush Chawla being the other two specialist spinners in the squad. [12] He played only two matches in the World Cup and made his World Cup debut in March 2011 against the West Indies with bowling figures of 2/41 in 10 overs. He bowled his full quota in the quarterfinal against Australia at Ahmedabad and picked 2/52. India went on to win the tournament, but Ashwin did not feature in either the semifinal or the final.
Ashwin replaced vice-captain Harbhajan for the fourth and fifth ODIs of India's tour of West Indies in June–July 2011, but picked just one wicket. Ashwin was retained in the limited-overs squad for the England tour . He emerged as India's best bowler of the series, which India lost 3–0, taking six wickets at an average of 25.16. [13] England toured India in October 2011 and were whitewashed in the ODI series 5–0. With 10 scalps at 20.20, Ashwin was as the second-highest wicket-taker of the series, only behind teammate Jadeja. [14]
In November 2011, West Indies toured India for three Tests and five ODIs. Ashwin's recent ODI success saw him being included in the Test squad for the first time. Ashwin and Ojha were the only two specialist spinners in the squad, with Harbhajan being omitted owing to his indifferent form during the England tour. [15] Ashwin made his Test debut in the first match at Delhi, earning his cap from Sachin Tendulkar . Ashwin took 3/81 in the first innings and 6/47 in the second, helping India win the match. He was awarded the man of the match and became the third Indian player to win the award on Test debut. [16] [17] He picked four wickets in the second Test at Kolkata where India registered an innings victory. [18] In the third Test at Mumbai, he took 5/156 while West Indies made a total of 590 and scored his maiden international century in India's first innings (103 runs from 118 balls) to take India's total to 482. Ashwin thus became the third Indian to score a century and take a five-wicket haul in the same Test and the first since 1962. [19] West Indies were bowled out for 134 in their second innings as Ojha and Ashwin shared all ten wickets between them, with Ashwin picking 4/34. The match ended in a draw with scores level, after Ashwin took a single and was dismissed run out attempting a second run off the last ball of the match. He was awarded the man of the match as well as man of the series for his all-round performance. [20] Ashwin featured in four matches of the subsequent ODI series and took four wickets at 49.00. [21]
Ashwin was ineffective on India's 2011/12 tour of Australia . He played in three Tests on the tour taking nine wickets at an average of more than 62. [22] He also featured in the subsequent triangular CB series against Australia and Sri Lanka and took seven wickets in as many matches at 43.42. In March 2012, he took five wickets in three matches of the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh. He had a quiet tour of Sri Lanka in July–August 2012 taking five wickets at 39.40 in the five-match ODI series and 1/22 in the one-off T20I. [23]
Ashwin returned to form during the two-match home Test series against New Zealand. In the first Test at Hyderabad, he claimed 6/31 and 6/54 helping India seal an innings victory and was named man of the match. His match figures of 12/85 bettered S. Venkataraghavan 's 12/152 for the best figures by an Indian bowler against New Zealand in Tests. [24] [25] In the second match at Bangalore his efforts of 5/69 in the second innings helped India win the match and the series 2–0. [26] He was awarded man of the series for his tally of 18 wickets at 13.11 average. [27] Ashwin played four matches in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka and took five wickets at an erred to as the "attack". 94.5.67.102 ( talk ) 21:47, 11 February 2011 (UTC)



Domestic career[ edit ]
Ronchi is well known for his ability to score runs quickly and on 7 February 2007 he broke the record for the fastest domestic one-day hundred in Australian cricket. Opening the batting against New South Wales, Ronchi scored his maiden one-day ton off only 56 deliveries, beating the previous record held by fellow West Australian Adam Voges of 62 deliveries. When dismissed, he had scored 105 runs from just 64 balls and easily guided Western Australia to an 8-wicket victory over New South Wales .
Ronchi began the 2007–08 season in strong fashion. Proving that he is in the Australian selectors minds for the future, Ronchi was chosen as Australia A wicketkeeper for their tour of Pakistan . In the second first-class match of the tour, Ronchi scored a blistering 107 off 109 balls, striking 16 fours and 2 sixes. His good form continued into the Australian Domestic season, as he scored 104 against New South Wales in Western Australia's first List A match of the season.
In November 2007 Ronchi scored one of the fastest centuries in Australian Domestic history with a ton from 51 balls against Queensland . Ronchi struck 11 sixes in his innings of 105* with his second fifty coming from just 11 balls.
Ronchi was also recruited by the Mumbai Indians team in 2007, one of the eight Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises. He played five matches for the team, spread throughout the 2008 and 2009 tournaments , [2] scoring a total of 34 runs at an average of 6.80. [3]
Australia[ edit ]
In April 2008, Cricket Australia named Brad Haddin as the only wicketkeeper in its list of 25 contracted players, overlooking Ronchi. [4] Despite failing to receive a contract, Ronchi was called up to the Australian team in June 2008 during their tour of the West Indies when Haddin was unable to play after breaking his finger. After making his international debut in the tour's Twenty20 match (scoring 36 from 22 balls opening the batting with fellow West Australian on international debut, Shaun Marsh [5] ), he was not required to bat in his first two ODI matches.
In the final game of the series, he was elevated up the batting order to number three and batted very well to record the equal second fastest fifty by an Australian on his way to scoring 64 from 28 balls, including six sixes and was awarded the player of the match award (later in the same match David Hussey scored an even faster fifty relegating Ronchi's innings to equal third fastest). [6]
Ronchi made his debut on home soil in a Twenty20 match at the MCG against the South Africans as wicketkeeper when Haddin was rested from the team. [7]
New Zealand[ edit ]
In February 2012, Ronchi announced his intention to return to New Zealand in an attempt to qualify for the national team . [8] He signed with Wellington in March 2012, and made his Plunket Shield debut on 18 March against Central Districts , scoring a century, 111, on debut for the team. [9] [10]
In April 2013, Ronchi was selected by the New Zealand cricket board as part of the limited-overs squad for the New Zealand tour of England the following month. [11] He made his debut for the team on 31 May 2013 at Lord's , scoring a duck and taking three catches. [12] He thus became the first player to play international cricket for both Australia and New Zealand, 8th player in ODI history and the first since Kepler Wessels (Australia and South Africa) in the 1980s to play for two full members of the International Cricket Council . [13]
In January 2015, Ronchi hit an unbeaten 170 off 99 balls against Sri Lanka at University Oval in Dunedin . This was the highest by a batsman batting seventh or lower in ODIs, and also the third-highest score by a wicket-keeper, behind M. S. Dhoni 's 183 not out and Adam Gilchrist 's 172. [14]

Origin[ edit ]
The term first appeared in 1858 in cricket , to describe HH Stephenson 's taking three wickets with three consecutive deliveries . Fans held a collection for Stephenson, and presented him with a hat bought with the proceeds. [1] The term was used in print for the first time in 1878. [2] The term was eventually adopted by many other sports including hockey , association football , water polo and team handball .
See also: Lists of hat-tricks , List of FIFA World Cup hat-tricks and List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks
A hat-trick occurs in association football when a player scores three goals (though not necessarily consecutive) in a single game, whereas scoring two goals constitutes a brace. In common with other official record-keeping rules, goals in a penalty shootout are excluded from the tally. [3] The extra time in a knockout cup match may also be calculated towards a player's potential hat-trick. The fastest recorded time to score a hat-trick is 70 seconds, a record set by Alex Torr in a Sunday league game in 2013. [4] The previous Guinness world record of 90 seconds was held by Tommy Ross playing for Ross County against Nairn County on 28 November 1964. [5]
The first hat-trick in an international game was by Scottish player John McDougall , against England on March 2nd, 1878. [6] American player Bert Patenaude scored the first hat-trick in the FIFA World Cup , against Paraguay in the inaugural event . Two hat-tricks have been scored in a final , by Geoff Hurst for England in the 1966 final during extra time against West Germany , [7] and Carli Lloyd against Japan in the 2015 Women's World Cup final . Lloyd's was the fastest hat-trick scored in a World Cup final, but in the earlier qualifying stages, Fabienne Humm of Switzerland had achieved an even faster hat-trick, in the 47th, 49th and 52nd minutes against Ecuador . Football has also extended the term to include the phrase perfect hat-trick, achieved when a player scores one right-footed goal, one left-footed goal and one headeeconomy rate of 6 and average of 19. [28]
During the first Test of England's tour of India in late-2012, Ashwin became the fastest Indian to record 50 wickets in Test cricket as he overhauled the milestone in his ninth game. [29] India eventually lost the series 2–1 in which he struggled with the ball managing to take only 14 wickets across the four Tests at an average of 52.64. However, he scored 243 runs, averaging 60.75 per innings, including two fifties and finished as India's second best batsman of the series. [30] In the three-match ODI series against Pakistan and the five-match ODI series against England, he took three wickets at 43.33 and seven wickets at 35.71 respectively. [31] [32]
While playing for India Cements at the BCCI Corporate Trophy in February 2013, Ashwin worked with former Tamil Nadu spinner and childhood coach Sunil Subramaniam to make changes to his bowling ahead of the four-match Test series against Australia. Subramaniam and Ashwin spent a few hours every day for a week at the nets in Nagpur. Among the changes made was shortening Ashwin's bowling stride. [33]
There were a few changes I had to make after the England series [...] I had to work on my delivery stride, it had got a little long during the England series and that was affecting the way I was delivering the ball. We had very little time, but I was lucky to have a coach [Subramaniam] who identified it pretty quickly.

— Ashwin on the changes he made to his bowling before the Australia series. [33]
Ashwin was highly successful on Australia's four-Test tour of India in February–March 2013. In the first Test at Chennai, his home ground, he took 7/103 and 5/95 leading India to a comfortable eight-wicket victory. [34] He had a haul of 5/63 in the second innings of the second Test at Hyderabad where India registered an innings win. He took a total of four wickets in the Mohali Test where India sealed the series with a six-wicket victory. In the last match at Delhi, he took 5/57 and 2/55 in another Indian win which completed a 4–0 whitewash of Australia. During the match, Ashwin surpassed former India captain Anil Kumble 's tally of 27 wickets for most wickets by an Indian bowler in a four-Test series. [35] Ashwin finished the series as the leading wicket-taker with a tally of 29 wickets at 20.10 and won the Man of the Series award. [36] It was the first time India won four or more Tests in a series and the first time Australia were whitewashed since 1969–70. [37] Ashwin also became the third Indian off spinner to take 25-plus wickets in a series after E. A. S. Prasanna and Harbhajan Singh.
Ashwin was a member of the Indian team that won the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy in England. His figures of 2/15 in four overs in the 20-overs-a-side final helped India restrict England to 124/8 and win the match by five runs. [38] He had a total of eight wickets from five matches at an average of 22.62, conceding 4.41 runs per over, and ended as the joint-fifth highest wicket-taker of the tournament. [39] With nine wickets in six matches, Ashwin finished as the leading wicket-taker of the home ODI series against Australia in October–November 2013 which India won 3–2. [40]
On India's tour of South Africa , Ashwin had a difficult time with the ball. He picked only one wicket across three ODIs and went wicketless in his 42 overs in the first Test at Johannesburg, following which, he lost his spot in the team to Jadeja for the second Test. In early-2014, Ashwin's overseas struggles continued during the New Zealand tour where he managed to bag a solitary wicket in the five match ODI series which India lost 4–0. [41] However, in the third ODI, coming in to bat with India at 146/5 in pursuit of 315, he scored his maiden ODI fifty of 65 runs from 46 balls. He shared a 38-run partnership with Dhoni and an 85-run seventh wicket stand with Jadeja, as the match eventually ended in a tie. [42] In the two-match Test series that followed, Jadeja was preferred over Ashwin as the lone spinner in the playing eleven.
Ashwin was back among the wickets when India went to Bangladesh for the 2014 Asia Cup and the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 . He took nine wickets in four matches of the Asia Cup and finished as the joint-third highest wicket-taker of the tournament. [43] He played a vital role in India's unbeaten run to the World Twenty20 final. His tally of 11 wickets in six matches at an average of 11.27 and economy rate of 5.35 put him joint-third on the list of most wickets in the tournament. [44]
Ashwin was part of the Indian team that toured England in 2014 . He played his first match of the Test series only in the fourth game in which he scored 40 and 46 not out but went wicketless in an innings defeat for India. He took three wickets in the last match, which was another innings defeat. India and Ashwin found more success in the ODI series followed. With India winning the series 3–1, Ashwin took seven wickets from four matches at an average of 24.85 and economy rate of less than 4.5. [45] India whitewashed Sri Lanka in a five-match ODI series in November 2014 in which Ashwin had 6 wickets to his name at 33.33. [46]
Debutant leg-spinner Karn Sharma was chosen over Ashwin for the first Test of India's tour of Australia in December 2014. After Sharma's indifferent debut, Ashwin returned to the playing eleven as the lone spinner and took a total of 12 wickets at an average of 48.66 in the remaining three matches. [47]
I see a lot of myself in Ashwin. He is a fantastic cricketer with a lot of work ethic. Obviously, he is a far better batsman than me.

— Former India Test captain Anil Kumble on Ashwin, February 2015. [48]
Ashwin was selected to represent India for the second consecutive ODI World cup to be held in Australia-New Zealand in 2015.
In the 2015 three-match series against Sri Lanka , he dismissed Kumar Sangakkara , who was retiring following the second Test, four consecutive times in his final four innings. At the end of the series, he finished with 21 wickets and in the process broke the record for most wickets by an Indian bowler in a series against Sri Lanka. He was awarded the Man of the Series. [49]
In November 2015, Ashwin was a star performer through Freedom Trophy Test series against South Africa in India. On course of the series, he became the fastest Indian to reach 150 wickets in Test cricket. [50] In the third Test in Nagpur , he picked up 12 wickets for 98 runs to hand South Africa their first away series loss in nine years. His career-best figures of 7/66 in the second innings, bowled the visitors out for 185 and gave India a 2-0 series win.
Bowling style[ edit ]
Ashwin is a tall off-spinner who primarily relies on the bounce of the pitch to get his wickets. He produces a lot of variations of the ball and flights the ball thereby giving it more chance to spin and dip on the batsman. In addition to his normal off-breaks , he produces an arm ball and the carrom ball , the latter of which he uses frequently in the shorter formats. In IPL 2013 , he bowled leg-breaks and googly as well. [51] However, in an interview, he has stated that he refrains from bowling the doosra as it requires him to bend and straighten his arm which he finds difficult to do. [52]
Ashwin's childhood coach Sunil Subramaniam recalls Ashwin's early days at the TNCA Academy:
[...] what struck me was his intelligence. His use of angles, length and width of the crease. Also, guessing what a batsman was likely to do. And the kind of field placing that he is comfortable with. Those are the factors that struck me immediately – that this guy not only loves bowling, he also has a fair idea of what spin actually is. For somebody who started out at 18 or 19, I thought that was a big thing [...] Here is a guy who knew what the ball is supposed to do, where this guy is expected to play and what are the plans to keep that guy in check and put pressure on that guy. He was pretty clear at 18 itself. [53]

Virender Sehwag captained India after Rahul Dravid was ruled out for rest of the series following an injury. South Africa recovered from a bad start to reach 243 at the end of 50 overs. Gibbs remained unbeaten on 93 while Kallis and Pollock chipped in with 49 and 37 respectively. Anil Kumble was the best bowler for India on the day picking up 2 wickets for 42 runs. Chasing 244 under lights, India got off to a steady start losing their first wicket in the 6th over with 23 runs on the board. Wickets fell at regular intervals and this meant that India never had a chance of overhauling the South African score. Irfan Pathan was the pick of the batsmen scoring 47 runs.



For the Malayalam film, see Not Out (film) .
Look up not out in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
In cricket , a batsman will be not out if he comes out to bat in an innings and has not been dismissed by the end of the innings . One may similarly describe a batsman as not out while the innings is still in progress. A batsman's score is often appended with an asterisk to indicate that he was not out; for example, '10*' is read '10 not out'.
At least one batsman will be not out at the end of an innings, because once ten batsmen are out, the eleventh will have no partner to bat on with. Two batsmen will be not out if a declaration is made in first-class cricket , and often at the end of the scheduled number of overs in limited overs cricket . A batsman further down the batting order than the not-out batsmen will not come out to the crease at all and is noted as did not bat rather than not out; by contrast, a batsman who comes to the crease but faces no balls is not out. A batsman who retires hurt is considered not out; an uninjured batsman who retires is considered retired out .
Batting averages are calculated as runs divided by outs, which means that a player who often ends the innings not out may get an inflated batting average. [1] Examples of this include Michael Bevan (67 not outs in ODIs ), James Anderson (12 not outs in 16 Test innings), and Bill Johnston topping the batting averages on the 1953 Australian tour of England. [1] However, the flip side of the argument is that, if not outs were counted for the purpose of batting averages, a good batsman could come in and only have time to make 0 not out, facing three balls from a bowler , and thus get unduly penalised for factors out of his control. This argument is prevailing among cricket statisticians, who have used this method of collecting batting averages since the 18th century. Furthermore, a batsman will tend to be at his most vulnerable early in an innings before he has "got his eye in"; as a result it may be considered a greater achievement to achieve two scores of 20 not out and 20 (averaging 60) than to make one score of 40, since in the latter instance the batsman will only have had to negotiate the start of one innings.



Personal life[ edit ]
Laxman was born in Hyderabad , Andhra Pradesh (now Telangana ). [9] [10] Laxman's parents are, noted Physicians Dr. Shantaram and Dr. Satyabhama of Vijayawda-Guntur. [11] Laxman studied at Little Flower High School , Hyderabad . He then enrolled as a medical student but chose cricket as a career over medicine. He was awarded an honorary doctorate degree on 4 February 2015 by Teri University , New Delhi . [12] [13]
He married G. R. Shailaja from Guntur , who is a post-graduate in computer applications on 16 February 2004. [11] They have two children – a son, Sarvajit and a daughter, Achinthya.
Laxman is related to India's second President Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan . [9]
Philanthrophy[ edit ]
Recently he attended Food for Change along with Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Pulela Gopichand for the charity event of educating 2 lakh students.
Playing style[ edit ]
Laxman is known for his "wristy, willowy and sinuous" style, one which is technically fluid at its best. Laxman's on-side playing capability is comparable with his fellow Hyderabadi Mohammed Azharuddin 's. The Australians once admitted that they did not know where to bowl to him. [14] Laxman is widely criticised as a slow runner between the wickets and he is one of the few players who have played 100 Tests but have never played in the Cricket World Cup . Despite being a slow runner between wickets, Laxman could score rapidly as he was such a fine stroke player and could play freely for long periods of time.
VVS Laxman with his family at Teri University , receiving the doctoral degree.
Technically sound, Laxman stands tall and still at the crease, with a keen awareness of the off-stump and a polished ability to dispatch the bad ball. He plays with a high elbow and a steady stance and a textbook technique with natural elegance and flair. At the start of his career, Laxman was rated by Geoffrey Boycott as one of India's best current players of the hard (new) ball. Indian selectors also thought on those lines and asked Laxman to open on a number of occasions. But Laxman came into his own only when he was asked to bat in the middle order. Laxman has played some of his best match-winning innings while playing at no. 3, no. 5 and no. 6. His score of 281 against Australia rang in a new era of Indian dominance which culminated in India gaining the no. 1 spot in test cricket a few years later. His 281 is rated by many as the best ever innings played by an Indian batsman. He made that score while batting at number 3, having been moved up the order from no. 6 for the second innings of the test match.
Youth career[ edit ]
Laxman made his Under-19 debut for India against Australia in February 1994. [15] Batting at six, he made 88 in his debut innings against a bowling attack that consisted of Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie , both of who were making their debuts too. [16] In the second game of the series, Laxman scored an unbeaten 151 in the first innings and 77 in the second innings to help his team register a 226-run victory. [17] He continued his good form as he scored 36 and 84 in the third game to end up as the leading run-scorer of the series. [18] The Test series was followed by a 3-match ODI series, where he managed scores of 24, 22 and 77. [19] [20] [21] Later in August that year, the India Under-19 team toured England for 2 ODIs and 3 Test matches. [22] Laxman disappointed in the ODIs with scores of 20 and 5. [23] [24] However, in the first Test he struck 119 in the first innings, but did not get to bat in the second innings as India cruised to a 9-wicket win. [25] He made only 28 in the second match and 4 in the third. [26] [27]
Domestic cricket[ edit ]
Laxman made his first-class debut for Hyderabad against Punjab in the quarter-final match of 1992–93 Ranji Trophy season. He scored a duck in the first innings and 17 in the second. [28] He played only one match for Hyderabad in the next season, before getting dropped. [29] However, he was named in the South Zone squad for the 1994/95 Duleep Trophy in the back of his impressive outings for India Under-19s, but he failed to score big in the tournament. In the following Ranji Trophy season, Laxman notched up 532 runs from five matches at an average of 76 scoring two centuries. [30] In the semi-final of the Duleep Trophy of 1995/96 season against West Zone , Laxman scored 47 in the first innings and a spectacular 121 in the second innings, sharing a 199-run partnership with skipper Rahul Dravid . [31] He had another brilliant Ranji season the next year, as he piled 775 runs in just 11 innings at an average of 86 with 3 centuries [32] and a best of 203* that came against Karnataka in the semi-final, which Hyderabad eventually lost. [33] He was picked to play for Rest of India against Karnataka in Irani Cup and also in the Board President's XI squad against the touring Australian team. [34] He played only three matches in 1996/97 Ranji season, where he scored three half-centuries, [35] before getting picked for the Indian Test team against South Africa . [36]
Early international career (1996–2000)[ edit ]
Laxman made his Test debut in 1996 against South Africa at Ahmedabad , scoring a fifty in the second innings of the match. [37] In the second game at Kolkata , he scored 14 and 1. [38] He played just one Test in the South African tour the following month and was unable to cement his place in a star-studded Indian middle order. Instead, he was asked to open the innings, starting in West Indies in 1997. At Kingston , he scored 64 in his first innings as opener. [39] However, he averaged only 28 in that series playing as an opener. [40] But intermittently continued in this role for nearly three years, but without any consistent success. In 1998 at Calcutta , he scored 95 against Australia opening the innings with Navjot Sidhu who scored 97. [41] India went on to win the match by an innings and 219 runs. Though he was selected in the Test squad that toured New Zealand in 1998, he did not get to play a single game as Ajay Jadeja was preferred over Laxman to open the innings with Sidhu. [42] Laxman scored a duck on his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in the Pepsi Tri-Series in 1998. [43] He had a horrible run in the ODIs in 1998 which resulted in him getting dropped from the ODI team for more than a year. Against Pakistan in 1999, he scored just 66 runs from two Tests, averaging a modest 16. [44] In the first match of the Asian Test Championship later that year, Laxman scored 67 against Pakistan, but failed to score consistently, before getting dropped from the Test team as well. [45]
Laxman returned to playing first-class cricket in 1999 to regain his place in the national team. In the 1999–2000 season of Ranji Trophy, he broke the record for most runs in a Ranji season when he made 1415 runs, at an average of 108, in just 9 matches notching up eight hundreds – a record that still remains intact. His performance was rewarded when, in January 2000, he was recalled in the Indian squad for the Australian tour. He scored 167 in the third and final Test match at Sydney when the rest of the batsmen struggled to cope with Glenn McGrath 's destructive bowling, [46] a rare high point for India in an otherwise disastrous tour. Despite this success against an attack containing both McGrath and Shane Warne , Laxman apparently decided that he would return to domestic cricket, rather than continue playing as opener, a role which he believed did not suit him. As a result, Laxman was out of the Test team for nearly a year. He was recalled in late 2000, and also found a spot in the side for the home series against Australia in 2001.
Australia's tour of India (2001)[ edit ]
Laxman's career changed dramatically in the home series against Australia . In the first Test at Mumbai , Laxman made 20 and 12, as the entire Indian batting line-up, with the exception of Sachin Tendulkar , capitulated, leading to a 10-wicket defeat. [47] This was Australia's 16th consecutive Test win and extended their own world record. [48] In the next Test, however, after scoring 59 in the first innings, Laxman shot to fame with an extraordinary knock of 281 in the second innings (following on) against Australia at the Eden Gardens , when under tremendous pressure and with Australia looking set for a crushing 17th win in a row. [49] He broke Sunil Gavaskar 's long standing Indian Test record score of 236*. [50] This remained the highest ever by an Indian until it was eclipsed by Virender Sehwag 's triple ton against Pakistan in Multan in March 2004. [51] The innings also contributed to a record partnership of 376 with Rahul Dravid who made 180 and together they survived the whole 4th day. Laxman's performance was of enormous consequence: India had been on the brink of an innings defeat but went on to win the Test and the series, denying Steve Waugh 's conquest of the "final frontier". This was only the third time in the history of cricket that a team had managed to win a Test after being forced to follow on. [52] It has become one of the most celebrated tales of Indian cricket, and the innings is ranked the sixth best Test innings ever by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. [53] At the time, the pitch was taking significant turn, and to negate Laxman's free scoring, Australian leg spinner Shane Warne pitched his deliveries into the footmarks outside leg stump. However, such was Laxman's play that he consistently drove the ball through long on for boundaries against the spin, something that is considered to be technically dangerous. When Warne attempted to stop Laxman from scoring by defensively stationing most of the fielders on the leg side ( leg theory ) and bowling outside leg stump, Laxman proceeded to skip down the pitch and drive Warne inside-out through the vacant off side, hitting through the line of a substantially turning ball. Warne later admitted that he was clueless as to how to stop Laxman. Laxman went on to score 65 and 66 in the third and the final Test match at Chennai , which India won by 2 wickets and won the series 2–1. [54] Laxman had great amount of success batting at No.3 in the ODI series that followed the Tests, as he scored 45, 51, 83, 11 and 101 in the five games, thus cementing his spot in the ODI line-up as well. [55] In the Coca-Cola Tri-Series later that year in Sri Lanka, Laxman scored 212 runs in 7 matches with two fifties and a decent average of 36. [56]
West Indies and Australia tours (2002–2004)[ edit ]
Laxman then cemented his place both in the Test and one day teams for a few years. After bad performances in the Test series against Zimbabwe , he did well in the first two ODIs scoring 75 and 52, but couldn't convert the starts into big knocks in the next three matches. Laxman managed to score a fighting 89 in the second Test at Port Elizabeth , when the rest of the team struggled to survive against Shaun Pollock 's deadly bowling, helping his team put up 201 on the board and avoid an embarrassing follow-on. Against the touring England in late 2001, he scored 75, sharing a 100-plus run partnership with Tendulkar to take his team out of trouble. He had a great tour of West Indies , as he scored 474 runs in 8 innings at an average of 79. He had scores of 69, 69*, 74, 1, 43, 130, 65* and 23 in that series. He performed reasonably well during West Indies tour of India as well, particularly in the third match at Kolkata , where he scored 48 and 154*. He followed it up with brilliant showing in the 7-match ODI series as well with scores of 47, 99, 66 and 71 in the first five games. But his form dropped during India's tour of New Zealand in 2002/03. In the first Test at Wellington , he got a pair and in the second match he could score only 23 and 4. However, he had a brilliant 2-match Test series against the same team in India as he scored a half-century along with 44 in the first Test and 104* and 67* in the second match. He won the Man of the Series award for his impressive batting performances in the two Test match series. In October 2003, he scored 102 in the first ODI against Australia at Gwalior , sharing a 190-run second wicket partnership with Tendulkar. However he failed to deliver on a consistent basis in ODIs. He continued to perform well against Australia, especially during India's tour of Australia in 2003–04, in which he hit three ODI and two Test centuries. He was involved in two century partnerships, one with Tendulkar and the other with Dravid, in the Brisbane ODI against Australia where he remained unbeaten on 102. His 106* against the same opponents at Sydney saw him put up a fourth-wicket partnership of 213 runs with Yuvraj Singh , who scored his career-best 139. In the next ODI against Zimbabwe, Laxman scored a 138-ball 131, once again setting up 2 hundred-run stands. He scored 148 in the famous Adelaide Test, sharing a triple century partnership with Rahul Dravid , which India won by 4 wickets. This was their first Test victory in Australia in two decades. His innings of 178 at Sydney also came in a triple century partnership, on this occasion with Sachin Tendulkar . India went on to post 705/7 in their first innings which is their highest total in Test cricket. Laxman scored a total of 494 runs from the 4 Tests at a staggering average of 82.

History and progression of the position[ edit ]
In the middle of the nineteenth century, the game of baseball began to evolve from a sport played by amateurs for recreation into a more serious game played by professionals . [5] One of the most dramatic changes was the transition of the pitcher's delivery from an underhand motion to an overhanded throw. [5] Before the American Civil War , the pitcher's role was to initiate the action by offering an underhanded throw to the batter, in much the same way that a basketball referee offers up a jump ball to begin play. [5] Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups , catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment. [5]
As the game progressed towards professionals and became more serious, pitchers began to attempt to prevent the batter from hitting the ball by throwing faster pitches. [5] With the introduction of the called strike in 1858 , catchers began inching closer to home plate due to the rules requirement that a strikeout could only be completed by a catch. [5] The rules governing the delivery of pitches proved to be hard to enforce, and pitchers continued to stretch the boundaries of the rules until by the 1870s, the release point of pitches had reached the pitcher's waist level. [5]
These developments meant that catchers began to take on a crucial defensive role, as a pitcher's deceptive deliveries could only be effective if the catcher was capable of fielding them. [5] The progression of the catcher positioning himself closer to the plate would lead to changes in pitching deliveries that would revolutionize the sport. [5] In the 1870s, pitcher Candy Cummings was able to introduce the curveball because his catcher, Nat Hicks , fielded his position in close proximity to home plate and was able to catch the deceptive pitch. [5] Other specialized pitches such as the spitball and the knuckleball followed, which further emphasized the defensive importance of the catcher's position. [5]
The rising velocity of pitches in conjunction with catchers moving closer to home plate significantly increased the risk of injuries for catchers, especially face and hand injuries. By the late 1870s, catchers began to use padded, fingerless gloves to protect their hands, and in 1877 the first protective catcher's mask was used. [5] The first catchers to use protective masks sometimes had their courage called into question, but the effectiveness of the masks meant that they became widely accepted. [5] In the 1880s, the first padded chest protectors came into use, and in 1888 specialized catcher's mitts used on the non-throwing hand began to be used. [5]
At about the same time that catchers began fielding their position closer to home plate, baseball teams began using a less rubbery ball which led to a decline in the number of runs scored. [6] In the 1860s it was common for teams to score fifty or sixty runs in a game. [5] The combination of the new, harder ball and the continuation of the rise in pitcher's release points helped usher in what became known as the Dead-ball era . [5] The decrease in run production placed greater significance on stolen bases and bunts , which in turn emphasized the crucial defensive role played by catchers. [5] Together, the rules changes and the new protective equipment transformed the catcher's defensive role to the way that it is presently played. [5]

The catcher is usually the first to notice the tendencies, quirks, and peculiarities of each home-plate umpire . Some umpires favor high strikes , pitched balls that are technically above the strike zone but appear, to the umpire, to be good. Conversely, some umpires will call low pitches strikes even when they are slightly below the knees. Other umpires have an inside bias or an outside bias; some umpires have more than one bias; some are uniformly lenient; some have very restricted notions of the strike zone, and the pitcher will constantly feel that his pitches are unfairly judged. The catcher can exploit an umpire's tendencies by taking him into account in how he chooses to receive the ball.
The catcher can help his pitcher get more strike calls from the umpire by using a technique called "framing". This practice is a matter of a catcher keeping his mitt inside the strike zone, or as close to it as possible, when receiving the pitch, thereby giving the plate umpire the impression that the pitch is in the strike zone, even if it is not. When framing, a catcher will also hold his mitt still for a second or two so that the umpire has an opportunity to thoroughly consider his call (and, hopefully, let his innate biases influence his decision in a direction favorable to the catcher's team).
The catcher, when receiving a borderline pitch, usually has several options in how he makes the catch. He can catch the pitch in the webbing of his mitt or in the heel; he can catch the pitch on his forehand or backhand , as necessary; he can catch a low pitch with the mitt pointed upward or downward. These choices help the catcher to create a favorable presentation (or frame) for the umpire.
A variation on "framing" is called "pulling pitches". The general approach is to catch the half of the ball that is outside the strike zone and show the umpire only the half of the ball, lodged in the mitt, that is closer to the zone. The illusion is often enhanced with a slight 'tug' of the mitt (of an inch or two) toward the strike zone.
By rule the catcher must station directly back of the plate (generally in the catcher's box ) the moment a pitch is thrown but may leave at any time to catch a pitch or make a play. The moment an intentional ball leaves a pitcher's hand, the catcher must have both feet in the catcher's box. [7] The catcher is the only defensive player who is allowed to be in foul territory when a pitch is thrown. [8]
Calling the game[ edit ]
Calling the game refers to the act of catchers to decide the type of pitch delivered to home plate. [1] Catchers comprise a high percentage of baseball managers. As of April 2011 [update] 15 of 30 Major League Baseball managers were former catchers. [9] Because the catcher is considered a captain on the field (and some, such as Thurman Munson and Jason Varitek were in fact team captains), he is often in charge of planning defensive plays. The catcher will give signs to the pitcher for what pitch is to be thrown. [1] The majority of the time it is done through a number system. Each number will represent a different pitch, and then the pitcher can either agree or disagree with a shake of his or her head. [1] These signals get more complicated when a runner is on second base, because the runner's vantage point when he takes his lead gives him a direct view of the catcher's hand and a simple signal can be relayed by the runner to the batter. Signals are not always done by the number system. Varitek was known for giving signals by touching certain parts of his chest protector.[ citation needed ]
The selection of which pitch to use can depend on a wide variety of situations such as; the type of hitter that is being faced, whether there are any base runners , how many outs have been made in the inning , or the current score, among others. The responsibility for selecting the type of pitch was traditionally made by the catcher. [1] However, current form is to have the manager or a coach relay the pitch selection to the catcher, via secret hand signals to prevent the opposing team from having the advantage of knowing what the next pitch will be.
Throwing[ edit ]
A catcher nearly always throws with his right hand. Since most hitters are right-handed and stand to the left side of the plate when batting, a catcher who throws left-handed is forced to take some time to sidestep (or otherwise avoid) the right-handed hitter when he throws from behind the plate. In addition, a lefty's throw would tend to come in on the shortstop side of the bag, while a righty's throw would be on the second base side of the bag, which is where the runner is coming in. Consequently, players who are left-handed rarely play catcher. Left-handed catchers have only caught eleven big-league games since 1902, [10] and Jack Clements , who played for 17 years at the end of the nineteenth century, is the only man in the history of baseball to play more than three hundred games as a left-handed catcher. [11] However, some observers, including the famed statistician Bill James and ESPN writer Rob Neyer , [12] have suggested that the real reason that there are no left-handed catchers is because left-handed players with strong throwing arms are almost always encouraged, at an early age, to become pitchers. Benny Distefano , the last lefty thrower to catch a big-league game (in 1989), noted that lefty catchers have difficulty on bunts up the third base line and on fielding throws home for plays at the plate. [13]
Blocking balls in the dirt[ edit ]
To block balls that a pitcher throws on a bounce toward home plate (pitches that are said to be "in the dirt"), the catcher will slide his body to the left or right, as necessary, to place himself directly in the path of the ball. Once in position, he drops to his knees, places his mitt between his legs to prevent the ball from passing through, and leans forward to deaden the rebound when, and if, the ball bounces off his thigh or torso. Although inexperienced catchers may try to catch the errant pitch with his mitt, coaches often prioritize the catcher's ability to "keep the ball in front of him" than to make a catch with his mitt.[ citation needed ] Ideally, the catcher will be able to knock the ball to the ground where it will stop within arm's reach. To perform this properly, without the ball being deflected in an undesirable direction, the catcher must angle his body so that his chest is always leaning forward, toward home plate. This maneuver is often difficult, and its difficulty depends largely on how fast the ball is traveling, where it first hits the ground, the firmness of the ground it hits, and the manner in which it is spinning.
Catcher Matt Wieters blocks runner Derek Jeter from tagging home plate.
Unlike the other fielders, the catcher and pitcher must start every play in a designated area. The catcher must be behind home plate in the catcher’s box , while the pitcher must be on the pitcher’s mound , with one foot in contact with the pitcher’s rubber . Once the ball is in play, however, the catcher and pitcher, like the other fielders, can respond to any part of the field necessary to make or assist in a defensive play. [14] The defensive plays expected of catchers, aside from managing the pitcher by calling for pitches and catching them, include:
Preventing wild pitches and avoiding passed balls . Although the pitcher has a responsibility to throw with reasonable accuracy, catchers must be mobile enough to catch (or block) errant pitches. By doing so, a catcher prevents baserunners from advancing while the loose ball is retrieved. An errant pitch that eludes the catcher and allows a baserunner to take one or more additional bases is called a wild pitch . (Techniques for blocking wild pitches are described in the previous section.) A pitched ball which would require only ordinary effort to be caught or blocked by the catcher — but is nonetheless misplayed, allowing a base runner to advance — is called a "passed ball".
Fielding high pop flies , often hit at unusual angles.
Fielding weakly hit fair ground balls (including bunts ) in front of home plate in order to throw to a base to complete a groundout or a fielder's choice play. The catcher must avoid hitting the batter-runner with the thrown ball, implying that he must move to a position in which he has a clear throw to the infielder at first base.

Guarding home plate on plays in which a baserunner attempts to score a run. The catcher is often obliged to catch a ball thrown from a fielder and to tag out a runner arriving frd goal within one match. [8] [9]
In baseball , a hat-trick can mean two different things:
When a player strikes out three times in a game.
When a player hits three home runs in a game.

A hat-trick occurs in cricket when a bowler dismisses three batsmen with consecutive deliveries. The deliveries may be interrupted by an over bowled by another bowler from the other end of the pitch or the other team's innings , but must be three consecutive deliveries by the individual bowler in the same match. Only wickets attributed to the bowler count towards a hat-trick; run outs do not count.
Hat-tricks are rare, and as such are treasured by bowlers. In Test cricket history there have been just 41 hat-tricks , the first achieved by Fred Spofforth for Australia against England in 1879. In 1912, Australian Jimmy Matthews achieved the feat twice in one game against South Africa . The only other players to achieve two hat-tricks are Australia's Hugh Trumble , against England in 1902 and 1904, Pakistan 's Wasim Akram , in separate games against Sri Lanka in 1999, and England's Stuart Broad .
In One Day International cricket there have been 36 hat-tricks , the first by Jalal-ud-Din for Pakistan against Australia in 1982, and the most recent by JP Duminy of South Africa , playing in the World Cup quarter final against Sri Lanka on 18 March 2015 at the Sydney Cricket Ground . [10]
Lasith Malinga achieved a hat-trick while playing for Sri Lanka against Australia on 22 August 2011 in the last match of the five-ODI series in Colombo. He is the only bowler to take three hat-tricks in any form of international cricket. Three players have taken at least two ODI hat-tricks in their careers: Wasim Akram and Saqlain Mushtaq of Pakistan and Chaminda Vaas of Sri Lanka . (Akram therefore has four international hat-tricks in total).
In Twenty20 International Cricket, Brett Lee of Australia had a hat-trick against Bangladesh in the Super Eight of the Twenty20 World Cup on 16 September 2007 in South Africa. Jacob Oram of New Zealand made a hat-trick against Sri Lanka on 2 September 2009 in Colombo, And Tim Southee , also from New Zealand, made a hat-trick against Pakistan, and ended up with a 5-For at the end of the match. [11]
Taking two wickets in two consecutive deliveries is occasionally known as a brace, or (more commonly, especially until the next delivery has been made) being on a hat-trick.
The feat of taking four wickets in four balls [12] has occurred only once in international one-day cricket, in the 2007 World Cup , when Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga managed the feat against South Africa by dismissing Shaun Pollock , Andrew Hall , Jacques Kallis and Makhaya Ntini , though it has occurred on other occasions in first-class cricket . Kevan James of Hampshire took four wickets in four balls and scored a century in the same county game against India in 1996. The Cricinfo report on the game claimed that this was unique in cricket. [13] [14]
Nuwan Zoysa of Sri Lanka is the only bowler to achieve a hat-trick off his first three balls in a Test, dismissing Murray Goodwin , Neil Johnson and Trevor Gripper of Zimbabwe, [15] in 1999, while Irfan Pathan of India also holds the distinction of achieving a hat-trick in the very first over of the test match but of the 4,5,6 deliveries when he dismissed Salman Butt , Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf of Pakistan in 2006, Karachi . Chaminda Vaas is the only one to achieve a hat-trick of the very first deliveries in one day internationals, against Bangladesh in 10th match of ICC World Cup 2003, played at City Oval, Pietermaritzburg . He got Hannan Sarkar , Mohammad Ashraful and Ehsanul Haque out in the first three balls and took his fourth wicket in the fifth ball of the same over just missing the double-hat-trick.
Albert Trott and Joginder Rao are the only two bowlers credited with two hat-tricks in the same innings in first class cricket. One of Trott's two hat-tricks, for Middlesex against Somerset at Lords in 1907, was a four in four.
Some hat-tricks are particularly extraordinary. On 2 December 1988, Merv Hughes , playing for Australia, dismissed Curtly Ambrose with the last ball of his penultimate over and Patrick Patterson with the first ball of his next over, wrapping up the West Indies first innings. When Hughes returned to bowl in the West Indies second innings, he trapped Gordon Greenidge lbw with his first ball, completing a hat-trick over two different innings and becoming the only player in Test cricket history to achieve the three wickets of a hat-trick in three different overs.
In 1844, underarm bowler William Clark, playing for "England" against Kent, achieved a hat-trick spread over two innings, dismissing Kent batsman John Fagge twice within the hat-trick. Fagge batted at number 11 in the first innings and at number 3 in the second. This event is believed to be unique in first-class cricket. [16]
The most involved hat-trick was perhaps when Melbourne club cricketer Stephen Hickman, playing for Power House, achieved a hat-trick spread over three overs, two days, two innings, involving the same batsman twice, and observed by the same non-striker, with the hat-trick ball being bowled from the opposite end to the first two. In the Mercantile Cricket Association C Grade semi-final at Fawkner Park South Yarra in Melbourne, Gunbower United Cricket Club were 8 for 109 when Hickman came on to bowl his off spin. He took a wicket with the last ball of his third over and then bowled number 11 batsman Richard Higgins with the first ball of his next over to complete the Gunbower innings, leaving Chris Taylor the not out batsman. Power House scored 361 putting the game out of reach of Gunbower. In the second innings opener Taylor was joined by Higgins at the fall of the fourth wicket as Hickman returned to the attack. With his first ball, observed by an incredulous Taylor at the non-striker's end, he clean bowled Higgins leaving Higgins with a pair of golden ducks . [17]
A triple hat-trick was achieved by Scott Babot of Wainuiomata Cricket Club playing in the Senior 3 competition in New Zealand in 2008. It consisted of five wickets in five balls, across two innings and separated by seven days, as the match took place on consecutive Saturdays. [18]
Darts[ edit ]
A hat-trick in darts is a score of three consecutive bullseyes , also known as the "Alan Evans Shot", after Alan Evans scored three bulleyes during a match on numerous occasions. [19]
Hockey[ edit ]
Hats on the Verizon Center ice after Alexander Ovechkin 's hat trick, 7 February 2010.
In both field hockey and ice hockey , a hat trick occurs when a player scores three goals in a single game. A hat trick, as it is known in its current form, culminates with fans throwing hats onto the ice from the stands. The tradition is said to have begun among fans in the National Hockey League around the 1950s. [20]
There are several conflicting legends of how the "hat trick" was popularized in professional hockey. Most stories involve hats being awarded to any of the local players who scored three goals in a game. According to the NHL , in the 1940s, a Toronto haberdasher used to give free hats to players with the Toronto Maple Leafs when they scored three goals in a game, which introduced the "Hat Trick" expression into the world of hockey. [21]
Montreal hatter Henri Henri makes a similar claim, that between 1950 and 1970 they would reward any NHL player who scored three or more goals in a game at the Montreal Forum with a free hat. [22]
Finally, in the 1950s, the Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters of the Ontario Hockey Association , who were then a farm team of the NHL's New York Rangers , were sponsored by Guelph-based Biltmore Hats, a leading manufacturer of hats with North American dominance. The sponsor would award any Madhatters player who scored three goals in a game with a new fedora . [23]
In a slightly different account, the expression originates not with any member of a team, but with a particular player. According to legend, Chicago Blackhawks forward Alex Kaleta entered the shop of Toronto businessman Sammy Taft to purchase a new hat, but did not have enough money. Taft arranged a deal with Kaleta stipulating that if Kaleta scored three goals as he played the Toronto Maple Leafs that night, Taft would give him a free hat. That night, on 26 January 1946, Kaleta scored four goals against the Maple Leafs and Taft made good on his offer. [24] This is the story accepted as the origin of the phrase by the Hockey Hall of Fame. [25]
Wayne Gretzky holds the NHL record for the most hat tricks in a career with 50.
Variations[ edit ]
A natural hat trick occurs when a player scores three consecutive goals, uninterrupted by any other player scoring for either team. [26]
The NHL record for the fastest natural hat trick is 21 seconds, set by Bill Mosienko in 1952 for the Chicago Blackhawks. [27]
A player accomplishes a Gordie Howe hat trick by scoring a goal, getting an assist, and getting in a fight, all in the same game (Howe himself only recorded two in his career). While this description has remained popular, it does not satisfy the conditions of a traditional hat trick. [28]
In December 1995, Florida Panthers captain Scott Mellanby scored a rat trick , the term coined by teammate John Vanbiesbrouck . Prior to the game, Mellanby killed an unwanted rat in the Panthers' locker room with his hockey stick , and proceeded to score a pair of goals later that night. [29] When Mellanby scored a hat trick in a later game, some Florida fans threw plastic rats on the ice, a tradition that continued for all Panthers' goals throughout the 1996 playoffs . Due to the resulting game delays caused by the necessary clean-up of the plastic rats, the league eventually banned the activity and modified Rule 63 to impose a minor penalty against the home team for a violation. [30] The more traditional practice of fans throwing hats on the ice following genuine hat tricks remains exempt from this penalty.

Early life and career[ edit ]
Kieswetter was born in Johannesburg to an Afrikaner father, Wayne, and Scottish mother, Belinda. [2] [3] He grew up in South Africa, studying at Diocesan College in Cape Town , and played cricket for Western Province junior teams between the ages of 13 to 18. Kieswetter was disappointed with the way he was treated by the provincial team, who had asked him to play two or three years of club cricket before returning to them, so he decided to pursue his cricket career in England. [2] He studied for a year at Millfield , where he gained his A-levels. Mark Davis , a former Somerset bowler, spotted him at Millfield, and he was quickly signed by the county. [4] He represented South Africa in the 2006 Under-19s World Cup in Sri Lanka , and won a Man of the Match award in the game against the United States for his innings of 80 off just 66 balls . [5]
Kieswetter made his first appearance for Somerset's second team in May 2006, taking over from Sam Spurway as wicket-keeper midway through a match when the latter was injured. [6] He scored 94 not out in his first innings of that match against Glamorgan , [7] and by the end of the season he had scored 245 runs at an average of over 40. [8] His performances were so strong that Somerset chose to release Spurway at the start of the 2007 season , and named Kieswetter alongside Carl Gazzard as their two wicket-keepers. In early April that year, he made his one-day debut for Somerset against Glamorgan ; he made 69 not out off 58 deliveries and took a catch described as "world class" by Somerset's director of cricket, Brian Rose . [4] He made his first-class debut the following month, keeping wicket while Derbyshire made 801 for 8 declared [a] and scored 63 in the Somerset reply. [9]
He continued to perform well during 2007 and 2008 , and was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award , as the "most promising young player", for Somerset in both seasons, [1] scoring regular fifties in both first-class and one-day cricket. [10] [11] Notable among these innings was the 93 he scored against Glamorgan while batting at number eight . Kieswetter came in after two wickets had been lost in an over, with the score at 250 for 6. His innings, which included a partnership of 130 with Andrew Caddick , helped Somerset to reach 402 and eventually win the match. [12] [13] Towards the end of the 2008 season, during a 40-over match against Gloucestershire , Kieswetter scored his first century for Somerset, scoring 121 runs from 107 deliveries, and sharing a competition-record 302-run partnership with Marcus Trescothick . [6]
In 2009, Kieswetter passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the only time during his career. [10] He scored his maiden first-class century early in the year, accumulating an unbeaten 150 in a high-scoring draw against Warwickshire . [14] A few weeks later, he repeated the feat, scoring 106 runs against Durham to help his county avoid defeat. In his report for ESPNcricinfo , Andrew McGlashan described Kieswetter as "another likely South African to make the transition to England colours". [15] Kieswetter scored two further first-class centuries during the year, both at Taunton , against Sussex and Lancashire ; he averaged just under 60 for his 1,242 first-class runs in the year. [10] In one-day cricket, Kieswetter opened the batting alongside Trescothick, and averaged 65.83, scoring an unbeaten 138 off just 131 balls in the opening group match against Warwickshire . [16] [17] In the quarter-final of the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy , Kieswetter scored his second one-day century of the season, but Somerset were defeated by six wickets and knocked out of the competition. [18] His 248 runs in the 2009 Twenty20 Cup helped Somerset reach the final of that competition, where they were again beaten by Sussex. [19] He was awarded his county cap during the final game of the 2009 County Championship against Worcestershire . [20]
International selection[ edit ]
Following his strong performances for Somerset, Kieswetter was part of the England Performance Programme squad that spent eight weeks of the English winter training in Loughborough and Pretoria . [21] The South African national cricket captain, Graeme Smith , said that he wanted Kieswetter to return to play cricket in South Africa; rather than directly inviting him to play for the South Africa national cricket team , however, he was careful to state that "the challenge is to get him back into our franchise system first, but he is certainly someone we have seen and would like to get back into the system". [22] Kieswetter repeated his desire to play international cricket for England [22] and, in January 2010, he was named as part of the England Lions squad to tour the United Arab Emirates for a series against Pakistan A . [23] The England head coach, Andy Flower , described Kieswetter's performances during that tour as "a really good start", and described the Twenty20 warm-up match between the England Lions and the England senior team that followed the tour as "a chance for him to impress". [24] During that match, which was played on the day that he qualified for England, Kieswetter scored 81 runs to help the Lions beat the senior team. [25] Kieswetter qualified to play for England on the basis of having a British passport, via his Scottish mother, and his residency in England. He had to wait until four years after his last appearance for South Africa, which was on 16 February 2006 during the Under-19s World Cup. [26]

After England's drawn T20I series with Pakistan , Kieswetter was added to the senior England squad for the ODI series against Bangladesh . [27] He was immediately included in the team, playing as a specialist batsman alongside wicket-keeper Matt Prior , in the first warm-up match on 23 February against the "Bangladesh Cricket Board XI". He scored 143, his career-best List A score, from 123 balls. [28] These performances led to Kieswetter's selection for the first ODI against Bangladesh on 28 February.

  Putrajaya
1 February 2001
Malaysia is a federation of 13 states and three federal territories. [120] These are divided between two regions, with 11 states and two federal territories on Peninsular Malaysia and the other two states and one federal territory in East Malaysia . Each state is divided into districts , which are then divided into mukim . In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into divisions. [121]
Governance of the states is divided between the federal and the state governments, with different powers reserved for each, and the Federal government has direct administration of the federal territories. [122] Lower-level administration is carried out by local authorities, which include city councils, district councils, and municipal councils, although autonomous statutory bodies can be created by the federal and state governments to deal with certain tasks. [123] The federal constitution puts local authorities outside of the federal territories under the exclusive jurisdictions of the state government, [124] although in practice the federal government has intervened in the affairs of state local governments. [125] There are 144 local authorities, consisting of 11 city councils, 33 municipal councils, and 97 district councils. [126]
The 13 states are based on historical Malay kingdoms, and 9 of the 11 Peninsular states, known as the Malay states , retain their royal families. The King is elected by and from the nine rulers to serve a five-year term. [7] This King appoints governors serving a four-year term for the states without monarchies, after consultations with the chief minister of that state. Each state has a unicameral legislature known as the State Legislative Assembly , and its own written constitution. [127] Sabah and Sarawak have considerably more autonomy than the other states, most notably having separate immigration policies and controls, and a unique residency status. [128] [129] [130] In recent situation, there have been some unwarranted calls for separation from several states such as Johor , Kelantan , Sabah and Sarawak due to certain issues such as federal government intervention on states affairs, lack of developments and dispute on share of oil royalties . [131] [132] [133]
Geography
Main article: Geography of Malaysia
Malaysia is within the equatorial region , where a tropical rainforest climate is apparent all year round.
Malaysia is the 67th largest country by total land area , with a land area of 329,847 km2 (127,355 sq mi). It has land borders with Thailand in West Malaysia, and Indonesia and Brunei in East Malaysia. [6] It is linked to Singapore by a narrow causeway and a bridge. The country also has maritime boundaries with Vietnam [134] and the Philippines. [135] The land borders are defined in large part by geological features such as the Perlis River , the Golok River and the Pagalayan Canal, whilst some of the maritime boundaries are the subject of ongoing contention. [6] Brunei forms what is almost an enclave in Malaysia, [136] with the state of Sarawak dividing it into two parts. Malaysia is the only country with territory on both the Asian mainland and the Malay archipelago. [137] Tanjung Piai , located in the southern state of Johor , is the southernmost tip of continental Asia. [138] The Strait of Malacca , lying between Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, is one of the most important thoroughfares in global commerce, carrying 40 per cent of the world's trade. [139]
The two parts of Malaysia, separated from each other by the South China Sea , share a largely similar landscape in that both Peninsular and East Malaysia feature coastal plains rising to hills and mountains. [6] Peninsular Malaysia, containing 40 per cent of Malaysia's land area, [137] extends 740 km (460 mi) from north to south, and its maximum width is 322 km (200 mi). [140] It is divided between its east and west coasts by the Titiwangsa Mountains , [141] rising to a peak elevation of 2,183 metres (7,162 ft) at Mount Korbu , [142] part of a series of mountain ranges running down the centre of the peninsula. [137] These mountains are heavily forested, [143] and mainly composed of granite and other igneous rocks. Much of it has been eroded, creating a karst landscape. [137] The range is the origin of some of Peninsular Malaysia's river systems. [143] The coastal plains surrounding the peninsula reach a maximum width of 50 kilometres (31 mi), and the peninsula's coastline is nearly 1,931 km (1,200 mi) long, although harbours are only available on the western side. [140] Malaysia is the only sovereign Austronesian -speaking nation with territory on the Asian mainland.
The limestone pinnacles at Mount Api , part of the Gunung Mulu National Park .
East Malaysia, on the island of Borneo , has a coastline of 2,607 km (1,620 mi). [6] It is divided between coastal regions, hills and valleys, and a mountainous interior. [137] The Crocker Range extends northwards from Sarawak, [137] dividing the state of Sabah. It is the location of the 4,095 m (13,435 ft) high Mount Kinabalu , [144] [145] the tallest mountain in Malaysia. Mount Kinabalu is located in the Kinabalu National Park , which is protected as one of the four UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Malaysia . [146] The highest mountain ranges form the border between Malaysia and Indonesia. Sarawak contains the Mulu Caves, the largest cave system in the world, in the Gunung Mulu National Park which is also a World Heritage Site. [137]
Around these two halves of Malaysia are numerous islands , the largest of which is Banggi . [147] The local climate is equatorial and characterised by the annual southwest (April to October) and northeast (October to February) monsoons . [140] The temperature is moderated by the presence of the surrounding oceans. [137] Humidity is usually high, and the average annual rainfall is 250 cm (98 in). [140] The climates of the Peninsula and the East differ, as the climate on the peninsula is directly affected by wind from the mainland, as opposed to the more maritime weather of the East. Local climates can be divided into three regions, highland, lowland, and coastal. Climate change is likely to affect sea levels and rainfall, increasing flood risks and leading to droughts. [137]
Biodiversity
Some examples of Malaysian wildlife shown from clockwise: Hornbill , hawksbill sea turtle , proboscis monkey and the Malayan tiger .
Malaysia signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1993, and became a party to the convention on 24 June 1994. [148] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan , which was received by the convention on 16 April 1998. [149] The country is megadiverse with a high number of species and high levels of endemism . [150] It is estimated to contain 20 per cent of the world's animal species. [151] High levels of endemism are found on the diverse forests of Borneo's mountains, as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest. [137] There are about 210 mammal species in the country. [144] Over 620 species of birds have been recorded in Peninsular Malaysia, [151] with many endemic to the mountains there. A high number of endemic bird species are also found in Malaysian Borneo. [137] 250 reptile species have been recorded in the country, with about 150 species of snakes [152] and 80 species of lizards. [144] There are about 150 species of frogs, [144] and thousands of insect species. [144] Malaysia's exclusive economic zone is 1.5 times larger than its land area, [153] and some of its waters are in the Coral Triangle , a biodiversity hotspot. [154] The waters around Sipadan island are the most biodiverse in the world. [151] Bordering East Malaysia, the Sulu Sea is a biodiversity hotspot, with around 600 coral species and 1200 fish species. [155] The unique biodiversity of Malaysian Caves always attracts lovers of ecotourism from all over the world. [156]
Some species of Rafflesia can grow up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) in diameter, making them the largest flowers in the world.
Nearly 4,000 species of fungi, including lichen-forming species have been recorded from Malaysia. Of the two fungal groups with the largest number of species in Malaysia, the Ascomycota and their asexual states have been surveyed in some habitats (decaying wood, marine and freshwater ecosystems, as parasites of some plants, and as agents of biodegradation), but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats (as endobionts, in soils, on dung, as human and animal pathogens); the Basidiomycota are only partly surveyed: bracket fungi, and mushrooms and toadstools have been studied, but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain very poorly known. Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely that many of those, when found, will be new to science. [157]
About two thirds of Malaysia is covered in forest, [140] with some forests believed to be 130 million years old. [144] The forests are dominated by dipterocarps . [158] Lowland forest covers areas below 760 m (2,490 ft), [140] and formerly East Malaysia was covered in such rainforest , [158] which is supported by its hot wet climate. [137] There are around 14,500 species of flowering plants and trees. [144] Besides rainforests, there are over 1,425 km2 (550 sq mi) of mangroves in Malaysia, [140] and a large amount of peat forest. At higher altitudes, oaks, chestnuts, and rhododendrons replace dipterocarps. [137] There are an estimated 8,500 species of vascular plants in Peninsular Malaysia, with another 15,000 in the East. [159] The forests of East Malaysia are estimated to be the habitat of around 2,000 tree species, and are one of the most biodiverse areas in the world, with 240 different species of trees every hectare. [137] These forests host many members of the Rafflesia genus, the largest flowers in the world, [158] with a maximum diameter of 1 m (3 ft 3 in). [160]
Conservation issues
Main article: Environmental issues in Malaysia
Logging, along with cultivation practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80 per cent of Sarawak's rainforest has been cleared. [137] Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened by the loss of trees, and over 60 per cent of the Peninsular's forest have been cleared. [160] With current rates of deforestation, the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. [137] Deforestation is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, as the forest is cut to make room for plantations. [161] Most remaining forest is found inside national parks. [160] Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life. [155] Illegal fishing is another major threat, [155] with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. [162] Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98 per cent since the 1950s. [152] Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, [160] with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life [155] to tigers. [161] Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism. [163]
The Malaysian government aims to balance economic growth with environmental protection, but has been accused of favouring big business over the environment. [160] Some state governments are now trying to counter the environmental impact and pollution created by deforestation; [158] and the federal government is trying to cut logging by 10 per cent each year. 28 national parks have been established; 23 in East Malaysia and five in the Peninsular. [160] Tourism has been limited in biodiverse areas such as Sipadan island. [163] Animal trafficking is a large issue, and the Malaysian government is holding talks with the governments of Brunei and Indonesia to standardise anti-trafficking laws. [164]
Economy

Kuala Lumpur, the main economic centre of Malaysia.
Malaysia is a relatively open state-oriented and newly industrialised market economy . [165] [166] The state plays a significant but declining role in guiding economic activity through macroeconomic plans. Malaysia has had one of the best economic records in Asia, with GDP growing an average 6.5 per cent annually from 1957 to 2005. [7] Malaysia's economy in 2014–2015 was one of the most competitive in Asia, ranking 6th in Asia and 20th in the world, higher than countries like Australia , France and South Korea . [167] In 2014, Malaysia's economy grew 6%, the second highest growth in ASEAN behind Philippines' growth of 6.1%. [168] The economy of Malaysia (GDP PPP) in 2014 was $746.821 billion, the third largest in ASEAN behind more populous Indonesia and Thailand and the 28th largest in the world . [169]
In 1991, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad outlined his ideal in Vision 2020 , in which Malaysia would become a self-sufficient industrialised nation by 2020. [170] Najib Razak has said Malaysia could attain developed country status much earlier from the actual target in 2020, adding the country has two program concept such as Government Transformation Programme and the Economic Transformation Programme . [171]
According to a HSBC report, Malaysia will become the world's 21st largest economy by 2050, with a GDP of $1.2 trillion (Year 2000 dollars) and a GDP per capita of $29,247 (Year 2000 dollars). The report also says "The electronic equipment, petroleum, and liquefied natural gas producer will see a substantial increase in income per capita. Malaysian life expectancy, relatively high level of schooling, and above average fertility rate will help in its rapid expansion". [172] Viktor Shvets, the managing director of Credit Suisse , has said "Malaysia has all the right ingredients to become a developed nation". [173]
In the 1970s, the predominantly mining and agricultural-based economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s, the industrial sector, with a high level of investment, has led the country's growth. [7] [174] The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis earlier than neighbouring countries did, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800. [175] [176] Economic inequalities exist between different ethnic groups. The Chinese make up about one-quarter of the population, but accounts for 70 per cent of the country's market capitalisation. [177] Chinese businesses in Malaysia are part of the larger bamboo network , a network of overseas Chinese businesses in the Southeast Asian market sharing common family and cultural ties. [178]
The Petronas Towers house the headquarters of the national oil company Petronas and are the tallest twin-towers in the world.
International trade, facilitated by the shipping route in adjacent Strait of Malacca , and manufacturing are the key sectors. [179] [180] [181] Malaysia is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources, and petroleum is a major export. [7] Malaysia has once been the largest producer of tin , [182] rubber and palm oil in the world. Manufacturing has a large influence in the country's economy, [183] although Malaysia's economic structure has been moving away from it. [184] Malaysia remains one of the world's largest producers of palm oil. [185]
In an effort to diversify the economy and make it less dependent on export goods, the government has pushed to increase tourism to Malaysia . As a result, tourism has become Malaysia's third largest source of foreign exchange, although it is threatened by the negative effects of the growing industrial economy, with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism. [186] The tourism sector came under some pressure in 2014 when the national carrier Malaysia Airlines had one of its planes disappear in March, while another was brought down by a missile over Ukraine in July, resulting in the loss of a total 537 passengers and crew. The state of the airline, which had been unprofitable for 3 years, prompted the government in August 2014 to nationalise the airline by buying up the 30 per cent it did not already own. [187] Between 2013 and 2014, Malaysia has been listed as one of the best places to retire in the world too, with the country in third position on the Global Retirement Index. This in part was the result of the Malaysia My Second Home programme to allow foreigners to live in the country on a long-stay visa for up to 10 years. [188] In 2015, Malaysia ranked in fourth position on The World's Best Retirement Havens while getting in the first place as the best place in Asia to retire. Warm climate with British colonial background made foreigners easy to interact with the locals. [189]
The country has developed into a centre of Islamic banking , and is the country with the highest numbers of female workers in that industry. [190] Knowledge-based services are also expanding. [184] To create a self-reliant defensive ability and support national development, Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s. The privatisation has created defence industry, which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia Defence Industry Council . The government continues to promote this sector and its competitiveness, actively marketing the defence industry. [191]
Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, electrical devices, and IT and communication products. [7] Malaysia began developing its own space programme in 2002, [192] [193] and in 2006, Russia agreed to transport one Malaysian to the International Space Station as part of a multibillion-dollar purchase of 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets by the Royal Malaysian Air Force . [194] The government has invested in building satellites in through the RazakSAT programme. [195]
Infrastructure
The overall infrastructure of Malaysia is one of the most developed in Asia [196] and ranked 8th in Asia and 25th in the world. [197] Malaysia is ranked 19th in the world for its quality roads, quality of port infrastructure and quality of air transport infrastructure but ranked 39th in quality of electricity supply. [197] Its telecommunications network is second only to Singapore's in Southeast Asia, with 4.7 million fixed-line subscribers and more than 30 million cellular subscribers. [198] [199] The country has seven international ports, the major one being the Port Klang . There are 200 industrial parks along with specialised parks such as Technology Park Malaysia and Kulim Hi-Tech Park . [200] Fresh water is available to over 95 per cent of the population. During the colonial period, development was mainly concentrated in economically powerful cities and in areas forming security concerns. Although rural areas have been the focus of great development, they still lag behind areas such as the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. [201] The telecommunication network, although strong in urban areas, is less available to the rural population. [198]
Energy
Bakun Dam under construction in 2009
Malaysia's energy infrastructure sector is largely dominated by Tenaga Nasional , the largest electric utility company in Southeast Asia , with over RM99.03 billion of assets. Customers are connected to electricity through the National Grid , with more than 420 transmission substations in the Peninsular linked together by approximately 11,000 km [202] of transmission lines operating at 132, 275 and 500 kilovolts . In 2013, Malaysia's total power generation capacity was over 29,728 megawatts . Total electricity generation was 140,985.01 GWh and total electricity consumption was 116,087.51 GWh . [203] Energy production in Malaysia is largely based on oil and natural gas, owing to Malaysia's oil reserves and natural gas reserves, which is the fourth largest in Asia-Pacific after China , India and Vietnam . [204]
Transportation
The North–South Expressway , the longest highway in Malaysia
Malaysia's road network is one of the most comprehensive in Asia and covers a total of 144,403 kilometres (89,728 mi). The main national road network is the Malaysian Federal Roads System , which span over 49,935 km (31,028 mi). Most of the federal roads in Malaysia are 2-lane roads. In town areas, federal roads may become 4-lane roads to increase traffic capacity. Nearly all federal roads are paved with tarmac except parts of the Skudai–Pontian Highway which is paved with concrete , while parts of the Federal Highway linking Klang to Kuala Lumpur, is paved with asphalt . Malaysia has over 1,798 kilometres (1,117 mi) of highways and the longest highway, the North–South Expressway , extends over 800 kilometres (497 mi) on the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia , connecting major urban centres like Kuala Lumpur , Penang and Johor Bahru . In 2015, the government announced a RM27 billion (US$8.23 billion) Pan-Borneo Highway project to upgrade all trunk roads to dual carriage expressways , bringing the standard of East Malaysian highways to the same level of quality of Peninsular highways. [205] [206]

There is currently 1,833 kilometres (1,139 mi) of railways in Malaysia, 767 km (477 mi) are double tracked and electrified . Rail transport in Malaysia comprises heavy rail ( KTM ), light rapid transit and monorail ( Rapid Rail ), and a funicular railway line ( Penang Hill Railway ). Heavy rail is mostly used for intercity passenger and freight transport as well as some urban public transport, while LRTs are used for intra-city urban public transport. There two commuter rail services linking Kuala Lumpur with the Kuala Lumpur International Airport . The sole monorail line in the country is also used for public transport in Kuala Lumpur , while the only funicular railway line is in Penang . A rapid transit project, the KVMRT , is currently under construction to improve Kuala Lumpur 's public transport system. The railway network covers most of the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia . In East Malaysia, only the state of Sabah has railways. The network is also connected to the Thai railway 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄
8
 in) network in the north. If the Burma Railway is rebuilt, services to Myanmar, India, and China could be initiated.
Kuala Lumpur International Airport , Malaysia's busiest airport
Malaysia has 118 airports, of which 38 are paved. The national airline is Malaysia Airlines , providing international and domestic air services. Major international routes and domestic routes crossing between West Malaysia and East Malaysia are served by Malaysia Airlines , AirAsia and Malindo Air while smaller domestic routes are supplemented by smaller airlines like MASwings , Firefly and Berjaya Air . Major cargo airlines include MASkargo and Transmile Air Services . Kuala Lumpur International Airport is the main and busiest airport of Malaysia. In 2014, it was the world's 13th busiest airport by international passenger traffic , recording over 25.4 million international passenger traffic. It was also the world's 20th busiest airport by passenger traffic , recording over 48.9 million passengers. Other major airports include Kota Kinabalu International Airport , which is also Malaysia's second busiest airport and busiest airport in East Malaysia with over 6.9 million passengers in 2013, and Penang International Airport , which serves Malaysia's second largest urban area, with over 5.4 million passengers in 2013.
Port Klang in Selangor, the busiest port in Malaysia.
Malaysia is strategically located on the Strait of Malacca , one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. Malaysia has two ports that are listed in the top 20 busiest ports in the world, Port Klang and Port of Tanjung Pelepas , which are respectively the 2nd and 3rd busiest ports in Southeast Asia after the Port of Singapore . Port Klang is Malaysia's busiest port, and the 13th busiest port in the world in 2013, handling over 10.3 million TEUs . Port of Tanjung Pelepas is Malaysia's second busiest port, and the 19th busiest port in the world in 2013, handling over 7.6 million TEUs.
Water supply and sanitation
Main article: Water supply and sanitation in Malaysia
Universal access to water supply at affordable tariffs is a substantial achievement. The government has also shown a commitment to make the sector more efficient, to create a sustainable funding mechanism and to improve the customer orientation of service providers through sector reforms enacted in 2006. The reform creates a modern institutional structure for the water sector, including an autonomous regulatory agency, an asset management company and commercialised state water companies that have to reach certain key performance indicators that will be monitored by the regulatory agency. The government has also stated its intention not to embark on new private sector contracts for water provision, after a bout of such contracts during the 1990s showed mixed results.
Despite those achievements, a number of challenges remain, only some of which have been addressed by the reforms. First, tariffs are low, thus making cost recovery impossible at current levels so that the sector continues to depend on government subsidies. Second, water losses as well as per capita water use remain high despite efforts at water demand management. Third, a large-scale water transfer project from the Pahang River to Kuala Lumpur is controversial because of its negative social and environmental impacts. Fourth, the development of sewerage and wastewater treatment has lagged behind the development of water infrastructure. For example, much of the collected wastewater is not yet being treated. The sanitation sub-sector has been excluded in the 2006 reforms of the water supply sub-sector.
Demographics
Main article: Demographics of Malaysia
The percentage distribution of Malaysian population by ethnic group based on 2010 census.
As of the 2010 census, the population of Malaysia was 28,334,135, [12] making it the 42nd most populated country . The population of Malaysia consists of many ethnic groups. In 2010, Malaysian citizens, of which bumiputera were 67.4%, made up 91.8% of the population. [207] According to constitutional definition, Malays are Muslims who practice Malay customs and culture. They play a dominant role politically. [208] Bumiputera status is also accorded to certain non-Malay indigenous peoples , including ethnic Thais , Khmers , Chams and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak. Non-Malay bumiputera make up more than half of Sarawak's population and over two thirds of Sabah's population. [6] There also exist aboriginal groups in much smaller numbers on the peninsula, where they are collectively known as the Orang Asli . [209] Laws over who gets bumiputera status vary between states. [210]
Other minorities who lack bumiputera status make up a large amount of the population. 24.6 per cent of the population are of Chinese descent , while those of Indian descent comprise 7.3 per cent of the population. [207] The Chinese have historically been dominant in the business and commerce community, and form a plurality of the population of Penang . Immigrants from India, the majority of them Tamils , began arriving in Malaysia early in the 19th century. [211] [212] Malaysian citizenship is not automatically granted to those born in Malaysia, but is granted to a child born of two Malaysian parents outside Malaysia. Dual citizenship is not permitted. [213] Citizenship in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo are distinct from citizenship in Peninsular Malaysia for immigration purposes. Every citizen is issut was missed by wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim , and surviving a leg before wicket appeal two balls later. [29] He made 19 runs in an innings described by ESPNcricinfo ‍ '​s Andrew Miller as "tinged with nerves" and "chancy". [30] In the next match, two days later, Kieswetter was dropped by Mushfiqur Rahim off a thick edge that went for four on first ball he faced; he was then caught at first-slip off a similar thick edge to first-slip on the next next delivery. [31] In the third match, however, he scored his first international century – 107 runs – which helped England to 284 for five and a 45-run victory. England won the series 3–0. [32] In contrast to the "hard-hitting batting" which Geoff Miller , the England selector, had cited as one of the reasons for his inclusion, [27] Kieswetter's century was patiently built after a nervous start. [33]
When the England squad was announced for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 , Kieswetter was named as the only wicket-keeper in the squad, replacing Prior. [34] Kieswetter opened the innings with Michael Lumb throughout the tournament, and ESPNcricinfo‍ '​s Andrew McGlashan identified their performances as one of the reasons that England reached the final . [35] During the final, Kieswetter was England's top-scorer, hitting 63 runs from 49 deliveries, and was named as the man of the match as England won their first ICC global title. [36] During the tournament, Kieswetter scored 222 runs, the fourth-most of any player, at an average of 31.71 and a strike rate of 116.84. [37]
Dropped and recalled by England[ edit ]
After returning to England, Kieswetter's form dipped, and he scored 121 runs from eight ODIs against Australia and Bangladesh. [38] As a result, when England played five ODIs against Pakistan in September, Kieswetter was omitted and Worcestershire 's Steven Davies was preferred, although Kieswetter was included in the T20I squad. [39] Kieswetter opened the innings alongside Davies, who was playing as wicket-keeper, in the two T20Is, but only made scores of six and sixteen. [40] Although he was named in the T20I squad for the tour of Australia, he was not selected to play, and instead took part in the England Performance Programme XI tour, before joining up with the England Lions to take part in the Regional Four Day Competition in the West Indies. During the competition, Kieswetter scored two centuries, against the Leeward Islands and the Combined Campuses and Colleges . [41] [42]

Kieswetter began the 2011 season strongly for Somerset, scoring 308 runs in his first four one-day matches, including two centuries. [43] Another century, in the County Championship prompted Jeremy James of ESPNcricinfo to ask "whether Craig Kieswetter will regain his place in England's one-day side before Jos Buttler assumes it ahead of him". [44] His form earned him a recall to England's one-day squads for the series against Sri Lanka, with Geoff Miller saying "[Kieswetter] will offer some real fire power with the bat along with his ability with the gloves". [45] In his first match back for England, the Twenty20 match, Kieswetter only scored four runs, [46] but he was England's top-scorer in the first ODI match, with 61 runs, and was described as "England's most impressive batsman". [47] He struck another half-century in the fourth match of the series: he scored 72 not out as England won by ten wickets. [48] A week later, playing for Somerset against Nottinghamshire , he scored the highest score of his first-class career, accumulating 164 runs as part of a 290-run partnership with James Hildreth . [49]
Kieswetter remained England wicket-keeper for the T20I and ODI matches against India late in the season. In the T20I, Jos Buttler , his fellow Somerset wicket-keeper, made his debut, albeit as a specialist batsman; Jonny Bairstow , the Yorkshire wicket-keeper, made his debut in the final ODI in a similar role. [50] In that series, Kieswetter struggled against the moving ball in English conditions; he was praised, however, for his attacking batting, including 46 runs from 25 balls in the second match. Based on the number of appearances that he made for England, Kieswetter was awarded an incremental contract by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in September 2011. [b] [52] During England's subsequent 5–0 ODI series loss in India, described by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ‍ '​s Stephen Brenkley as "a tour too far for England", [53] Kieswetter was the only England batsman to maintain a strike rate above 100. He scored one half-century during the tour, [54] and was included in the England Lions squad that toured Sri Lanka three months later. [55]
End of international career[ edit ]
Playing for the Lions, Kieswetter moved into the middle-order, rather than opening the batting; this was intended to prepare him for a similar switch with the senior England team to allow Kevin Pietersen to open. [56] He scored a century and a half-century to help England win the series 3–2, though he was outperformed by Buttler. [57] In early 2012, playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, Kieswetter only batted twice in the ODI series, and was praised for his 43-run contribution in the fourth match, though George Dobell of ESPNcricinfo identified his wicket-keeping as "still not as polished as he would like". [58] Although Kieswetter dropped down the order in ODIs, he retained his place opening the batting in T20Is. In contrast to the 2010 World Twenty20, when the England players were told to attack bat selflessly, [59] in 2012 the team was instructed to avoid losing early wickets, and Kieswetter struggled to adapt his game to score low-risk singles and rotate the strike. [60] During the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 , he lost his place in England's T20I team after a match against New Zealand in which he scored four runs from fourteen balls. [60] That was the final international Twenty20 match of his career. In his 25 matches, he scored 526 runs at an average of 21.91 and a strike rate of 111.91. [1] Despite his struggles in international cricket, Kieswetter had a successful season with Somerset; he scored 848 first-class runs at an average of just over 60, including a century against Warwickshire and one for the Lions against Australia A. [61] [62]
The following year, Kieswetter retained his place in the ODI team for the tour of India, although ESPNcricinfo‍ '​s Alex Winter suggested that it might be due to "England's desire to protect the workload of their players ahead of back-to-back Ashes series ." [63] Winter's colleague, Dobell, described the England ODI wicket-keeper position as one of England's key areas requiring resolution, citing both Bairstow and Buttler as candidates to take over, as well as the possibility of Matt Prior, the England Test wicket-keeper, reclaiming the role. [64] Kieswetter played the first three ODIs of the series, scoring 24 not out, 18 and 0 before he was dropped [65] and replaced by Buttler. Dobell described Kieswetter as "perhaps... a little unfortunate", but cited his inability to adjust his game and the number of balls he blocked as the reasons for his removal. [66] He played 46 ODIs, scoring 1,054 runs at an average of 30.11. [1]
Later domestic career[ edit ]
The competition between Kieswetter and Buttler for England's one-day wicket-keeping role also caused conflict at Somerset for the 2013 season: both players wanted to fulfil the role for the county. Kieswetter began the season as the wicket-keeper in the County Championship, [67] but broke his thumb during the third match of the season, [68] which kept him out of action for six weeks. [69] Kieswetter had a particularly strong Twenty20 season, finishing as the leading run-scorer in the 2013 Friends Life t20 with 517 runs, including five half-centuries. [70] He scored a late-season century against Warwickshire in the County Championship, but in a season in which Somerset struggled against relegation, [71] he scored a relatively modest 606 first-class runs at an average of 31.89. [10] At the end of the season, Buttler, whose contract with Somerset had expired, announced that he was joining Lancashire , leaving Kieswetter as the clear first-choice wicket-keeper at Somerset. [72]
Kieswetter signed with the Brisbane Heat for the 2013–14 Big Bash League , [73] During the tournament, he scored 192 runs from eight matches including two half-centuries. [19] He entered the 2014 Indian Premier League auction , but remained unsold, to the relief of the director of cricket at Somerset, David Nosworthy . [74] He was called up as a late replacement for the injured Luke Wright for England's squad in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 , but was not selected to play. [75] He began the 2014 season positively for Somerset, particularly in the Twenty20 competition, in which he scored six half-centuries in ten innings, averaging just under 50. [19]
Injury and retirement[ edit ]
A selfie posted by Kieswetter the day after being injured.
On 12 July 2014, Kieswetter suffered a broken nose and fractured cheek bone while batting for Somerset against Northamptonshire in a County Championship match. The bowler, David Willey , delivered a short-pitched bouncer which went through the gap between the grille and the visor on Kieswetter's helmet and struck him in the face. The injuries were initially described by Somerset's chairman, Andy Nash, as "serious but non-career threatening". [76] He underwent facial surgery, and suffered from double vision for a while after. He returned to the Somerset side before the end of the 2014 season and scored a half-century in his first match back, against Middlesex , though he admitted that his vision was still not fully recovered. [77] Kieswetter signed for the South African franchise Warriors as their overseas player to play in the Ram Slam T20 Challenge for the 2014–15 season. [78] He played all ten matches for the Warriors, scoring 199 runs at an average of 22.11, including two half-centuries.
On 10 December 2014, despite having been named in England's 30-man provisional 2015 Cricket World Cup squad, Kieswetter revealed that he was still suffering vision problems. He announced that he would not play in the 2015 season and would seek further treatment. [79] The following June, he announced his retirement from professional cricket, saying that, although he was still capable of playing, he could not play to the standard he wanted; "In the end I just thought, there are too many mediocre players in county cricket – and good luck to them – but I don't want to be another one." [80] He finished his career with similar statistics in first-class and List A cricket; in both he averaged just under 40 and had scored eleven centuries. In Twenty20 cricket, his highest score was 89 not out, and he averaged just over 30. [1] In an interview with ESPNcricinfo shortly after his retirement, Kieswetter said that he would be interested in working in the media, perhaps as part of a commentary team for Twenty20 matches. [80]
Playing style[ edit ]
Kieswetter's confident and attacking batting style was compared to that of Kevin Pietersen , another England batsman of South African origin. [15] Although Kieswetter favoured the off-side, [81] he was also strong behind square on both sides, and stood with a typical South African stance, his bat held high. [4] He was generally more highly regarded for his batting than his wicket-keeping, often drawing criticism for the quality of his glovework. [82] [83] For a couple of matches during 2012, he was used an off spin bowler by Somerset, collecting three wickets. [84]
Somerset experimented with Kieswetter throughout the order, trying to find the most effective place for him. He began as a middle-order batsman, but by the end of the 2007 season, although he remained in the middle-order in first-class cricket, Kieswetter regularly found himself opening the batting alongside Marcus Trescothick in one-day cricket, a role he would also take up in opening six matches of the 2009 Twenty20 Cup , although he later dropped back into the middle order to improve the balance of the side. [85] On his international call-up, England chose to utilise Kieswetter as an opening batsman. He was selected "because of his proven ability to pierce the field in the Powerplay overs , particularly with his booming drives up and over the covers." [38] He later moved down the order for England to accommodate Kevin Pietersen as opener. [56]
Notes[ edit ]
^ "801 for 8" is cricket notation which could also be written 801/8, and signifies that the batting team has scored 801 runs, and has lost eight of its ten wickets. See Scoring (cricket) for more information.
^ The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) award three types of contracts to international players: a central contract means that the ECB pay the player's wage, an incremental contract means that the player's county side pay the player's wage, with the ECB paying additional salary, and a tour contract means that the player is paid by appearance or tour. [51]



An example of a scorecard
There are predominantly two methods that scorers use to record a game: manually and computerized.
The manual method uses a scorecard and a pen. The scorecard is colloquially known as The Book. Using the book, the scorer fills out two main sections per ball, the bowling analysis and the batting analysis. Each section helps track the number of balls bowled in an over, any extras (such as Wide Balls and No Balls) and also any wickets (or dismissals). At the end of each over, the scorer may fill out an over analysis with the score at the end of the over, the number of wickets that have fallen, any penalties incurred and the number of the bowler in the analysis.
Chauka scoring app showing the cricket scoring screen
Most software used for cricket scoring uses a form at the front end with buttons for the scorer to press to record ball by ball events. Additional functions include being able to draw a line denoting where the ball went from the batting crease and where the ball pitched. This gives additional charts tracking bowling placement and shot selection which can then be used at the coaching level. This additional information, however, does not form part of the critical role of a scorer, which is to keep track of the score of the game. It has been known for scorers to use both methods in conjunction with one another, in case the computer goes down or runs out of battery.
Addition to computer software, mobile applications are being used lately. Most of the amateur tournaments use mobile apps on their smartphones because they are more convenient and free, which makes it perfect fit for amateur cricketers since they cannot afford to spend money on standalone and custom software. One of the widely used cricket scoring app is Chauka . Mobile apps let's amateur cricketers to have a chance to keep their scores online and also provides them personalized statistics with graphs on their own mobile devices.
Referring to scores[ edit ]
The scoreboard at the Adelaide Oval .
The score of a cricket team whose innings is in progress is given as the number of runs they have scored "for" the number of wickets their opponents have taken. For example, a team that has scored 100 runs and lost three wickets has a score of "a hundred for three", written 100–3 (also 100/3); The exception to this is in Australia, where it is conventional to reverse the wickets and runs scored, so that what would be written 100–3 elsewhere in the world is written and said 3–100 (or 3/100) in Australia. A team that is dismissed having scored 300 runs is said to have a score of "three hundred all out", rather than "three hundred for ten"; the score for the innings is then simply written 300. However, if a team declare their innings closed (in a First-class match) or reach an over limit (in a limited-overs match), the number of wickets is included in their score for the innings, for example 275–7. A declaration is noted by appending a "d" or "dec" to the score (for example 300–8d); such a score is spoken in the standard form with the word "declared" appended (example: "300 for 8 declared").
In a two innings match, the scores of each team for their two innings are always given separately. An exampted items need to go somewhere else.

Removing Speedy at Wandoor Siva Temple [ edit ]
Hi Whitetararaj, you recently removed a deletion tag from Wandoor Siva Temple . Because Wikipedia policy does not allow the creator of the page to remove speedy deletion tags, an automated program has replaced the tag. Although the deletion proposal may be incorrect, removing the tag is not the correct way for you to contest the deletion, even if you are more experienced than the nominator. Instead, please use the talk page to explain why the page should not be deleted. Remember to be patient, there is no harm in waiting for another experienced user to review the deletion and judge what the right course of action is. As you are involved, and therefore potentially biased, you should refrain from doing this yourself. Thank you, - SDPatrolBot ( talk ) 11:57, 14 January 2013 (UTC)

Nomination of Ponnambalamedu for deletion[ edit ]
A discussion is taking place as to whether the article Ponnambalamedu is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia according to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines or whether it should be deleted .
The article will be discussed at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ponnambalamedu until a consensus is reached, and anyone is welcome to contribute to the discussion. The nomination will explain the policies and guidelines which are of concern. The discussion focuses on high-quality evidence and our policies and guidelines.
Users may edit the article during the discussion, including to improve the article to address concerns raised in the discussion. However, do not remove the article-for-deletion template from the top of the article. Pam D 09:05, 15 January 2013 (UTC)
final warning[ edit ]
This is your last warning. The next time you add unsourced material to Wikipedia, as you did at multiple articles , you will be blocked from editing without further notice.
Adding material in the way you are doing harms Wikipedia. , because it diverts the time and energy of others into dealing with the necessary sourcing. You could do it better: you must have some information in front of you when you add them, though apparently it is often only their website or a listing in a film database.
For films, this is not enough to establish notability,and unless someone goes to the trouble of finding proper information such as reviews, the articles will be removed. see WP:NOTFILM Buildings such as temples are not necessarily notable either--it depends on their significance, and the significance must be proven by sources--see WP:NGEO For secondary schools , we normally keep those for which we have reliable information of existence, but this is only a custom, not a formal guideline, and what you are doing might lead to another result for these.
On one of the article talk pages, you say your goal is to achieve 100 new articles. this is not a goal helpful to the encyclopedia; what would be helpful is to write 10, or even 1 acceptable article with reliable references for notability , references providing substantial coverage from 3rd party independent published reliable sources, print or online, but not blogs or press releases, or the subjects' web sites.

"Details to be announced after the conclusion of the Test," the ICC said on Twitter.
Ishant and Prasad faced off during the final session of the fourth day when Ishant, after being bounced several times by Prasad, smacked his helmet repeatedly while running down the pitch, as if asking the bowler to aim at his head. Chandimal walked over from slip, his shoulder brushing Ishant's, and exchanged words with the batsman.
Once India's innings ended and as Ishant ran back to the dressing room to get ready to bowl, Prasad followed him at a full sprint all the way back. These two incidents were the flash points of an ill-tempered passage of play that involved several stares and words being exchanged between Ishant and Sri Lanka's players.
There was further tension when Ishant gave Upul Tharanga an angry send-off and then went on to celebrate Chandimal's dismissal by striking the side of his own head repeatedly.
Ishant had been docked 65% of his match fee at the end of the second Test for send-offs to Thirimanne and Chandimal. Thirimanne, too, was fined 30% of his match fee for showing dissent at the umpire's decision during the second Test.

Stonehenge , a Neolithic monument
The earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of Homo antecessor , dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000 years ago. [26] Modern humans are known to have inhabited the area during the Upper Paleolithic period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years. [27] [28] After the last ice age only large mammals such as mammoths , bison and woolly rhinoceros remained. Roughly 11,000 years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula . [29] The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia . [30] As the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000 years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.
The Beaker culture arrived around 2,500 BC, introducing drinking and food vessels constructed from clay, as well as vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores. [31] It was during this time that major Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made bronze , and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron smelting allowed the construction of better ploughs , advancing agriculture (for instance, with Celtic fields ), as well as the production of more effective weapons. [32]
Boudica led an uprising against the Roman Empire
During the Iron Age , Celtic culture , deriving from the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures , arrived from Central Europe. Brythonic was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to Ptolemy 's Geographia there were around 20 tribes in the area. Earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the Roman Republic attempted to invade twice in 55 BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a client king from the Trinovantes .
The Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD during the reign of Emperor Claudius , subsequently conquering much of Britain , and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as Britannia province . [33] The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the Catuvellauni led by Caratacus . Later, an uprising led by Boudica , Queen of the Iceni , ended with Boudica's suicide following her defeat at the Battle of Watling Street . [34] This era saw a Greco-Roman culture prevail with the introduction of Roman law , Roman architecture , sewage systems, many agricultural items and silk. [35] [36] [37] In the 3rd century, Emperor Septimius Severus died at Eboracum (now York ), where Constantine was subsequently proclaimed emperor. [38]
There is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, probably much earlier. According to Bede , missionaries were sent from Rome by Eleutherius at the request of the chieftain Lucius of Britain in 180 AD, to settle differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials, which were disturbing the church. There are traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through Joseph of Arimathea , while others claim through Lucius of Britain . [39] By 410, during the Decline of the Roman Empire , Britain was left exposed by the End of Roman rule in Britain and the withdrawal of Roman army units, to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars. [40] Celtic Christian monastic and missionary movements flourished: Patrick (5th-century Ireland) and in the 6th century Brendan (Clonfert), Comgall (Bangor), David (Wales), Aiden (Lindisfarne) and Columba (Iona). This period of Christianity was influenced by ancient Celtic culture in its sensibilities, polity, practices and theology. Local "congregations" were centred in the monastic community and monastic leaders were more like chieftains, as peers, rather than in the more hierarchical system of the Roman-dominated church (see Early Christian Christianity, Brendan Lehane, Constable, London: John Murray Ltd., 1968).
Middle Ages
Replica of a 7th-century ceremonial helmet from the Kingdom of East Anglia , found at Sutton Hoo
Roman military withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Angles , Saxons and Jutes who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province and began to settle, initially in the eastern part of the country. [40] Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the Battle of Mount Badon , but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brythonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a Dark Age . The nature and progression of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain is consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Roman-dominated Christianity had in general disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by Augustine from 597 onwards. [41] Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the Council of Whitby (664), which was ostensibly about haircuts and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice (Lehane).
During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria , Mercia , Wessex , East Anglia , Essex , Kent and Sussex . Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued. [42] The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence. [43] In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the Danelaw . This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under Æthelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived North Sea empire that also included Denmark and Norway . However the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042.
King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt , fought on Saint Crispin's Day and concluded with an English victory against a larger French army in the Hundred Years' War .
A dispute over the succession to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy . [44] The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. [45] This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language. [46]
Subsequently the House of Plantagenet from Anjou inherited the English throne under Henry II , adding England to the budding Angevin Empire of fiefs the family had inherited in France including Aquitaine . [47] They reigned for three centuries, some noted monarchs being Richard I , Edward I , Edward III and Henry V . [47] The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including the signing of the Magna Carta , an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign's powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen. Catholic monasticism flourished, providing philosophers, and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage. The Principality of Wales became a Plantagenet fief during the 13th century [48] and the Lordship of Ireland was given to the English monarchy by the Pope.
During the 14th century, the Plantagenets and the House of Valois both claimed to be legitimate claimants to the House of Capet and with it France; the two powers clashed in the Hundred Years' War . [49] The Black Death epidemic hit England ; starting in 1348, it eventually killed up to half of England's inhabitants . [50] [51] From 1453 to 1487 civil war occurred between two branches of the royal family—the Yorkists and Lancastrians —known as the Wars of the Roses . [52] Eventually it led to the Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the Tudors , a branch of the Lancastrians headed by Henry Tudor who invaded with Welsh and Breton mercenaries, gaining victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field where the Yorkist king Richard III was killed. [53]
Early Modern
King Henry VIII became Supreme Head of the Church of England
During the Tudor period , the Renaissance reached England through Italian courtiers, who reintroduced artistic, educational and scholarly debate from classical antiquity. [54] England began to develop naval skills , and exploration to the West intensified. [55] [56]
Henry VIII broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England . In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the roots of the split were more political than theological. [nb 2] He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts . There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I . The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism .
Competing with Spain , the first English colony in the Americas was founded in 1585 by explorer Walter Raleigh in Virginia and named Roanoke . The Roanoke colony failed and is known as the lost colony, after it was found abandoned on the return of the late-arriving supply ship. [58] With the East India Company , England also competed with the Dutch and French in the East. In 1588, during the Elizabethan period , an English fleet under Francis Drake defeated an invading Spanish Armada . The political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the King of Scots , James VI , a kingdom which was a longtime rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as James I — creating a personal union . [59] [60] He styled himself King of Great Britain , although this had no basis in English law. [61] Under the auspices of King James VI and I the Authorised King James Version of the Holy Bible was published in 1611. It has not only been ranked with Shakespeare 's works as the greatest masterpiece of literature in the English language but also was the standard version of the Bible read by most Protestant Christians for four hundred years, until modern revisions were produced in the 20th century.
The English Restoration restored the monarchy under King Charles II and peace after the English Civil War .
Based on conflicting political, religious and social positions, the English Civil War was fought between the supporters of Parliament and those of King Charles I , known colloquially as Roundheads and Cavaliers respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted Wars of the Three Kingdoms , involving Scotland and Ireland . The Parliamentarians were victorious, Charles I was executed and the kingdom replaced by the Commonwealth . Leader of the Parliament forces, Oliver Cromwell declared himself Lord Protector in 1653; a period of personal rule followed. [62] After Cromwell's death and the resignation of his son Richard as Lord Protector, Charles II was invited to return as monarch in 1660, in a move called the Restoration . After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, it was constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together, though Parliament would have the real power. This was established with the Bill of Rights in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament and could not be suspended by the King, also that the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without the prior approval of Parliament. [63] Also since that time, no British monarch has entered the House of Commons when it is sitting, which is annually commemorated at the State Opening of Parliament by the British monarch when the doors of the House of Commons are slammed in the face of the monarch's messenger, symbolising the rights of Parliament and its independence from the monarch. [64] [65] With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged.
In 1666 the Great Fire of London gutted the City of London but it was rebuilt shortly afterwards [66] with many significant buildings designed by Sir Christopher Wren . In Parliament two factions had emerged — the Tories and Whigs . Though the Tories initially supported Catholic king James II , some of them, along with the Whigs, deposed him in the Revolution of 1688 and invited Dutch prince William of Orange to become William III . Some English people, especially in the north, were Jacobites and continued to support James and his sons. After the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed, [67] the two countries joined in political union , to create the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. [59] To accommodate the union, institutions such as the law and national churches of each remained separate. [68]
Late Modern and contemporary
Saltaire , West Yorkshire, is a model mill town from the Industrial Revolution , and a World Heritage Site .
Under the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English initiatives combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in British overseas trade protected by the Royal Navy paved the way for the establishment of the British Empire . Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution , a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development. [69] The opening of Northwest England's Bridgewater Canal in 1761 ushered in the canal age in Britain . [70] [71] In 1825 the world's first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway—the Stockton and Darlington Railway —opened to the public. [70]
Cotton mills in Manchester , the world's "first industrial city", circa 1820. [72]
During the Industrial Revolution, many workers moved from England's countryside to new and expanding urban industrial areas to work in factories, for instance at Manchester and Birmingham , dubbed "Warehouse City" and "Workshop of the World" respectively. [73] [74] England maintained relative stability throughout the French Revolution ; William Pitt the Younger was British Prime Minister for the reign of George III . During the Napoleonic Wars , Napoleon planned to invade from the south-east . However this failed to manifest and the Napoleonic forces were defeated by the British at sea by Lord Nelson and on land by the Duke of Wellington . The Napoleonic Wars fostered a concept of Britishness and a united national British people , shared with the Scots and Welsh. [75]
The Cenotaph, Whitehall , is a memorial to members of the British Armed Forces who died during the two World Wars.
London became the largest and most populous metropolitan area in the world during the Victorian era , and trade within the British Empire—as well as the standing of the British military and navy—was prestigious. [76] Political agitation at home from radicals such as the Chartists and the suffragettes enabled legislative reform and universal suffrage . [77] Power shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the Allies . [nb 3] Two decades later, in World War II , the United Kingdom was again one of the Allies . At the end of the Phoney War , Winston Churchill became the wartime Prime Minister. Developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by air-raids during the Blitz . Following the war, the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation , and there was a speeding up of technological innovations; automobiles became the primary means of transport and Frank Whittle 's development of the jet engine led to wider air travel . [79] Residential patterns were altered in England by private motoring, and by the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. The UK's NHS provided publicly funded health care to all UK permanent residents free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. Combined, these changes prompted the reform of local government in England in the mid-20th century. [80] [81]
Since the 20th century there has been significant population movement to England, mostly from other parts of the British Isles , but also from the Commonwealth , particularly the Indian subcontinent . [82] Since the 1970s there has been a large move away from manufacturing and an increasing emphasis on the service industry . [83] As part of the United Kingdom, the area joined a common market initiative called the European Economic Community which became the European Union . Since the late 20th century the administration of the United Kingdom has moved towards devolved governance in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. [84] England and Wales continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the United Kingdom. [85] Devolution has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more English-specific identity and patriotism. [86] [87] There is no devolved English government, but an attempt to create a similar system on a sub-regional basis was rejected by referendum. [88]

Tactical considerations[ edit ]
The variations in different types of delivery, as well as variations caused by directing the ball with differing line and length , are major weapons in a bowler's arsenal. Throughout an over, the bowler will choose a sequence of deliveries designed to attack the batsman's concentration and technique, in an effort to get him out .
The bowler also varies the amount of loop and pace imparted to various deliveries to try to cause the batsman to misjudge and make a mistake. As the crease has a width, the bowler can change the angle from which he delivers to the batsman in an attempt to induce a misjudgement.
Usually, the bowler decides what type of delivery to bowl next, without consultation or even informing any other member of his team. Sometimes, the team captain will offer advice or even issue a direct order regarding what deliveries to bowl, based on his observations of the batsman and the strategic state of the game. Another player who occasionally offers advice to the bowler is the wicket-keeper , since he has a unique view of the batsman and may be able to spot weaknesses of technique.
Another piece of information important for the bowlers to consider prior to their deliveries is the state of pitch. The pitch is a natural ground and its state is subjected to variation over the course of the cricket, some of which are multi-day events such as test matches. Spinners find an old pitch, one that hasn’t been frequently utilized, more suitable to their deliveries rather than a fresh pitced a biometric smart chip identity card known as MyKad at the age of 12, and must carry the card at all times.

Population density (person per km2) in 2010.
The education system features a non-compulsory kindergarten education followed by six years of compulsory primary education, and five years of optional secondary education. [215] Schools in the primary education system are divided into two categories: national primary schools, which teach in Malay, and vernacular schools, which teach in Chinese or Tamil. [216] Secondary education is conducted for five years. In the final year of secondary education, students sit for the Malaysian Certificate of Education examination . [217] Since the introduction of the matriculation programme in 1999, students who completed the 12-month programme in matriculation colleges can enroll in local universities. However, in the matriculation system, only 10 per cent of places are open to non-bumiputera students. [218]

The infant mortality rate in 2009 was 6 deaths per 1000 births, and life expectancy at birth in 2009 was 75 years. [219] With the aim of developing Malaysia into a medical tourism destination, 5 per cent of the government social sector development budget is spent on health care . [220] The population in concentrated on Peninsular Malaysia [221] where 20 million of approximately 28 million Malaysians live. [7] 70 per cent of the population is urban. [6] Kuala Lumpur is the capital [6] and the largest city in Malaysia, [222] as well as its main commercial and financial centre. [223] Putrajaya , a purpose-built city constructed from 1999, is the seat of government, [224] as many executive and judicial branches of the federal government were moved there to ease growing congestion within Kuala Lumpur. [225] Due to the rise in labour-intensive industries, [226] the country is estimated to have over 3 million migrant workers; about 10 per cent of the population. [227] Sabah-based NGOs estimate that out of the 3 million that make up the population of Sabah, 2 million are illegal immigrants. [228] Malaysia hosts a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 171,500. Of this population, approximately 79,000 are from Burma, 72,400 from the Philippines, and 17,700 from Indonesia. Malaysian officials are reported to have turned deportees directly over to human smugglers in 2007, and Malaysia employs RELA , a volunteer militia with a history of controversies, to enforce its immigration law.

Rules[ edit ]
In the main the Laws of cricket apply. However, in ODIs, each team gets to bat only a fixed number of overs . In Very Special Laxman. His 107 (104) against Pakistan in the fifth and the final ODI at Lahore , helped India win by 40 runs and clinch the series 3–2.
Decline of form (2004–2005)[ edit ]
However, Laxman's form was on the decline since the series against Australia. Beginning with the series in Pakistan in 2004, Laxman had only[ clarification needed ] Test centuries to his credit, with one coming against a weak Zimbabwe side. He averaged just 31 in the Test series in Pakistan in 3 matches. His only half-century (71) came in a high-scoring game at Rawalpindi where India made a mammoth 600 to win the game by an innings and 131 runs. He struggled to score in the ODI series in England which put question marks over his future in the shorter format. He struggled against his favourite opponents Australia in the home series in October–November 2004, although his 69 in the low-scoring final Test at Mumbai was instrumental for India to record a consolation victory. He had a mixed Test series against Pakistan in 2005. He scored 58 in the first Test, 0 and 24 in the second and 79* and 5 in the third. He batted well in the Sri Lanka Test series scoring a fifty at Delhi and a crucial century (104) in the last match at Ahmedabad . Laxman was dropped after scoring a duck in the first Test against England at Nagpur in March 2006. He regained his place for the tour of the West Indies in place of the injured Tendulkar, and made a hundred in the third Test. He also scored a resilient 63 in the second innings to deny West Indies the victory in the same match. In ODIs, Laxman was left out persistently since Greg Chappell took over as coach in mid-2005, mainly on account of his slow ground fielding and running between the wickets; Laxman is a highly regarded close-catching fielder in stationary positions but in ODIs, these positions are generally disused except for the opening phases of the match, and players otherwise have to patrol substantial spaces and retrieve balls. Another reason was a perception that his batting is too one paced for ODI cricket and that he lacks the ability to score at a high rate as required when the batting team has the momentum, or in the closing stages of the innings. This was despite his superb form in Australia and Pakistan in early 2004, when he made four centuries in 14 games, including three in a week in the VB Series in Australia.
Return to form[ edit ]
VVS Laxman
In December 2005, Laxman helped India to victory against Sri Lanka with a fine century. In June 2006, Laxman again rescued India from a difficult position against the West Indies with a gritty century. In November 2006, he was selected in the test squad for India's tour of South Africa. In the first test in Johannesburg Laxman scored 73 in the second innings to help India claim a historic 123 run win. In the 2007 tour of England Laxman produced three good innings, two of which were half-centuries and a vital 39 that helped India draw the first test at Lords. He passed the 5000 run landmark in the first day of the final test.
After the tests he joined Lancashire as their overseas player in place of Brad Hodge . He played in five games of the county championship and showed glimpses of his sublime batting. In their final County Championship game of 2007, against Surrey at the Oval, Laxman scored a century in the second innings which Lancashire were chasing 489 to win. They just missed out by 25 runs and subsequently lost the Championship to Sussex. His performance for Lancashire was good with 380 runs scored in 5 matches at an average of 54.28 with 2 centuries and 2 half-centuries [57]
In India's home series against Pakistan in 2007, V.V.S. Laxman once again showed his importance to the team with a disciplined batting performance in the 1st Test at Delhi , as he scored 72* in dire circumstances. [58] He then followed that innings of 72 in the first test with 112 in the second test. [59] This ensured his place on the tour of Australia which would be his third to that country.
Sublime form from end of 2007 till May 2011[ edit ]
Laxman's good form continued in the 2007/08 Test series against Australia with him scoring 109 against Australia on the second day of the controversial Sydney Test to put India back into the contest. It was his 12th hundred in Test matches, and his 5th against Australia. It was also his third consecutive century at SCG , giving him an average well above 90 at the venue. He followed this up with a gritty knock of 79 in Perth , assisted by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and RP Singh , which set India up to record a historic and unexpected victory at a ground on which previously no Asian team had won. He hit 51 in the first innings of the final Test at Adelaide. He finished as the second highest run-getter for India in that series, only behind Sachin Tendulkar .
He, like all other Indian batsmen, struggled in Sri Lanka against the spin duo of Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis later in July–August that year. India lost the first Test by an innings and 239 runs at Colombo , where Laxman's first innings score of 50 was the only half-century scored by an Indian batsman in either innings. Laxman scored another fifty in that series, in the third Test, an unbeaten 61 as India went on to lose the game by 8 wickets and the series 2–1. Laxman was dismissed by Mendis on all five occasions in that series. He also crossed the 6000-run milestone during the series.
Laxman was supposed to replace Adam Voges for Nottinghamshire , but this move was vetoed by the BCCI due to the fact that there are players from the rival Indian Cricket League playing for Nottinghamshire.
Against Australia, in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy later that year, Laxman was in top form as he scored 381 runs from 4 Tests with a double-hundred and two fifties. During the third Test at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi, Laxman scored an unbeaten 200 in the first innings with characteristic use of his wrists and flicks through the leg side. In the same innings, Gautam Gambhir scored 206, Laxman and Gambhir becoming the first pair of batsmen to score double-centuries in the same innings for India, and the first to do so against Australia. This was his second double-century in Test cricket with the previous one coming against the same opponents. [60] He made an unbeaten 59 in the second innings and was named Man of the Match. The match was also the last game of India's spin wizard Anil Kumble who was also the captain of the team. In the final Test at Nagpur , Laxman scored another half-century in the first innings of the match.

Don't think I need ankle surgery - Ishant

Ishant Sharma has said his ankle is fine © AFP
Ishant Sharma , the India fast bowler, has said that his ankle has healed and that he, in all probability, no longer needs surgery to fix it. Ishant, who played the first Test against the West Indies in Delhi, had sustained a ligament injury to his left ankle during the third Test against England at Edgbaston earlier this year. He was forced to miss the limited-overs part of the England tour and the subsequent one-day series against the same opponents in India, but recovered in time to play against West Indies.
"There is no risk about it [ankle]," Ishant told reporters after India's practice session on Sunday. I've been working a lot on my ankle and everything. I am fit now and I am ready to play in Australia, and I don't think even after the Australia tour I will need surgery."
Zaheer Khan , India's leading fast bowler, has been out of action since the first Test in England back in June. With offspinner Harbhajan Singh also missing, having been dropped for the first two Tests against West Indies, Ishant has been catapulted into the role of India's senior strike-bower, a role he said he was happy to fill.
"Obviously it's a great feeling ... It's an honour to lead the Indian attack. Being the senior-most bowler in the team, it's really great. It's difficult to express this kind of feeling actually. You are obviously going to miss a bowler like Zak [Zaheer]. But injuries are part and h, one that hasn’t come under use as much such as a pitch at the start of the match.
The batsman’s anticipation of the delivery[ edit ]
While a bowler, with the use of variations in his/her delivery aims to target the concentration of batsmen as well as their skill and technique of batting, anticipation of the delivery is crucial for the batsman, as emphasized by Jodi Richardson. [1] Richardson reveals the world class batsman’s dilemma while facing fast bowlers, stating that the time between the batsmen’s anticipation of the trajectory of the ball and positioning themselves for the appropriate shot can be twice as long as the interval between the bowl leaving the bowler’s hand and reaching the batsman’s crease. Side by side, Richardson alludes to the research undertaken by Dr. Sean Müller in Australia which was partly funded by Cricket Australia 's Centre of Excellence . The results of the research demonstrated the importance of anticipation of the delivery for batsmen in cricket. They revealed that experienced batsmen possessed a unique ability which enabled them to adjust their feet as well as their positioning on the crease accordingly based upon their reading of the body language and movements enacted by the bowler prior to the release of the ball. This foresight that batsmen utilize while on the crease is referred to as ‘advance information’ by Richardson. Moreover, Müller’s research outlined that the presence of this ‘advance information’ was not as evident among the lesser skilled batsmen in comparison to the experienced ones.
Controversies and debate involving deliveries[ edit ]
Main article: Underarm bowling incident of 1981
Underarm or lob bowling was the original cricket delivery style, but had largely died out before the 20th century, although it was used until 1910 by George Simpson-Hayward , and remained a legal delivery type. On 1 February 1981, when Australia was playing New Zealand in a One Day International cricket match, and New Zealand needed six runs to tie the match from the final ball. Greg Chappell , the Australian captain, ordered the bowler (his brother Trevor ) to bowl underarm , rolling the ball along the ground to prevent the Number 10 New Zealand batsman ( Brian McKechnie ) any chance of hitting a six from the last ball to tie the match.
After the game, the then Prime Minister of New Zealand , Rob Muldoon , described it as "the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket." [2] At the time, underarm deliveries were legal, but as a direct result of the incident, underarm bowling was banned in limited overs cricket by the International Cricket Council as "not within the spirit of the game." The 2000 Code of the Laws of Cricket declares that an underarm delivery is illegal unless otherwise agreed before the match. [3]
Suspect bowling actions[ edit ]
See also: List of cricketers called for throwing in major cricket matches in Australia
A recently retired cricketer who was greatly embroiled in controversy and under scrutiny from critics over his method of executing deliveries was the Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan . Michael Selvey describes the accusations placed on the bowler in relation to his widely disputed bowling action and delivery, stating the Australian prime minister’s reference to the Sri Lankan as a ‘chucker.’ The controversy linked to Muralitharan’s delivery emerged in 1995, when the umpire of the test match between Sri Lanka and Australia deemed Muralitharan’s delivery as illegal on the suspicion that he was throwing the ball. Selvey acknowledges this as the factor sparking an ‘international cricket incident,’ with critics and some extremists going as far as insisting on the exclusion of all of the Sri Lankan’s accomplishments throughout his career from the records of cricket. However, Suresh Menon takes an adamant stance on the topic of the controversy surrounding the spinner by displaying appreciation for Muralitharan’s actions. Menon suggests that investigation into Muralitharan’s deliveries led to the revelation of imperfections present in the bowling action and deliveries of the previously considered ‘picture-perfect’ fast bowler, Glenn McGrath . This was made possible with the usage of technology and its replacement of the earlier system, which Menon refers to as ‘the naked eye.’ Eventually, it was declared legal for the bowlers to bend their arm fifteen degrees for deliveries in cricket.
Comparison to baseball[ edit ]
A delivery or ball in cricket is analogous to a pitch in baseball . The word ball in cricket usage does not imply anything about the accuracy of the delivery, unlike baseball's usage of ball to indicate a pitch outside the strike zone . The cricket equivalent of a baseball ball is a wide or a no ball .

The Media Centre was commissioned in time for the 1999 Cricket World Cup and was the first all aluminium, semi-monocoque building in the world. It was built and fitted-out in two boatyards and uses boat-building technology. The centre stands 15 metres (49 ft) above the ground and its sole support comes from the structure around its two lift shafts— it is approximately the same height as the Pavilion directly opposite it on the other side of the ground. The lower tier of the centre provides accommodation for over 100 journalists and the top tier has radio and television commentary boxes. The centre’s only opening window is in the broadcasting box used by BBC Test Match Special . [11] The building was awarded the RIBA Stirling Prize for architecture in 1999.
Tavern Stand[ edit ]
This memorial stone to Lord Harris is in the Harris Garden at Lord's
The Lord's Taverners , a charitable group comprising cricketers and cricket-lovers, take their name from the old Tavern pub at Lord's, where the organisation's founders used to congregate. The pub no longer exists, and the Tavern Stand now stands on its former site. However, a new pub of the same name is open in the grounds, as well as the Members Bar, in the Pavilion.
Field[ edit ]
For more details on this topic, see Lord's Slope .
The Mound Stand public area on the left and the Tavern Stand members area on the right. The famous Old Father Time weather vane and clock is also visible
One of the most distinctive and famous features of the Lord's ground is the significant slope across the field. The north-west side of the playing surface is 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 ins) higher than the south-east side. [12] This slope causes appreciable deviation in bounce of the ball on the pitch, making it easier to move the ball in to right-handed batsmen when bowling from the Pavilion End, and easier to move it away when bowling from the Nursery End. The outfield was notorious for becoming waterlogged, resulting in considerable reduction of loss of play due to rainfall, until clay soil was relaid with sand during the winter of 2002–2003.
Grace Gates[ edit ]
For more details on this topic, see Grace Gates .
One of the features of the ground is the pair of ornamental gates, named in honour of W. G. Grace . In 1923, the W. G. Grace Memorial Gates were erected at the St John's Wood Road entrance to the ground. [13] They were designed by Sir Herbert Baker and the opening ceremony was performed by Sir Stanley Jackson , who had suggested the inclusion of the words The Great Cricketer in the dedication. [14]
Floodlights[ edit ]
Twenty20 match at Lord's: Middlesex vs Kent, 27 May 2009
Temporary floodlights were installed at the ground in 2007 but were removed in 2008 after complaints of light pollution from residents of St. John's Wood. In January 2009, the Westminster Council approved use of new retractable [15] floodlights designed to minimize light spillage into nearby homes. Conditions of the approval included a five-year trial period during which up to 12 matches and 4 practice matches could be played under the lights from April to September. The lights must be dimmed to half-strength at 9.50 pm and be switched off by 11 pm. The floodlights were first used successfully on 27 May 2009 during the Twenty20 Cup match between Middlesex and Ken the early days of ODI cricket, the number of overs was generally 60 overs per side, and matches were also played with 40, 45 or 55 overs per side, but now it has been uniformly fixed at 50 overs.
Simply stated, the game works as follows: [2]
An ODI is contested by 2 teams of 11 players each.
The Captain of the side winning the toss chooses to either bat or bowl (field) first.
The team batting first sets the target score in a single innings . The innings lasts until the batting side is "all out" (i.e., 10 of the 11 batting players are "out") or all of the first side's allotted overs are completed.
Each bowler is restricted to bowling a maximum of 10 overs (fewer in the case of rain-reduced matches and in any event generally no more than one fifth or 20% of the total overs per innings). Therefore, each team must comprise at least five competent bowlers (either dedicated bowlers or all-rounders).
The team batting second tries to score more than the target score in order to win the match. Similarly, the side bowling second tries to bowl out the second team or make them exhaust their overs before they reach the target score in order to win.
If the number of runs scored by both teams is equal when the second team loses all of its wickets or exhausts all its overs, then the game is declared a tie (regardless of the number of wickets lost by either team).
Where a number of overs are lost, for example due to inclement weather conditions, then the total number of overs may be reduced. In the early days of ODI cricket, the team with the better run rate won, but this favoured the second team. [3] For the 1992 World Cup, an alternate method was used of simply omitting the first team's worst overs, but that favoured the first team. [3] [4] Since the late 1990s, the target or result is usually determined by the Duckworth-Lewis method . [3] Where insufficient overs are played to apply the Duckworth-Lewis method, a match is declared no result. Important one-day matches, particularly in the latter stages of major tournaments, may have two days set aside, such that a result can be achieved on the "reserve day" if the first day is washed out – either by playing a new game, or by resuming the match which was rain-interrupted.
Because the game uses a white ball instead of the red one used in First-class cricket , the ball can become discoloured and hard to see as the innings progresses, so the ICC has used various rules to help keep the ball playable. Most recently, ICC has made the use of two new balls (one from each end), the same strategy that was used in the 1992 and 1996 World Cups so that each ball is used for only 25 overs. [5] Previously, in October 2007, the ICC sanctioned that after the 34th over, the ball would be replaced with a cleaned previously-used ball. [6] Before October 2007 (except 1992 and 1996 World Cups), only one ball would be used during an innings of an ODI and it was up to the umpire to decide whether to change the ball. [2]
Fielding restrictions and powerplays[ edit ]
Main article: Powerplay (cricket)
A limited number of fielders are allowed in outfield during powerplays.
The bowling side is subjected to fielding restrictions during an ODI, in order to prevent teams from setting wholly defensive fields. Fielding restrictions dictate the maximum number of fieldsmen allowed to be outside the thirty-yard circle.
Under current ODI rules, there are three levels of fielding restrictions:
In the first 10 overs of an innings (the mandatory powerplay ), the fielding team may have at most two fielders outside the 30-yard circle. [7]
Between 11 to 40 overs four fielders will be allowed outside to field the 30-yard circle. [8]
In final 10 overs five fielders will be allowed to field outside the 30-yard circle. [9] [10]
Where a match is shortened by rain, the duration of the powerplays is adjusted to equal 30% of the team's overs wherever possible (20% for the first powerplay, 10% for the second).
History[ edit ]
Fielding restrictions were first introduced in the Australian 1980-81 season. [11] By 1992, only two fieldsmen were allowed outside the circle in the first fifteen overs, then five fieldsmen allowed outside the circle for the remaining overs. [12] This was shortened to ten overs in 2005, and two five-over powerplays were introduced, with the bowling team having discretion over the timing for both. In 2008, the batting team was given discretion for the timing of one of the two powerplays. In 2011, the teams were restricted to completing the discretionary powerplays between the 16th and 40th overs; previously, the powerplays could take place at any time between the 11th and 50th overs. Finally, in 2012, the bowling powerplay was abandoned, and the number of fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle during non-powerplay overs was reduced from five to four. [2] [13]
Trial regulations[ edit ]
The trial regulations also introduced a substitution rule that allowed the introduction of a replacement player at any stage in the match and until he was called up to play he assumed the role of 12th man. Teams nominated their replacement player, called a Supersub, before the toss. The Supersub could bat, bowl, field or keep wicket once a player was replaced; the replaced player took over the role of 12th man. Over the six months it was in operation, it became very clear that the Supersub was of far more benefit to the side that won the toss, unbalancing the game. Several international captains reached "gentleman's agreements" to discontinue this rule late in 2005. They continued to name Supersubs, as required, but they did not field them by simply using them as a normal 12th man. On 15 February 2006, the ICC announced their intention to discontinue the Supersub rule on 21 March 2006. [14]
Teams with ODI status[ edit ]
The International Cricket Council (ICC) determines which teams have ODI status (meaning that any match played between two such teams under standard one-day rules is classified as an ODI).
The ten Test-playing nations (which are also the ten full members of the ICC) have permanent ODI status. The nations are listed below with the date of each nation's ODI debut after gaining full ODI status shown in brackets (Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, and Bangladesh were ICC associate members at the times of their ODI debuts):

History[ edit ]
CricInfo was launched on 15 March 1993 by Dr Simon King, a British researcher at the University of Minnesota with help from students and researchers o part of his bat or person is grounded behind the popping crease and his wicket is fairly put down by the opposing side.
A batsman may be dismissed Run out whether or not a run is being attempted, even if the delivery is a no ball (i.e. not a fair delivery). There are a number of exceptions to this:
A batsman is not run out if he or his bat had been grounded behind the popping crease, but he subsequently leaves it to avoid injury, when the wicket is put down.
A batsman is not run out if the ball has not been touched by a fielder (excluding a helmet worn by a fielder), after the bowler has entered his delivery stride, before the wicket is put down. (Therefore, the bowler may not run out the striker instead of bowling to him. This also means that the non-striker is not out if a ball hit by the striker puts down the non-striker's wicket, provided the ball did not touch any member of the fielding side before doing so.)
A batsman is not given out Run out if he can be given out Stumped .
If the bails have been removed from the stumps, a batsman is only out if the fielder pulls a stump out of the ground with the hand holding the ball. If one bail is still on the stumps the fielder is allowed to knock the bail off to claim a run out.
The batsman can be judged run out when he is closest to the end where the wicket has been put down by the opposition and no other batsman is available inside the crease of the same end. The runs completed before a Run out are still scored by the batsman and his team (compare caught where the reverse is true). The bowler does not get credit for the wicket.
Running out a batsman "backing up"[ edit ]
As a bowler enters his delivery stride, the non-striking batsman usually 'backs up'. This means he leaves his popping crease and walks towards the other end of the wicket so that it will take him less time to reach the other end if he and his batting partner choose to attempt a run.
Sometimes a batsman, whilst backing up, leaves the popping crease before the bowler has actually delivered the ball. Where this has happened, the bowler may attempt to run the non-striking batsman out. Getting a batsman out this way, though legal, is generally considered to be against the spirit of the game as the non-striker usually accidentally leaves the crease. By convention, the bowler is meant to warn the batsman to stay in his crease rather than to take his wicket. If he fails, and the batsman gets home, the delivery is called a dead ball. When it has happened in first-class cricket , it has been controversial. [1]
Vinoo Mankad[ edit ]
The most famous example of this method of dismissal involved the Indian bowler Vinoo Mankad . It occurred during India's tour of Australia on 13 December 1947 in the second Test at Sydney . Mankad ran out Bill Brown when, in the act of delivering the ball, he held on to it and removed the bails with Brown well out of his crease. This was the second time Mankad had dismissed Brown in this fashion on the tour, having already done it in an earlier match against an Australian XI. On that occasion he had warned Brown once before running him out. The Australian press accused Mankad of being unsportsmanlike, although some Australians, including Don Bradman , the Australian captain at the time, defended Mankad's actions. Since this incident, a batsman dismissed in this fashion is (informally) said to have been "Mankaded".
The most recent incident about Mankading is England batsman Jos Buttler being dismissed by Sri Lankan bowler Sachithra Senanayake in 2014 in England . [2]
News report of Bill Brown's runout
Modern Intepretations of Run Out of Non-Striker[ edit ]
The Laws have since been changed so that a bowler may no longer "Mankad" a batsman once he has entered his delivery stride. However, under Law 42.15 it remains legal for a bowler to run out a non-striker who has strayed outside his crease after he has started his run up, but before he has entered his delivery stride. (Appendix D of the 2000 Code defines delivery stride as the stride during which the delivery swing is made; it starts when the bowler's back foot lands for that stride and ends when the front foot lands in the same stride.)
In 2011 the ICC Playing Conditions for Test Matches, [3] One Day Internationals [4] and International T20 [5] brought Mankading back into the International game and other forms of professional cricket including the IPL T20. [6]
According to the various professional playing conditions, 42.11, "The bowler is permitted, before releasing the ball and provided he has not completed his usual delivery swing, to attempt to run out the non-striker. Whether the attempt is successful or not, the ball shall not count as one of the over. If the bowler fails in an attempt to run out the non-striker, the umpire shall call and signal dead ball as soon as possible."
The umpires shall deem the bowler to have completed his delivery swing once his bowling arm passes the normal point of ball release. [7]
By making these changes, the ICC have changed the balance of regulations slightly against a batsman seeking advantage. Unless they have made these changes expecting that they will not be exercised, attempts at, and appeals for, a run out under these circumstances are within the sweep of the modern game, despite protestations by some that they are "not within the spirit of the game." The Spirit of Cricket, which is a preamble to the Laws , does not discuss this.
On 3rd Jun 2014, in the 44th over of England's innings of the 5th ODI with Sri Lanka at Edgbaston, bowler Sachithra Senanayake ran out non-striker Jos Buttler. The Umpire gave Buttler out having first asked Sri Lankan fielding captain Angelo Mathews whether he wished to confirm the appeal, [8] [9] to the dismay of the crowd and some commentators and professionals. [10] In July 2014 The World Cricket Council, an independent consultative body of former international captains and umpires, unanimously expressed support of Sri Lanka's actions and a lack of sympathy with the batsman [11]
For other forms of cricket, governed by the Laws , the bowler can run out the non-striker only before entering his delivery stride. As the bowler's back foot lands, the non-striker can move down the pitch without risk of run out.
Thus amateur cricketers may not copy the professionals in detail on this: what is Out in professional cricket (but may be regarded as too sharp a practice by some) is definitely Not Out in amateur cricket.
In some formats of indoor cricket "Mankading" is still permitted. When this happens the batsman is actually given out "Mankad" rather than "run out".[ citation needed ]

Domestic career[ edit ]
Charles played his first twenty20 match in January 2008, representing Saint Lucia in the Stanford Twenty20 . Opening the batting with Keddy Lesporis , Charles managed scores of 2 and 21 from the only matches he played in the competition. [5] Later that year he debuted for the Windward Islands in the West Indies Board Cup, the regional one-day tournament. His performances weren’t sufficient to secure a place in the team’s one-day side, and in 2009 Charles played neither List A nor twenty20 cricket. However, he made his first-class debut in January that year and played eight matches for the Windward Islands in the Regional Four Day Competition. In 16 visits to the crease he accumulated 292 runs, including a single half-century, putting him seventh in the team’s list of leading run-scorers in that year’s competition. [6]
Charles did not represent the Windward Islands in the 2009/10 Regional Four Day Competition, but in 2010 he returned to the List A side for the West Indies Board Cup, and played his first twenty20 match for the team. [7] [8] [9] In the first match of the Caribbean T20, Charles opened the batting with Devon Smith and exploited several reprieves (Charles was dropped three times and nearly run out) to score his first half-century in the format. [10]
International career[ edit ]
Having been selected in the West Indies squad for the 2012 Twenty20, Charles opened the bat with Chris Gayle in the third match (he batted after the fall of the first wicket in the West Indies opening match and in the second did not bat as the match was rained off). After building a century partnership with Gayle, Charles (who was described by ESPNCricinfo as having "little obvious pedigree as an opening batsman") went on to score 84 to help his team to victory against England. It was his highest score in first-class, List A, or even twenty20 cricket. [11] The following month Charles was dropped from the West Indies squad to face Bangladesh in a five-match ODI series. [12]

An Australian fielder runs to take a catch
New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond about to dismiss Mohammad Yousuf caught and bowled
Caught is a method of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket . Being caught out is the most common method of dismissal at higher levels of competition. This method of dismissal is covered by Law 32 of the Laws of cricket which reads: [1]
A batsman is out caught if a fielder catches the ball fully within the field of play without it bouncing once the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat. If a batsman could be given out caught or by any other method except bowled , 'caught' takes precedence.
This means that the batsman cannot be out caught if:
The ball is called a no ball or dead ball .
The batsman does not hit the ball with his bat or the gloved hand holding the bat.
The ball, having been hit, makes contact with the field before a fielder catches the ball.
The ball does not remain under the control of the fielder.
The ball is hit and lands beyond the boundary ; ( six runs ).
A fielder taking the catch makes contact with the boundary rope or the area outside the boundary.
The ball hits a close in fielder on the helmet, and rebounds in the air for a catch.
If a batsman is out caught, any runs scored off that delivery are voided. If the catch is taken by the wicket-keeper , then informally it is known as a "caught behind". A catch by the bowler is known as a "caught and bowled". This has nothing to do with the dismissal bowled but is rather a shorthand for saying the catcher and bowler are the same player (the scorecard annotation is usually c. and b. or c&b followed by the bowler's name).
If the catch taken is pronounced or obvious, the players need not appeal to the umpire; the batsman normally chooses to acknowledge the dismissal himself. However, in the event that the ball brushes the edge of the bat, or the catch is taken very close to the ground, or the ball appears to have bounced off the batsman's foot (so it has not touched the ground), or the ball appearing to come off the bat very close to the pitch surface (bump ball), or if the batsman is reluctant to accept that he has been dismissed, the fielding team has to appeal to the umpire for this decision. In international competition, if neither field umpire can clearly decide if a catch has been made or not, they may refer to the third (television) umpire for a review. The third umpire may also be used if the Umpire Decision Review System is available and a team wishes to dispute a call concerning a possible catch.
If a batsman is caught, the bowler is credited with the batsman's wicket and the catching fielder is credited for the dismissal. If the two batsmen cross each other, in attempting to take a run, before the catch was taken, the non-striking batsman at the time remains at the opposite end of the pitch as the new incoming batsman comes to the crease at his former end. This means, unless it is now a new over, he is now on strike and the incoming batsman is not.
Celebration[ edit ]
Before 2000, the Laws of Cricket defined a catch as being completed when the player had "complete control over the further disposal of the ball". In the very strictest sense, this meant that the player did not finish catching the ball until he threw it away, though the player doesn't have to throw the ball to anyone in particular in so doing.
For this reason, even today many cricketers celebrate a catch by lobbing the ball into the air. In a Super Sixes match in the 1999 Cricket World Cup , South African Herschelle Gibbs caught Australian captain Steve Waugh but Waugh was given not out when Gibbs was ruled to not have control of the ball when attempting to throw the ball in celebration. [2] Waugh went on to score a match-winning 120 not out [3] to qualify his team for the semi-finals; Australia went on to win the tournament.



2 September 2015
Early one-day seasons[ edit ]
Celebrating a century against the World XI in the second ICC Super Series match at Telstra Dome (7 October 2005).
Gilchrist was called up for the Australian One Day International (ODI) team in 1996, his debut coming against South Africa at Faridabad on 25 October 1996 as the 129th Australian ODI cap , [1] [50] [51] after an injury to incumbent Ian Healy . [31] While not particularly impressive with the bat on his debut, scoring 18 before being bowled by Allan Donald , Gilchrist took his first catch as an international wicketkeeper, Hansie Cronje departing for a golden duck from the bowling of Paul Reiffel . [51] He was run out for a duck in his only other ODI on the tour. [21] Healy resumed his place during the 1996–97 season. Gilchrist replaced Healy for the first two ODIs in the 1997 Australian tour of South Africa , after Healy was suspended for dissent. When Healy returned Gilchrist maintained his position in the team as a specialist batsman after Mark Waugh sustained a hand injury. [52] [53] It was during this series that Gilchrist made his first ODI half-century, with an innings of 77 in Durban . [54] He totalled 127 runs at 31.75 for the series. [21] Gilchrist went on to play in the Texaco Trophy later in 1997 in the 3–0 series loss against England , scoring 53 and 33 in two innings. [21] [55]
At the start of the 1997–98 Australian season, Healy and captain Mark Taylor were omitted from the ODI squad as the Australian selectors opted for Gilchrist and Michael di Venuto . Gilchrist's elevation was made possible by a change in policy by selectors, who announced that selection for ODI and Test teams would be separate, with Test and ODI specialists selected accordingly, while Healy remained the preferred Test wicket-keeper. [56] This came after Australia failed to qualify for the previous season's ODI triangular series final for the first time in 17 years. [57] The new team was initially unconvincing, losing all four round robin matches against South Africa in the 1997–98 Carlton & United Series, [58] with multiple players filling Taylor's role as Mark Waugh 's opening partner without success. [58] Gilchrist also struggled batting in the lower order at number seven, the conventional wicket-keeper's batting position, scoring 148 runs at 24.66 in the eight qualifying matches. [21] [59] In the first final against South Africa at the Melbourne Cricket Ground Gilchrist was selected as Waugh's opening partner. In a particularly poor start to the new combination, Waugh was run out after a mix-up with Gilchrist. [60] However, in the second final, Gilchrist struck his maiden ODI century, spearheading Australia's successful run chase at the Sydney Cricket Ground , [21] securing his position as an opening batsman. [61] Australia won the third final to claim the title. [62]
Touring New Zealand in February 1998, Gilchrist topped that Australia averages with 200 runs at 50.00, [63] including a match-winning 118 in the first match. [21] He also effected his first ODI stumping, the wicket of Nathan Astle in the Second ODI in Wellington . [64] Australia then played two triangular tournaments in Asia. Gilchrist struggled in India, scoring 86 runs at 17.20. [21] He went on to play in the Coca Cola Cup in Sharjah in April 1998, a triangular tournament between Australia, India and New Zealand . Australia finished runners-up in the tournament, with Gilchrist taking nine dismissals as wicketkeeper and averaging 37.13 with the bat. [65]
Gilchrist won a silver medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur , the only time cricket has been in the Commonwealth Games. The matches did not have ODI status, and after winning their first four fixtures, Australia lost the final to South Africa, Gilchrist making 15. [21] [66] He then scored 103 and ended with 190 runs at 63.33 as Australia took a rare 3–0 whitewash on Pakistani soil. [21]
Gilchrist was in fine form ahead of the 1999 Cricket World Cup with a productive individual performance in the Carlton & United Series in January and February 1999 against Sri Lanka and England. He finished with 525 runs at a batting average of 43.75 with two centuries—both against Sri Lanka—and a fifty, and a total of 27 dismissals in 12 matches. [67] [68] His 131 helped Australia set a successful run-chase at the SCG, and he followed this with 154 at the MCG. [21] The 1999 tour of the West Indies was Australia's last campaign before the World Cup and continued to prove Gilchrist's ability as a wicketkeeper-batsman. Gilchrist, with a batting average of 28.71 and a strike rate of nearly 90.00, and seven fielding dismissals in a seven-match series which ended 3–3 with one tie. [69]
First World Cup success[ edit ]
Main article: 1999 Cricket World Cup
Gilchrist played in every match of Australia's successful World Cup campaign, [70] but struggled at first, with scores of 6, 14 and 0 in the first three matches against Scotland , New Zealand and Pakistan. [21] Australia lost the latter two matches and had to avoid defeat for six consecutive matches to reach the final. [71] Gilchrist's quick-fire 63 runs in 39 balls against Bangladesh helped the Australians into the Super Six stage of the tournament, [72] which was secured with a win over the West Indies, although Gilchrist made only 21. [21] Gilchrist continued to struggle in the Super Six phase, scoring 31, 10 and 5 against India, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Australia won all three matches, [21] the last in the final over, [73] to scrape into the semifinals. [21] Gilchrist made only 20 in the semifinal against South Africa, [21] but completed the final act of the match. With the scores tied, South Africa were going for the winning run when Gilchrist broke the stumps to complete the run out of Allan Donald ; [73] the match was tied, [21] and Australia proceeded to the final as they had won the group stage match against South Africa. Gilchrist's 54 in the final helped secure Australia's first world title since 1987 with an eight wicket victory over Pakistan . [74] It was a happy ending for Gilchrist, who had struggled through the tournament, with 237 runs at 21.54. [21]
Success at the World Cup was followed by a defeat by Sri Lanka in the final of the Aiwa Cup in August 1999, [75] despite Gilchrist being the most successful batsman and wicket-keeper of the tournament, [76] with 231 runs at 46.20. [21] While the Test players battled against Sri Lanka, Gilchrist led Australia A in a limited overs series against India A in Los Angeles. [77] He then scored 60 runs at 20.00 as the Australians completed a 3–0 whitewash of Zimbabwe in October. [21] [78]
Test debut[ edit ]
Gilchrist made his Test match debut in the First Test against Pakistan at the Gabba in Brisbane in November 1999 [79] becoming the 381st Australian Test cricketer. [80] He replaced Healy, who was dropped after a run of poor form, despite the incumbent's entreaties to the selectors to allow him a farewell game in front of his home crowd. [81] Gilchrist's entry into the Test arena coincided with a dramatic rise in Australia's fortunes. [82] Up to this point, they had played eight Tests in 1999, winning and losing three. [83]
Gilchrist's icy reception at the Gabba did not faze him; [84] he took five catches, stumped Azhar Mahmood off Shane Warne 's bowling and scored a rapid 81, mostly in partnership with ODI partner Waugh, in a match that Australia won comfortably by ten wickets. [79] In his second Test match he made an unbeaten 149 to help guide Australia to victory in a game that looked well beyond their reach. [85] [86] Australia were struggling at 5/126 in pursuit of 369 for victory as he joined his Western Australian team-mate, Justin Langer , but the pair put on a record-breaking partnership of 238 to seal an Australian win. [85] [86] [87] Gilchrist continued his strong run throughout his debut Test season, and ended the summer with 485 runs at 69.28 in six matches, three each against Pakistan and India, adding two fifties against the latter. [21]
Gilchrist was moderately successful in the following ODIs, the Carlton & United Series; Australia defeated Pakistan 2–0 in a best-of-three final. [88] Gilchrist scored 272 runs at 27.20; his best effort was 92 in a 152-run victory over India on Australia Day . [21] Gilchrist then scored 251 runs at 41.66 in the ODIs during a tour of New Zealand. [21] The highlight was a 128 in Christchurch that propelled Australia to a score of 6/349. [21] Gilchrist was named man of the match in two of the games.
In the Third Test against New Zealand in 2000, Gilchrist recorded the third best Test performance ever by a wicketkeeper, and the best by an Australian, [89] taking ten catches in the match. [90] Although Gilchrist's batting was modest, yielding 144 runs at 36.00, [21] Australia took a 3–0 clean sweep. [91] In two home and away ODI series against South Africa, Gilchrist had a quiet time, scoring 170 runs at 26.66. [21] South Africa won three of the six matches, with one tie. [89]
Later that year, he was handed the vice-captaincy of the Australian team in place of Shane Warne , who had been plagued by a number of off-the-field controversies, including an altercation with some teenage boys, [92] and a sex scandal with a British nurse. [93] [94]
The 2000–01 season saw a West Indian touring party and Gilchrist warmed up with consecutive first-class centuries for Western Australia. [21] Captaining his Test team for the first time in place of the injured Steve Waugh in the Third Test in Adelaide . Gilchrist scored only 9 and 10 not out, [21] but a ten-wicket haul from Colin Miller resulted in a hard-fought five-wicket victory for Australia. [95] Gilchrist described the match as "the proudest moment of my career". [96] Waugh resumed the captaincy on his return to the team for the Fourth and Fifth Tests, with the series finishing in a 5–0 whitewash. [97] Gilchrist scored 241 runs at 48.20 with two fifties. [21] In the ensuing ODI tournament, Gilchrist scored 326 runs at 36.22 with a top-score of 98 as the Australians won all ten matches. [21] [98]
Up to this point, Gilchrist had played in 14 Tests, all in Australasia, and all of which had been won. [21] Australia's run of 15 consecutive Test wins faced a steep challenge on the tour of India , where they had not won a Test series since 1969–70. [98]
Australia's streak looked in danger during the First Test in Mumbai when they fell to 5/99 in reply to India's 171 when Gilchrist came to the crease. He counterattacked savagely, scoring 122 in just 112 balls, and featuring in a 197-run partnership with Matthew Hayden in only 32 overs . [99] This swung the momentum back to Australia, who reached 349. Gilchrist took six catches and was named Man of the Match in a ten wicket victory, [100] extending the world record run to 16. [98]
Gilchrist's form dipped momentarily, with a rare king pair (two golden ducks in the same match) in the Second Test in Kolkata and just two runs in his two innings in Chennai . He was out LBW four consecutive times in the last two Tests, [101] [102] three of these to Harbhajan Singh , who took 32 wickets in the series to end Australia's run by inflicting a 2–1 series loss. [103] His one-day form remained strong, with 172 runs at 43.00 in the ODI series in India, as Australia bounced back to win the series 3–2. [104] During this series he captained the ODI team for the first time, winning all three of the matches under his captaincy. [105]
Main article: Ashes 2001
Gilchrist played a pivotal role in the 2001 Ashes series which Australia won 4–1, with 340 runs at a batting average of 68.00 and 26 dismissals in the five match series. [106]
Gilchrist warmed up by putting his ODI struggles on English soil in 1999 behind him, scoring 248 runs at 49.60 in the triangular tournament preceding the Tests, scoring an unbeaten 76 in the final win over Pakistan. [21]
Gilchrist put the disappointment of India behind him in the First Test at Edgbaston , scoring 152 from only 143 balls. The allowed Australia to reach 576 in only 545 minutes, and set up an innings victory that set the tone for the series. [107] Gilchrist then added 90 in the eight-wicket win in the Second Test at Lord's , [21] [107] before turning the tide in the Third Test at Trent Bridge . Australia slumped to 7/105 in reply to the hosts' 185, but Gilchrist's 54 took the tourists to 190 before a seven-wicket win resulted in the retention of the Ashes. [108]
Gilchrist captained the team in the Fourth Test at Headingley after an injury to Steve Waugh. [109] After persistent rain interruptions, Gilchrist declared with Australia four down at tea on the fourth day, leaving England with a target of 315, which, despite losing two early wickets, they reached with six wickets to spare, ( Mark Butcher scoring an unbeaten 173, including 24 boundaries [109] ). [108] [110] Gilchrist failed to pass 25 in the last two Tests, but it had been a productive season; he scored centuries in both of Australia's county matches. [21]
Two home series followed in the 2001–02 season, a fully drawn (0–0) three match series against New Zealand and a whitewash over South Africa 3–0. [105] Gilchrist scored 118 in the First Test against New Zealand and an unbeaten 83 in the Third Test in Perth as the Australians held on for a draw with three wickets intact. [21] However, Gilchrist did little in the triumph over South Africa, failing to pass 35. He ended the summer Tests with 353 runs at 50.42. [21]
In the ensuing ODIs, Gilchrist scored only 97 runs at 16.16. [21] The Australian selectors sought to accommodate Hayden, who had been successful as a Test opener, into the ODI team by rotating him with Gilchrist and Waugh, but this appeared to unsettle the team. With a newly fragile top-order, Australia failed to qualify for the finals, and the Waugh brothers were dropped from the team, ending Gilchrist's four-year partnership with Mark. Ricky Ponting was promoted to the captaincy ahead of vice captain Gilchrist. [111]
The Australians then toured South Africa the next month and it was during the First Test in Johannesburg that Gilchrist broke the record for the fastest double century in Tests on 23 February, [112] requiring 212 balls for the feat. [113] This was eight balls quicker than Ian Botham 's innings against India at The Oval in 1982 . [114] He ended unbeaten on 204, having featured in a partnership of 317 with Damien Martyn at a run rate of 5.5. South Africa were demoralised and lost by an innings after being forced to follow on . [115] The record lasted only one month, however, with New Zealand's Nathan Astle taking 59 balls less to reach the milestone during an innings in March 2002. [116]
In the Second Test at Cape Town , Gilchrist struck 138 from 108 balls to set up a first innings lead and eventual four-wicket win. He then top-scored with 91 in the Third Test, and although Australia lost the match, [115] Gilchrist ended the series with an astonishing 473 at 157.66 from just 474 balls, in addition to 14 dismissals. [115] [117]
Gilchrist captained the ODI team, once again for a single match, against Kenya in Nairobi during the PSO Tri-Nation Tournament. [118] Despite Australia's unbeaten run in the competition, the final, against Pakistan was abandoned due to rain, so the teams shared the trophy. [119] During the six middle months of 2002, Gilchrist played in 18 ODIs, scoring 562 runs at 31.22, including a century, recovering from his slump. [21]
After scoring 122 runs at 40.66 in the 3–0 Test series clean sweep over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , [21] Gilchrist went on to help the Australians retain The Ashes 4–1 in 2002–03 , playing in all five matches of the series, finishing with 330 runs at 55.50 and taking 25 dismissals as wicket-keeper. [120] After scoring fifties in the first two Tests, Gilchrist scored a counter-attacking 133 from 121 balls in the Fifth Test at the SCG, but was unable to prevent Australia's only loss of the series. [21] [121]
From the time of his debut up to the 2003 World Cup, Gilchrist's played in 40 Tests in series. [122] With the exception of the 2001 tour of India, when he averaged 24.80 (he made 124 runs in the series; 122 of them came in one innings), his performances with the bat were such that he was described at the time as the "finest batsman-wicketkeeper to have graced the game". [122] [123] At one point in March 2002, Gilchrist's Test average was over 60; the second-highest for any established player in Test history, [124] and he topped the ICC Test batting rankings in May 2002. [125]
Gilchrist warmed up for the World Cup in South Africa by scoring 310 runs at 44.28 in the triangular tournament in Australia against England and Sri Lanka. [21] [126] His performances over the past year were recognised with the Allan Border Medal .
2003 World Cup[ edit ]
Main article: 2003 Cricket World Cup
Gilchrist played in all but one of the matches in Australia's successful defence of their World Cup title; [127] he was rested for the group match against the Netherlands . He finished the tournament with 408 runs at an average of 40.80 at a strike rate of 105. He scored four half-centuries, and was run out against Sri Lanka in the Super Six stage just a single run short of a century. [128] In the semi-final, he scored 22 before being caught off an inside-edge onto pad off the bowling of Aravinda de Silva . The umpire gave no reaction, however Gilchrist walked off the pitch after a moment's pause. In 2009 it was described as an "astonishing moment" drawing criticism from England's Angus Fraser , who "objected to him being canonised simply for not cheating", and from others who "thought that he walked almost by accident; that having played his shot he overbalanced in the direction of the pavilion." His actions nevertheless drew praise from the majority. [16] In the final, India elected to field first and Gilchrist hammered 57 from 48 balls, featuring in a century opening stand with Hayden to seize the initiative. This laid the foundation for Australia's 2/359 and a crushing 125-run win, ending an unbeaten campaign. [21] [129] Gilchrist was also the competition's most successful wicketkeeper, making 21 dismissals. [130]
Success in the World Cup was followed up by a tour of the West Indies where Gilchrist was part of a side that won both the ODI and Test series. [131] He scored 282 runs at 70.50 with one century in the four Tests, and 212 runs at 35.33 in the ODIs. [21] The Australians then defeated a touring Bangladeshi cricket team in short series in both forms of the game. [132] Gilchrist was only sporadically required with the bat. [21]
Decline and revival[ edit ]
After scoring his first Test century at his home ground in Perth, an unbeaten 113 against Zimbabwe, [21] Gilchrist's Test form dipped again during the 2003–04 season, with only 120 runs coming in the next 10 innings, during the home series against India (drawn 1–1) and the away series in Sri Lanka (won 3–0). [105] However, he returned to form in the Second Test Kandy , scoring a quickfire 144 in the second innings to set up a 27-run win after Australia conceded a 91-run first innings lead. [21] [105]
However, he maintained high standards in ODIs during this period, including 111 against India in Bangalore , 172 against Zimbabwe, just one run short of Mark Waugh's Australian record, and two further half-centuries in the VB Series in Australia. [133] His success in One-day cricket was underlined by his rise to the top of the ICC ODI batting rankings in February 2004. [134] However, he was unable to maintain this form on the 2004 tours of Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and the Champions Trophy in England, accumulating 253 runs at 28.11 in 11 innings. [21] [133]
Gilchrist then scored 115 runs at 28.75 in two Tests at home to Sri Lanka in mid-2004, [21] and captained in the First Test win in Darwin with Ponting absent. Australia won the series 1–0. [21]
A 104 in the First Test against India in October 2004 proved to be a false renaissance; [135] he scored only 104 runs in the remaining seven innings on the Indian tour and 139 runs in eight ODI innings towards the end of the 2004–05 season, which formed the lowest average period of Gilchrist's career until 2007. [105] [133] He took the captaincy of the Test team once again, in place of the injured Ricky Ponting , [136] and led the Australian side to an historic 2–1 series victory in India , a feat last achieved in 1969. [137] Ponting recovered to lead the team in the Fourth Test, Australia's only loss.
Gilchrist returned to form when New Zealand toured Australia at the start of southern hemisphere season. He scored 126 and 50 in the 2–0 Test series clean sweep and scored fifties in both ODIs. [21] He then scored 230 runs at 76.66 in three Tests against Pakistan, including a rapid 113 in the Third Test at the SCG as Australia won all five Tests during the summer. [21] He made it three successive Test centuries with 121 and 162 in the first two Tests on the tour of New Zealand, [138] before ending with an unbeaten 60 in the Third Test; he totalled 343 runs at 114.33 for the series. [21] His ODI form in the early part of 2005 remained moderate, with 308 runs at 28.00 during the southern summer. [21]
December 2005. At his home ground, the WACA , Gilchrist faces Makhaya Ntini , in the First Test , Australia v South Africa .
Gilchrist was in strong form ahead of the Tests, scoring 393 runs at 49.13 in the ODIs in England. [21] The highlight was the 121 not out in the final game of the one-day NatWest Series , Gilchrist being awarded the man-of-the-match award. [139] However, he performed poorly in the five Tests, with 204 runs at 25.50. [140] Just as in India in 2001, Australia lost 2–1, [141] and Gilchrist fell four times to man of the series Andrew Flintoff .
Australia and Gilchrist returned to form after the Ashes in the series against the ICC World XI. Gilchrist scored 45, 103 and 32 as Australia swept the ODIs 3–0, and top-scored with 94 in the first innings of the one-off Test, which Australia won. [21] However, this did not transfer into the regular international matches. In six home Tests against the West Indies and South Africa in 2005–06, Gilchrist managed only 190 runs at 23.75, [21] but Australia was unhindered, winning 3–0 and 2–0 respectively. [21]
Gilchrist with Australia in 2006
His one-day form also began to suffer, scoring only 11 runs in three ODIs in New Zealand and 13 in the first two matches of the VB Series. [133] He was rested for two games and returned to form against Sri Lanka on 29 January 2006 on his home ground, the WACA , hitting 116 runs off 105 balls to lead Australia to victory. [142] He continued in this vein with the fastest ever century by an Australian in just 67 balls against Sri Lanka at the Gabba, ending with 122 as Australia won the deciding third final by nine wickets. [143] After a slow start, he ended the series with 432 runs at 48.00. [21]
The purple patch ended on the tour of South Africa and then Bangladesh. He scored 206 runs at 29.42 in five Tests and 248 runs at 35.42 in eight ODIs, inflated by a 144 in the First Test against Bangladesh. [21] Despite this, Australia won all five Tests. [141] Gilchrist scored 130 runs at 26.00, including a 92 against the West Indies as Australia won the 2006 Champions Trophy in India. [21]
On 16 December 2006, during the Third Ashes Test at the WACA, Gilchrist scored a century in 57 balls, including twelve fours and four sixes, [144] the second fastest recorded Test century. [8] At 97 runs from 54 balls, Gilchrist needed three runs from the next delivery to better Viv Richards' record set in 1986. [145] The ball delivered by Matthew Hoggard was wide and Gilchrist was unable to score from it. [146] He later claimed that the "batting pyrotechnics" had been the result of a miscommunication with the Australian captain Ricky Ponting; Gilchrist had actually been told not to score quick runs with a view to declaring the innings. [147]
He ended the 2006–07 Ashes with a century and two fifties, totalling 229 runs at 45.80 at a strike rate of over 100 as Australia regained the Ashes with a 5–0 whitewash. [148] It was an inconsistent series; aside from three scores mentioned, Gilchrist failed to pass one in his other three innings. [21] Between Ashes series, Gilchrist had averaged only 25 with one Test century. [21]
However, both he and Australia suffered a surprising string of poor results in the 2006-07 Commonwealth Bank Series , Gilchrist managing an average of only 22.20 during the tournament. [21] Australia won seven of their eight qualifying matches, [21] but England won with two finals victories over the Australians. [149] Gilchrist scored 60 and 61 in the first two matches but did not pass 30 thereafter. [21] He was then rested for Australia's winless three-match ODI tour of New Zealand, [150] before his selection for the 2007 Cricket World Cup . [151] Having previously indicated that it was highly likely that he would retire after the 2007 World Cup, [152] he then stated a desire to play on aftwerwards. [153]
2007 World Cup[ edit ]
Main article: 2007 Cricket World Cup
Gilchrist and Australia started their 2007 World Cup campaign successfully, winning all three of their matches in Group A, against Scotland , [154] the Netherlands and South Africa . [21] Australia won all six of their matches in the Super8 stage with little difficulty—the margins of victory were exceeded 80 runs or six wickets in every instance. [21] They topped the table and thus qualifying for a semi-final rematch against fourth-placed South Africa. Gilchrist opened the Australian batting in each match, taking a pinch-hitting role in the opening powerplays . Initially successful in the group matches, scoring 46, 57 and 42, he failed in the first Super8 match against West Indies (7), but bounced back to score a second half-century (59 not out) in a ten-wicket victory against Bangladesh in a match drastically shortened due to rain. After a run of middling scores, he failed again in the final Super8 match against New Zealand . [21]
As a batsman, Gilchrist was dismissed for a single run in the semi-final against South Africa, despite which Australia won by seven wickets. [21] As wicket-keeper, however, he took four catches, equalling the most dismissals in one match in the tournament and bringing his total for the tournament to 14, second behind Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara .
Gilchrist opened the batting against Sri Lanka in the final. This was Gilchrist's third successive World Cup final, and the third time he scored at least a 50 runs in World Cup finals and he went on to make his only ever century in a world cup match. [21] Gilchrist went on to score 149 runs off 104 balls with thirteen fours and eight sixes, the highest individual score in a World Cup final, eclipsing his captain Ricky Ponting's score of 140 in the 2003 final. Australia won and he was named the man of the match . Subsequently there has been some controversy over Gilchrist's use of a squash ball inside his glove during this innings. [155] The MCC stated that Gilchrist had not acted against the laws or the spirit of the game, since there is no restriction against the external or internal form of batting gloves. [156]
Play media

In September 2007, Gilchrist played in the inaugural World Twenty20 . He scored 169 runs at 33.80 as Australia were knocked out by India in the semifinals. [21] Gilchrist then scored 208 runs at 34.66 as Australia took an away ODI series against India 4–2. [21] In November, Gilchrist's peers voted him the greatest Australian ODI cricketer ever, for which he was awarded an honour at an ACA function before Australia's second Test against Sri Lanka. [157] He was only required to bat once in the Tests, and made 67 not out as Australia swept Sri Lanka aside 2–0. [21]
Retirement[ edit ]
On 26 January 2008 during the 4th and final Test of the 2007–08 series against India, Gilchrist announced that he would retire from international cricket at the end of the season. [158] A back injury kept Ricky Ponting off the field for sections of the Indian's second innings, resulting in Gilchrist captaining the team for the part of final two days of his Test cricket career. [159] India batted out the match for a draw, so Gilchrist's 14 in the first innings was his final Test innings; he took his 379th and final catch when Virender Sehwag was caught behind. [160] Gilchrist had scored only 150 runs at 21.42 in his final Test series. [21]
John Buchanan , who coached Australia during most of Gilchrist's international career, predicted that Gilchrist's retirement would have more impact than the previous year's retirements of Damien Martyn , Glenn McGrath , Shane Warne and Justin Langer and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd asked Gilchrist to reconsider. [161] Gilchrist later revealed that he chose to retire after dropping VVS Laxman during the first innings, and realising that he had lost his "competitive edge." [162] He played out the summer's ODI series, before ending in disappointment when India beat Australia 2–0 in the 2007-08 Commonwealth Bank Series finals. [163] Gilchrist managed only seven and two in the finals. [21] His highlight of the series was his scoring 118 and being named Man of the Match in his final match at his adopted home in Perth on 15 February 2008, against Sri Lanka. [164] He ended his final series with 322 runs at 32.20. [21]
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
Gilchrist was contracted by the Hyderabad-based Deccan Chargers in the inaugural season's player auction for US$700,000. In Deccan's fourth match of the inaugural 2008 season, Gilchrist hammered the second fastest hundred in the IPL, off just 42 balls, as Deccan recorded their first win, against Mumbai. Gilchrist led the Deccan Chargers in the second half of the IPL in the absence of regular captain VVS Laxman , who was ruled out for the rest of the tournament due to injury. Deccan came last, winning only two of 14 matches.
In the second season, Gilchrist was installed as captain in place of Laxman by new coach and former Australian teammate Darren Lehmann . The team started well and won their first four matches but stumbled and won only three of their remaining ten qualifying matches. They qualified fourth into the semifinals and Gilchrist led the team to the final by striking 85 off just 35 balls against the Delhi Daredevils . Although made a duck in the final against the Royal Challengers Bangalore , Deccan won by six runs to take the title. Gilchrist was named the Player of The Tournament.
In the fourth season, Gilchrist was contracted by Kings XI Punjab for US$900,000. He was chosen the captain for the team as Kumar Sangakkara (former captain of Punjab) had moved to Deccan Chargers. In March 2012 he was named "player-coach", replacing his friend and former Australia teammate Michael Bevan , whose contract as head coach was not renewed. [165] Gilchrist had speculated on retiring from the IPL at the end of the 2012 season, after Kings XI Punjab failed to make it to the play-offs. [166]
In the sixth season, Gilchrist made a comeback for his final IPL stint. He stated the reason as being the Kings XI management's decision to renew his contract for another season. [167] An interesting change in the team staff was the induction of Darren Lehmann as the new Kings XI coach. [168] This brought together the duo of Gilchrist and Lehmann who had guided their previous franchise, the Deccan Chargers to its 2009 IPL victory. Some good performances by the players led the Kings XI Punjab team eyeing for the fourth spot in the play-offs and a possible maiden win under Gilchrist's leadership. They were knocked out very late in the tournament. In his final game at IPL, Gilchrist decided to bowl the last over of the match against the Mumbai Indians , where he got the wicket of Harbhajan Singh of his first ball, securing KXIP's victory in the match. In a recent press conference, Gilchrist has confirmed that this will be his final IPL season and that he was looking forward to a fresh start in the inaugural Caribbean Premier League in July 2013. [169]
Middlesex[ edit ]
He signed a short-term contract in November 2009 to play English Twenty20 cricket for Middlesex between 3 and 24 June 2010. He was appointed interim captain on 11 June upon the sudden resignation of Shaun Udal . In addition to the seven Twenty20 fixtures, he is also captaining the county versus the touring Australians in a fifty-over friendly.
In addition to this he will be taking part in the major sporting events Titans of Cricket in October 2011 [170] – an evening of exciting challenges for famous sportsmen, touring across the UK in Manchester and Birmingham, with the grand finale in London's O2
In July 2014, he played for the Rest of the World side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's . [171]
Style of play[ edit ]
Gilchrist standing up to Shane Warne in 2005. Andrew Strauss is the batsman.
Gilchrist's attacking batting has been a key part of Australia's one-day success, as he usually opens the batting. He was a part of the successful 1999 , 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cup campaigns. [172] [173] Gilchrist's Test batting average in the upper 40s is unusually high for a wicket-keeper. [174] He is currently 45th on the all–time list of highest batting averages. [174] He maintains a Test strike-rate of 82 runs per hundred balls, the highest since balls were recorded in full. His combination of attack and consistency create one of the most dynamic world cricketers ever, [175] playing shots to all areas of the field with uncommon timing. He is also the only international test player to score 100 sixes. Gilchrist's skills as a wicket-keeper are sometimes questioned; some people would claim that he is the best keeper in Australia while Victorian wicket-keeper Darren Berry was regarded by many as the best Australian wicket-keeper of the 1990s and early 2000s. [176] [177]
In this role, Gilchrist is perhaps disadvantaged by his relatively tall stature for a pure wicket-keeper. However, while perhaps not as elegant as some, he has successfully kept wicket for spin bowler Shane Warne and fast bowlers Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee for most of his international career. His partnerships with McGrath and Lee are second and fourth respectively in both test and ODI history for the number of wickets taken. [178] [179] With Alec Stewart and Mark Boucher , he shares the record for most catches (6) by a wicketkeeper in a ODI match, however he has now achieved this feat five times, the most recent versus India in 2008 CB Series. [180] The match in 2007 was also the second time he took six dismissals and scored a half century in the same ODI; he remains the only player to do so even once. [181] At Old Trafford in August 2005, he passed Alec Stewart's world record of 4,540 runs as a Test wicketkeeper, [182] Statistically, he is currently the most successful ODI wicket-keeper in history; with 417 catches and 55 stumpings, a total of 472 dismissals, his closest rival, Mark Boucher, is more than 80 dismissals behind. [183]
Walking and discipline[ edit ]
Cricket has for many years debated whether batsmen should " walk ", that is to agree that they have been dismissed and leave the field of play without waiting for (or contrary to) an umpire's decision. Gilchrist reignited this debate parcel of the game. You have to play the role of the senior when someone is injured. Whoever you have in the team, you need to go ahead and give your best shot."
Given India's recent spate of injuries, the selectors have taken the opportunity to blood a few new players during the recently completed one-day series against England and the first Test against West Indies. Among the new faces in the ODIs were Umesh Yadav and Varun Aaron , while Yadav played in the Test win over West Indies in Delhi. Both bowlers impressed with their pace and Ishant said it was a "great feeling" to be part of an attack that can bowl quick.
"Earlier, everyone was saying that India can't produce fast bowlers. Now all the three fast bowlers are consistently clocking 90 miles per hour. Obviously it's a great feeling for any fast bowler in the team."
When he was asked why India's bowlers failed to get reverse-swing at the Feroz Shah Kotla, Ishant it was difficult to do so on the first day when the track was fresh. "The only thing you can do is to be consistent and bowl in the right areas. As the day progresses, you get reverse-swing. Reverse-swing happens only on second or third day of a Test match.
"The Australia tour is after this series. We will get two practice matches there to get accustomed to the conditions. In India, the wickets are like this only. We can't complain about this."

Early life and Domestic career[ edit ]
Dale Steyn grew up in the small town of Phalaborwa on the border of the world-famous wildlife haven, the Kruger National Park . Active and energetic, Steyn was naturally drawn to sports. His love of being outdoors led him also to more solitary activities such as bass fishing and skateboarding. Steyn began playing cricket when he was around 11 years old and he received a Hansie Cronje cricket set as a Christmas gift. Family games on the lawn soon led to a place in the school cricket team. During his high school years at Merensky High School in the town of Tzaneen, Steyn had exceptional pace and a raw talent, but a career in cricket didn’t seem possible. “When you live in a small town and there is just a handful of players, it doesn’t really count that you may be the cream of the crop,” Steyn comments “People might say you’re destined for great things. But when you’re in a small town, what are the chances?”
Steyn made his first-class debut for Northerns (subsequently merged with Easterns to form the Titans ) on 17 October 2003. He only played two first-class games and made little impact in his first season, but a series of strong performances in the initial part of the 2004/2005 season saw him called up to the Test squad to play England . He went back to playing for the Titans after failing to impress in his first three Tests.
Steyn went to England in 2005 to play for Essex , appearing in seven matches between May and June. He failed to make a big impact in his initial outing in County Championship cricket, taking 14 wickets at 59.85. [16] Following his work at Essex with world expert bowling coach Ian Pont Steyn returned to domestic cricket in South Africa, where he bowled excellently for the Titans through the 2005/2006 season which earned him a recall to the Test squad to face New Zealand . [17]
Steyn seized the opportunity to cement his place in the South Africa Test team, and as a result of becoming a regular selection for the national team, he has subsequently played little domestic cricket in South Africa during the last two seasons, appearing for the Titans in just three SuperSport Series matches.
He had a second stint in England, playing for Warwickshire in the first half of the 2007 English season. This time around he had more success, claiming 23 County Championship wickets in seven matches at an average of 25.86. [16] He also played well in the Friends Provident Trophy , a 50-over tournament, finishing as the leading wicket-taker for Warwickshire. He has since become a regular in the South African One Day International team.
Dale Steyn signed to play in the Indian Premier League in 2008, playing for the Royal Challengers Bangalore . He earned US$325,000 for his appearance in the tournament. [18] For IPL 2011 he was bought by Deccan Chargers for $1.2 million. [19]

Home Tests against England 2004/05[ edit ]
Dale Steyn made his debut for South Africa on 17 December 2004 in the first Test of England's tour. His first victim in Test cricket was Marcus Trescothick whom he bowled with a fast in-swinging delivery. [20] However, his overall performance was underwhelming, he took eight wickets at an average of 52.00 [21] and he was dropped after bowling poorly in England's second innings of the fourth Test in January 2005, bowling eight no balls in nine overs which went for 47 runs. [22] England won the match by 77 runs.
One Day Internationals 2005/06[ edit ]
Later that year, Steyn was picked in the squad for the African XI in the Afro-Asia Cup of 2005/06, and he made his One Day International debut on 17 August 2005. The African XI won the match, with Steyn bowling last batsman Ashish Nehra to seal victory by two runs. [23] Steyn made his One Day International debut for South Africa on 20 January 2006 in a match against Australia at Melbourne , a match which was part of the 2005-06 VB Series . Steyn did not bowl particularly well [24] and after another below par performance against Sri Lanka [25] he dropped out of consideration for the South African ODI team.
Home Tests against New Zealand 2005/2006[ edit ]
Following a strong season playing domestic cricket for the Titans , Steyn was recalled to the Test side to play New Zealand in April 2006. He responded to his opportunity with his first five-wicket haul in the first Test at Centurion , ripping through the New Zealand batting lineup along with Makhaya Ntini as New Zealand crumbled to 120 all out, chasing 248 to win. [26] He finished the three Test series with 16 wickets at 26.00 [27] and made a fine impression throughout.
Away Tests against Sri Lanka 2006[ edit ]
Steyn was included in the Test team to play Sri Lanka away in a two match series in July and August 2006. In his first overseas Test, at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground , Colombo , he took 3 for 129 as Sri Lanka piled up 756–5, with Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene putting together the highest Test match partnership ever (624 runs). South Africa slumped to defeat by an innings and 153 runs. [28] In the second Test, at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium , Colombo , Steyn took his second five-wicket haul in Tests during Sri Lanka's first innings, but went wicketless in their seconds innings as Sri Lanka sealed a 2–0 series victory by a single wicket. [29] Steyn finished the series with eight wickets at an average of 36.50. [27]
Home Tests against India 2006/07[ edit ]
Steyn his Test place for the three match home series against India . He picked up an injury whilst bowling early in India's first innings in the first Test at Johannesburg which prevented him from taking much further part in the game and also ruled him out of the second Test. He returned to play in the deciding third Test at Cape Town and bowled well, taking six wickets for 88 runs in the match as South Africa clinched the match and the series. [30] He finished the series with six wickets at an average of 19.00. [31]
Home Tests against Pakistan 2006/07[ edit ]
Despite his strong performance on his return to the team in the third Test against India, Steyn missed out on a place in the first two Tests against Pakistan , with the selectors opting to play a four-man attack featuring full-time spinner Paul Harris . He returned in the third Test, at Cape Town , when the selectors decided to rest André Nel and Shaun Pollock in preparation for the imminent 2007 Cricket World Cup . He took four wickets in the match for 87 runs as South Africa won the match by 5 wickets and took the series 2–1. [32] As this was his only match, his average for the series was 21.75. [31]
One Day Internationals 2007[ edit ]
Steyn was recalled to the South African ODI squad in June 2007 and played in three matches between June and August, against Ireland , India and Zimbabwe . He had mixed success in these three matches, taking wickets but proving expensive. [33]
Away Tests against Pakistan 2007/2008[ edit ]
Steyn was picked for the Test squad to tour Pakistan in October, and played in both Tests. In the first Test at Karachi , during Pakistan's second innings, he picked up his third Test five-wicket haul as Pakistan were bowled out for 263 chasing 424 to win. [34] He had an unremarkable second Test, with the match petering out to a draw, handing South Africa the series 1–0, and finished the series with nine wickets at 24.66. [35]
Home Tests, ODIs and T20 against New Zealand 2007/2008[ edit ]
Steyn was by now an established member of the Test team, and he produced his finest series performance to date in the two Test matches against New Zealand in November. In the first Test at Johannesburg he collected his fourth and fifth five-wicket hauls (5/35 and 5/59) and his first ten-wicket match as New Zealand were thrashed by 358 runs, South Africa's biggest victory margin in terms of runs to date. Steyn was also awarded his first Test Man-of-the-Match award. [36] This devastating form continued into the second Test at Centurion where he picked up 4/42 in the first innings and his sixth five-wicket haul (6/49) to help South Africa to victory by an innings and 59 runs. His second ten-wicket match earned him his second Man-of-the-Match award in a row [37] and his series performance of 20 wickets at an average of 9.20 [38] won him his first Man-of-the-Series award. On the back of his performance, he broke into the top five of the ICC rankings for Test bowlers for the first time in his career. [39]
He made his Twenty20 International debut on 23 November 2007 in the one-off game against New Zealand, taking the wicket of Scott Styris and only giving up 17 runs from his four overs. [40] He also featured in the third One Day International at Cape Town , where he had partial success, taking the wickets of the New Zealand openers, Brendon McCullum and Lou Vincent , but going for 50 runs from nine overs. [41]
Home Tests, ODIs and T20 against West Indies 2007/2008[ edit ]
Steyn's next international appearance was in the first Twenty20 International against the West Indies . He took the exceptional figures of 4/9 in three overs, with all four wickets being picture perfect yorkers, but was unable to stop the West Indies chasing down the target of 59 runs in a match reduced to 13 overs by rain. [42]
Steyn's form continued into the Test series. He had a fairly indifferent match in the first Test at Port Elizabeth , taking 5/188 in the match as the West Indies scored their first away victory in Test matches for two and a half years, although he did hit his highest Test match score to date, 33 not out, in South Africa's second innings. [43] He picked up figures of 4/60 and 4/44 in the second Test at Cape Town as South Africa leveled the series [44] and once again proved his worth in the deciding third Test at Durban by taking 1/18 and 6/72, his seventh five-wicket haul, as the West Indies were thrashed by an innings and 100 runs. [45] His 20 wickets at 19.10. [38] earned him his second consecutive Man-of-the-Series award.
He played in the first three matches of the One Day International series, but could not match his Test success and was briefly dropped after failing to take a wicket and going for 62 runs in his ten overs during the third match at Port Elizabeth [46] He was recalled for the fifth match at Johannesburg but struggled again, taking one wicket but going for 78 runs from ten overs. [47]
Away Tests and ODIs against Bangladesh 2007/08[ edit ]
In the first Test of the two match series against Bangladesh , at Dhaka , Steyn helped South Africa avoid an embarrassing defeat. Bangladesh were bowled out for 192 in their first innings, with Steyn claiming 3/27, but then South Africa collapsed to 170 all out, handing the hosts a shock 22 run lead. However Steyn(4/48) then combined with Jacques Kalt. [16]

Early and personal life[ edit ]
Suresh's father is a retired military officer and mother Parvesh Raina[ clarification needed ]. [2] The Raina family - which belongs to the Kashmiri Pandit community [3] - moved in the 1980s from the Rainawari area of Srinagar , Kashmir, to Muradnagar , Ghaziabad district in Uttar Pradesh . [4] He lives in Rajnagar, a town in Ghaziabad , Uttar Pradesh . He has three older brothers Dinesh Raina, Naresh Raina and Mukesh Raina and one elder sister Renu. [2] [5] [6] An article by Suresh Raina was featured in the 2012 book Rahul Dravid: Timeless Steel . Suresh Raina married Priyanka Chaudhary [7] on April 3, 2015. [8] [9] Suresh Raina has lent his voice to the soundtrack of the film Meeruthiya Gangster . [10]
Career[ edit ]
Raina decided to play cricket in 2000, and moved from his city Muradnagar , Ghaziabad , Uttar Pradesh (near New Delhi) to Lucknow , to attend the specialist government Sports College. [2] He rose to become the captain of the Uttar Pradesh U-16s and came to prominence amongst Indian selectors in 2002, when he was selected at the age of 15 and a half years for the U-19 tour to England, where he made a pair of half-centuries in the U-19 Test matches. [11] He toured Sri Lanka later that year with the U-17 team. He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Uttar Pradesh against Assam in February 2003 at the age of 16, but did not play another match until the following season. In late 2003, he toured Pakistan for the U-19 Asian ODI Championship before being selected for the 2004 U-19 World Cup, where he scored three half centuries, including a 90 scored off only 38 balls. He was then awarded a Border-Gavaskar scholarship to train at the Australian Cricket Academy and in early 2005, he made his first-class limited overs debut, and scored 645 runs that season at an average of 53.75. [12]
2010 South Africa tour of India[ edit ]
See also: List of centuries in Twenty20 International cricket
During South Africa's tour to India in 2010, Raina was called in the squad for the second test, but was not selected in the playing XI. He-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe as all the other first-choice players were rested from the tournament. India lost the first match under his captaincy against Zimbabwe by six wickets, but won the next match against Sri Lanka. Suresh Raina also captained the Indian Cricket team for the T-20 series against Zimbabwe in June 2010 and India won the 2 match series 2-0.He was the leading run scorer in this series. Virat Kohli and R Ashwin made their T-20 debuts in Raina's captaincy.He is one of the stylish batsman in India.He is 3rd t20 captain in India
2010 tour of Sri Lanka[ edit ]
Raina was then brought into the Test squad for the tour of Sri Lanka in July and August 2010. He made his debut in the Second Test after Yuvraj Singh was ill. Sri Lanka made 4/642 declared and India were in trouble at 4/241 when Raina came in to join Sachin Tendulkar . Raina went on to reach maiden century on debut becoming few of indian players to do so as the pair put on a double century partnership. Yuvraj recovered in time for the Third Test but the selectors opted to retain Raina. However, due to poor form throughout 2010 (apart from a half century against Australia at Mohali) and a failure to make any impact on the Centurion Test which South Africa won by an innings, he was dropped in favour of rookie Cheteshwar Pujara for the remainder of the series, in which India battled back to a 1–1 draw.
2011 Cricby walking during a high-profile match, the 2003 World Cup semi-final against Sri Lanka, after the umpire ruled him to be not out. [184] He has since proclaimed himself to be "a walker", or a batsman who will consistently walk, [185] and has done so on numerous occasions. [184] [186] On one occasion against Bangladesh , Gilchrist walked but TV replays failed to suggest any contact between his bat and the ball. Without such contact, he could not have been caught out. [186]
Gilchrist's actions have sparked debate amongst current and former players and umpires. [15] Ricky Ponting has declared on several occasions that he is not a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. [187] While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004 . [188] In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a "walking crusade" when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. [189] After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: "...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate...". [189] The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket . [189] Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had "zero support in the team" for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. [190] He added that he "felt isolated" and "silently accused of betraying the team. Implictly I was made to feel selfish, as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest." [190]
Gilchrist has been noted for his emotional outbursts on the cricket field, and has been fined multiple times for dissent against umpiring decisions. [191] [192] [193] In January 2006, he was fined 40% of his match fee in an ODI against South Africa. [191] [194] In another instance, in early 2004 in Sri Lanka , Gilchrist audibly argued with umpire Peter Manuel after batting partner Andrew Symonds was given out. [195] After the argument concluded, Manuel consulted umpiring partner Billy Bowden and reversed his decision, recalling Symonds to the crease. [196] Gilchrist was also reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board for publicly questioning the legality of Muttiah Muralitharan 's bowling action in 2002, [197] as his comments were found to be in breach of the clause in the player code of conduct relating to "detrimental public comment". [198]
During the 2003 World Cup, Gilchrist accused Pakistani wicketkeeper Rashid Latif of making a racist remark towards him while the latter was batting in their group match. Latif who was cleared by match referee Clive Lloyd , threatened to sue Gilchrist for this claim. [199]
Charity, media, business career and political work[ edit ]
Adam Gilchrist speaking at the 2013 National Flag Raising and Citizenship ceremony in Canberra
Outside cricket, Gilchrist is an ambassador for the charity World Vision in India, a country in which he is popular due to his cricketing achievements, [200] and sponsors a boy whose father has died. [201] He was approached in early 2005 by the US baseball franchise, the Boston Red Sox , with a view to him playing for them when his cricket career ended. [202] However, he was selected for the 2007 Cricket World Cup and announced his retirement from Test and One-Day cricket in early 2008. [203]
In March 2008, Gilchrist joined the Nine Network . [204] Gilchrist will appear as one of a panel of revolving co-hosts for the revived Wide World of Sports Weekend Edition . He made his debut on the program in March 2008, [204] and commentates on Nine's cricket coverage during the Australian summer. [204] In 2013 Gilchrist joined Ricky Ponting and various other names in cricket to commentate for Channel Ten in the third series of the Big Bash League . [205]
As Amway Australia Ambassador, Gilchrist has played a role in many of their charity events. In August 2010, he presented the Freedom Wheels program, an initiative to provide modified bikes to kids with disabilities, a cheque for $20,000. [206]
Gilchrist has been the chair of the National Australia Day Council since 2008. [207] In 2008, Gilchrist supported debate on whether Australia Day should be moved to a new date because the current date marks European settlement and is offensive to many Aboriginal Australians. [208] Gilchrist is considered to have left-wing views; Australian captain Ricky Ponting commented in his annual Captain's Diary that his deputy had a penchant for reading Karl Marx while on tour. [209]
Gilchrist has had a number of company directorships outside of cricket. His appointment to the board of ASX listed sandalwood company TFS Corporation, [210] committee member of Commonwealth Business Forum in Perth [211] and director of Travelex. [212] The appointment to TFS Corporation was not without controversy when as a board member of TFS he was named as a plaintiff suing his own TFS shareholders for defamation [213]
Autobiography[ edit ]
Gilchrist's autobiography True Colours, published in 2008, was the subject of much controversy. Gilchrist questioned the integrity of leading Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar in relation to the evidence he presented in the Monkeygate dispute, which was about allegations of racism against Harbhajan Singh . [214] [215] The autobiography said that Tendulkar told the first hearing that he could not hear what Harbhajan said to Andrew Symonds ; Gilchrist said he was "certain he [Tendulkar] was telling the truth" because he was "a fair way away". [214] [215] Gilchrist then questioned why Tendulkar then agreed with Harbhajan's claim at the second hearing that the exchange was an obscenity, and concluded that the process was "a joke". [215] He also raised questions over Tendulkar's sportsmanship and said he was "hard to find for a changing-room handshake after we have beaten India". [214] [216]
There was a backlash in India, which forced Gilchrist to clarify his position. Gilchrist later insisted that he did not accuse Tendulkar of lying in his testimony. He also denied calling the Indian a "bad sport" in regards to the handshake issue. [214] [217] Tendulkar responded by saying that "those remarks came from someone who doesn't know me enough. I think he made loose statements...I reminded him that I was the first person to shake hands after the Sydney defeat." [218] The autobiography also blamed the ICC for allowing Sri Lankan cricketer Muralitharan to bowl; Gilchrist believes that ICC changed the throwing law to legitimise a bowling action that he regards as illegitimate. The law change was described as "a load of horse crap. That's rubbish." [219] [220] Gilchrist claimed that Muralitharan threw the ball and alleged that the ICC protected him because Sri Lankan cricket authorities portrayed any criticism of the bowler's legitimacy as racism and a witchhunt conducted by whites. [220] [221] In response to these comments, former Sri Lankan captain Marvan Atapattu said that by questioning the credentials of players like Muralitharan and Tendulkar, Gilchrist had done no good to his own reputation.

Australian newspapers acknowledged "sledging" as a term in the mid-1970s. [3] [4] Despite the relatively recent coining of the term, the practice is as old as cricket itself, with historical accounts of witty banter between players being quite common. W. G. Grace and his brother E. M. were noted throughout their careers for being "noisy and boisterous" on the field. W. G. admitted that they used to "chaff" (i.e., tease) opponents, and this is seen as part of the gamesmanship for which E. M. and W. G. were always controversial. [5]
According to Ian Chappell , the use of "sledging" as a term originated at Adelaide Oval in either the 1963–1964 or 1964–1965 Sheffield Shield competition. Chappell claims that a cricketer who swore in the presence of a woman was said to have reacted to an incident "like a sledgehammer". As a result, the direction of insults or obscenities at opponents became known as "sledging". [6]
According to the BBC ’s Pat Murphy : “My understanding is that it came from the mid-sixties and a guy called Grahame Corling , who used to open the bowling for New South Wales and Australia … apparently the suggestion was that this guy's wife was [having an affair] with another team-mate, and when he came into bat [the fielding team] started singing When a Man Loves A Woman , the old Percy Sledge number.” [7]
"Ugly Australians"[ edit ]
The 1974–75 Australians were labelled the Ugly Australians for their hard-nosed cricket, verbal abuse and hostile fast bowling. "Behind the batsmen, Rod Marsh and his captain Ian Chappell would vie with each other in profanity", [8] and Tom Graveney wrote "It was an open secret that he used to encourage his players to give a lot of verbal abuse to rival batsman when they were at the wicket in an attempt to break their concentration." [9]
Viv Richards[ edit ]
West Indian batsman Viv Richards was notorious for punishing bowlers that dared to sledge him. So much so, that many opposing captains banned their players from the practice. However, in a county game against Glamorgan , Greg Thomas attempted to sledge him after he had played and missed at several balls in a row. He informed Richards: "It's red, round and weighs about five ounces, in case you were wondering." Richards hammered the next delivery out of the cricket grounds and into the nearby river Taff. Turning to the bowler, he commented: "Greg, you know what it looks like, now go and find it." [10]
Merv Hughes[ edit ]
Sledging is common at most levels of the game in Australia, but one Australian with a particular reputation for sledging was former fast bowler Merv Hughes . His intimidating and aggressive bowling style was often accompanied by a mixture of humorous witticisms, and vitriolic abuse. On occasions he crossed the line from sledging to insulting; however, there are numerous occasions of classic sledges delivered by Hughes.
One incident, as recalled by Hughes, was when he was bowling to Pakistan batsman Javed Miandad , who informed the overweight bowler that he "was too fat to play cricket" and that he "should be a bus driver". After being taunted for about five overs, Hughes decided to bowl around the wicket, and bowled a bouncer getting Javed caught at gully. As he was celebrating with his teammates, Hughes stuck his hand out in Javed's path, and yelled, "tickets please!". [11]
Harbhajan–Symonds incident (2007–08)[ edit ]
Sledging came into the media spotlight during the 2007–08 Indian tour of Australia when Harbhajan Singh was accused of alleged racial abuse towards Andrew Symonds , who is of Jamaican ancestry and the only 'black' player in the otherwise 'all-white' Australian team. [12] The allegation was not proved and a proposed three-match ban on Harbhajan was lifted. [13] He was instead charged with a Level 2.8 offence (abuse and insult not amounting to racism) to which he pleaded guilty and was fined 50 per cent of his match fees, although the Appeals Commissioner later noted that had he been aware of Harbhajan's prior record, a one-Test ban would have been issued.
2011 Cricket World Cup[ edit ]
Indian cricketer Sreesanth called the Australian captain, Ricky Ponting , a "loser" and even made a gesture (capital 'L') with his hands after Ponting was adjudged not out by the umpire. [14]
2013–14 Ashes series[ edit ]
During the 2013-14 Ashes , a stump microphone clearly caught Australian captain Michael Clarke telling England's Jimmy Anderson to "get ready for a broken fucking arm" during the first Test at The Gabba. Clarke was fined 20 per cent of his match fee by the ICC for the outburst. [15]

Early life[ edit ]
Taylor was born in Stoke-on-Trent , Staffordshire . He began cricketing early, keeping wicket in a car park next to Stoke City Football Club 's home ground, before playing for his schools Under-15 XI aged 12. He also was on the books of Port Vale F.C. as an apprentice, though he never played football professionally. [4] At 15 years he played for Bignall End Cricket Club in the North Staffs and South Cheshire League and for Staffordshire in the Minor Counties cricket league. On his debut he was confused for a spectator because of his youth. [5] He continued playing for Staffordshire from 1958 to 1960, whereupon he moved to Derbyshire and joined the Second XI of Derbyshire County Cricket Club . [6]
County stalwart[ edit ]
Taylor played in 639 first-class matches. His 1,649 dismissals (1,473 caught , 176 stumped ) in 639 games remains a first-class record. [2] With the bat, Taylor averaged only 16.92, and he is one of only two players to have passed 10,000 first-class runs without scoring a century though he subsequently scored exactly 100 against Yorkshire at Sheffield in 1981, his only first-class century. [7] He also took one first-class wicket as a bowler.
He played his debut first class match against South Africa on 1 June 1960, appearing as keeper for a Minor Counties XI. He scored 11 and a duck and did not take any catches behind the stumps. [8] Thanks largely to recommendations by Cliff Gladwin , [9] he went on to make his County Championship and Derbyshire debut on 7 June the follow year, scoring another duck and eight as well as taking two catches as Derbyshire drew with Sussex at the County Ground, Derby . [10] His first victim was Sussex's Ken Suttle , [2] yet several players observed that he had much to learn; many bowlers condemned him for standing up to the stumps and missing edges. [9] Taylor would go on to play 17 matches in his debut 1961 season for his county, scoring 20 runs at 11.38 with a best of 48, taking 47 catches and 6 stumpings behind the wicket. [11] 29 more games followed in 1960, however his batting remained unimpressive, scoring 300 runs at 10.71 with a best of 44. He remained dependable behind the stumps, with 77 catches and three stumpings. [11] His 77 catches set a new Derbyshire-record. [9] He notched his first half-century in the 1963 season, though averaged under 10.00. His 32 first-class games that season, what would be a career high, and a career-best season total of 81 catches behind the timbers. [11] This included all ten wickets in a match against Hampshire falling courtesy of his glove-work. [9]
The 1964 season was marked for Taylor's mid-season ankle injury. Though it occurred when he was playing football, he told his county that he had slipped on an escalator. According to Wisden the experience taught Taylor to be fastidious in his attention to physical fitness. [9] He nevertheless scored his second half-century and took 58 catches. [11] Nevertheless, Derbyshire considered dropping Taylor for Laurie Johnson , a more capable batsman. An effort with the pen from several Wisden contributors secured his reinstatement, however. [9]
Taylor's strong keeping continued to secure his place in the side, though despite a career best 719 runs in the 1966 season his batting struggled, with no half-centuries to add to his tally. [11] In 1967 his career was again put on hiatus through injury, when he edged a delivery into his own eye and suffered a detached retina which put him on his back for three weeks. [5] He nevertheless took another 63 catches from 23 appearances, but managed only 442 runs at 18.41. [11] His batting in the County Championship saw marginal improvement over the next two seasons, with a half century in 1968 and a career best 65 in 1969. [11] The 1969 season also saw Taylor make his first major forays into List-A cricket. He made 19 appearances that year, having made only seven others over the previous six. He only scored 180 runs, however he took 28 catches behind the stumps which would be a season best for the rest of his career. [12]
Over the winter of 1969, he was selected to tour Sri Lanka with the Marylebone Cricket Club . He played one match, on 20 February 1970, against Ceylon at Colombo . He scored 7 and 19*, and stumped Anura Tennekoon as the MCC moved to a convincing victory. [13] Taylor returned to England for the 1970 county season, continuing his good form behind the stumps with 21 List-A and 51 Championship catches. He also snared 11 stumping victims, a career best. [11] [12] He toured with the MCC over the winter in Australia , with 16 more victims from four matches though his batting disappointed, with 94 runs at only 18.80. [11]
New Zealand Test debut[ edit ]
With his experience with the MCC, and his county success behind the stumps, Taylor had been coming to the notice of England captain Ray Illingworth . Though Knott was incumbent, Illingworth rewarded Taylor's patience with a Test cap. [7] Taylor made his Test debut against New Zealand at Christchurch on 25 February 1971. In an eight-wicket England victory, he took two catches and a stumping, but scored only four runs before being stumped by his opposite number. [14] His quiet debut escaped any reference in Wisden‍ '​s match report. [15] He did not play another match on the tour, and would not play another Test for six more years. [16]
County interim[ edit ]
There are about 300 county cricketers and we can't all play for England. Cricket has taken me to many places I would not otherwise have seen and I'm grateful for that. I am a pro and try to behave like one, but I will admit that I don't enjoy people coming up to me on tour and asking who I am. That's when it really hurts. [9]
– Taylor, having been awarded Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1977, unaware that he would be returning to Test cricket that winter.
Taylor instead returned to England for the 1971 season, improving with the bat and scoring 619 runs at 24.76, with three half-centuries and a best of 74*. He secured another 68 victims from behind the stumps across all matches. [11] [12] Over the winter of 1971/72, he was selected for the World Test XI tour of Australia, playing seven four-day matches under captain Rohan Kanhai . He took 21 catches, performed three stumpings and although he only scored 128 runs at 16.00 this including a half century against Western Australia on 4 December. [17] [18] He returned to England for the summer of 1972, scoring another half century and snaring fifty batsmen from behind the stumps in the County Championship, [11] and a further 23 in the one day arena. [12] A further 77 batsmen fell to Taylor in 1973, [11] [12] and he earned a place on the MCC winter tour of the West Indies . Although not being selected for the Test series over the incumbent Knott, he scored 65 against Jamaica on 9 February, outscoring Knott's five. In doing so, he passed 6,500 first class runs in his career. [19]
Taylor became a regular back-up keeper for Knott on England's winter tours. After a solid 1974 season with another County Championship half century and 86 victims with the gloves, [11] [12] he toured New Zealand with the England national side, and following 111 more wickets in 1975 toured South Africa with the International Wanderers under Greg Chappell . [11] [12] On facing a South African Invitation XI in Johannesburg on 2 April Taylor, batting in the second innings, scored a career best 97 before being dismissed by Howard Bergins . [20] Over 1976 and 1977, he took 164 more dismissals, and scored 910 runs including another half-century. [11] [12] He was selected as Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1977, along with Mike Brearley , Gordon Greenidge , Michael Holding and Viv Richards . [9]
Return to Tests[ edit ]
Knott, the incumbent keeper for England, turned to World Series Cricket in 1977 on the encouragement of Tony Greig and was thus banned from Test cricket. [21] Taylor was the next in line to take up the gloves, and returned to Test cricket on 14 December 1977 against Pakistan at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore . Although there had been three first-class warm-up fixtures, Taylor had not impressed with the bat and had been rotated out of the second game in order for Paul Downton to have a chance at the gloves. Taylor nevertheless got the nod for the first Test. [22] Captained by fellow Wisden Cricketers of the Year Brearley, he took two catches and a stumping, and score a lengthy 32 from 158 deliveries supporting Geoff Miller who was eventually stranded on 98. [23] He played in the following two Tests of the series, and though keeping tidily he was dismissed for a first ball duck - a score of zero - in the second Test, [24] though improved with a slow (and then career best) 36 from 200 balls and 18 not out in the third match. [25] He also played in the 2nd and 3rd One Day International fixtures. [26] He remained the incumbent gloveman for the New Zealand leg of the tour, appearing in two warm up games and three Tests. He took four catches in the first, all from the bowling of Chris Old , and scored a career-best 45 in the second. [27] His 236 runs across the entire tour came at 21.45, and he took 20 catches and a stumping. [28]
Taylor returned to the County Championship for three matches before the home Pakistan Test series. [27] Taylor played in all three Tests, keeping well with eight catches but batting poorly, with 12 runs at only 6.00. [29] Although he took five catches and three stumpings in the ODI series, he batted only once and did not score. [30] He only had two more County Championship appearances before the home Test series against New Zealand on 27 July, where despite 12 catches and a stumping he again averaged low with the bat - 31 runs at 10.33. [31] Nevertheless, he retained his place in the team.
1978/79 Ashes series[ edit ]
Main article: English cricket team in Australia in 1978–79
The Adelaide Oval , scene of Taylor's career-best 97.
Taylor joined the England team for the winter Ashes series of 1978/79, commencing the tour by facing South Australia on 3 November 1978. Though it was a quiet game with the bat, Taylor was in strong form behind the stumps - collecting eight victims though the tourists went on to lose the match. [32] Facing New South Wales on 17 November, Taylor hit a forgettable nine, however four more scalps came, two of them from what was becoming a prolific partnership, both for England and Derbyshire, with Geoff Miller. [33] [34]
England went into the first Test on 1 December with mixed success in the warm up matches behind them. Australia batted first, however with wickets for Bob Willis , Old and Ian Botham , and five catches for Taylor, they were removed for only 116. Taylor, batting at number four, scored 20 runs as England replied with 286, however the tourists bowling success would not strike twice as Australia reached 339 to save the game, and Taylor was quiet behind the stumps that innings. England could only reach 170/3 by the end of play. [35]
England, however, took a 166 run victory in the second Test, commencing on 25 December at the WACA . Taylor made only 14 runs, but he held onto six catches for England's potent bowling attack. [36] Australia replied with a 103-run victory in the third Test, and Taylor was quiet both with the gloves and the bat. [37] The fourth Test was equally unspectacular for Taylor, though England took a series-lead with a 93-run victory. [38]
On 27 January 1979, Geoffrey Boycott and Brearley walked out to bat at the Adelaide Oval for the fifth Test, having been put in by Australia. The tourists were routed for 169 all out with Taylor only making four runs. He partnered with Botham to take two catches as Australia were, in return, routed for 164. England, needing to set a commanding total, reached 267/7 when Taylor walked out to bat with his fellow Derbyshire colleague Miller. Miller went on to make 64 before he was dismissed and John Emburey came to the crease, however by the Time Taylor was sent back England had reached 336/8, Taylor having scored 97 runs from 300 balls. He passed his previous Test best of 45, and with his 97th run he both equalled his first-class best and reached 9,500 first-class runs. His dismissal was to a "tiny leg-side tickle" though, despite being three from a hundred, he chose to walk off the field. John Thicknesse in 2004 wrote that "it said everything about his sportsmanship." [7] Though Taylor took no catches in the final innings, Willis and Mike Hendrick combined to reduce Australia to 160 all out and give England victory. [39] Taylor made 36 in the final Test match, three catches and a stumping as England took a convincing nine-wicket victory to seal the series. [40] Taylor's 208 runs at 26.00 outscored captain Brearley, and he ended the Test series with 18 catches and two stumpings. [41]
Taylor played a one-day warm up match against Tasmania , however his ODI place was taken by David Bairstow . [42]
1979 World Cup[ edit ]
Taylor returned to England to make several Benson and Hedges Cup and John Player League List-A appearances, and resumed his capable keeping for Derbyshire in the County Championship - in a match against Leicestershire on 2 May he took four catches and performed two stumpings. [43] In June, the 1979 Cricket World Cup commenced in England, and Taylor was selected as keeper for the tournament which consisted of 60 overs per innings. England were seen as good prospects for the tournament, having won five of their previous six Tests thanks, according to Wisden, to "the bowlers, Bob Taylor's skilful wicket-keeping, and the all-round excellence of Ian Botham." [44] 9 June saw the opening match of Group A, where England faced Australia at Lord's . Taylor took one catch, but was not called on to bat as the hosts won by six wickets. [45] Nor was he required to bat on 13 June when, in a two-day game where England demolished Canada for 45 all out and won by eight wickets. [46] Against Pakistan on 16 June at Headingley he scored 20 from 59 balls and took two catches as England won by a narrower margin of 14 runs. [47]
England thus reached the semi-finals, and faced New Zealand at Old Trafford on 20 June. Taylor, batting at nine, scored 12 runs from 25 before he was run out , and New Zealand fell to 212 chasing 221. [48] The final took place at Lord's on 23 June against the West Indies . The host team - minus an injured Willis - put the West Indies into bat, however a century from Viv Richards took them to 286/9 - with Taylor taking one catch. Despite an opening partnership of 129 between Brearley and Boycott, England fell 92 runs short at 194 all out. Taylor, batting at ten, was dismissed for a first-ball duck from Joel Garner before Hendrick was bowled by Colin Croft to seal the West Indies' victory. [49] Taylor's returns were modest, scoring only 32 runs at 16.00 with a best of 20*, and taking four catches but no stumpings. [50]
Taylor returned to Derbyshire, who had reached the Semi-Final of the Benson and Hedges Cup, however despite taking two catches and scoring eight runs, Surrey took a six-run victory and knocked Derbyshire out of the competition. [51] On 12 July, Taylor was back with the England team for three Tests against India, where he proved himself more formidable with the bat - with a knock of 64 inflating his average to 32.50. [52]
Australia 1979/80, 1981[ edit ]
From August 1979 to November 1981, Taylor and England would play Australia in two Ashes series, with one other Test against India. Taylor acquitted himself well over the winter tour of Australia and India, scoring 145 runs from four matches at 20.71, and his polished glovework took 20 catches and performed one stumping. [53] [54] On 15 February 1980, during the only Test against India in Bombay to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Taylor took seven catches in India's first innings, and three more in the second, all but two off the bowling of Botham. England won convincingly by ten wickets. [55] His ten wickets for the match set a new world Test record. Taylor's 43 runs with the bat set a partnership of 171 runs with Botham, also a record sixth-wicket partnership for England against India. This included Taylor begin dismissed leg before wicket only to protest the decision and have his reservations supported by the Indian captain Gundappa Viswanath . [56]
Taylor returned for the 1980 County Championship in England, and although he scored only 238 runs at 14.87 from 20 appearances he took 34 catches and performed seven stumpings, [57] Derbyshire camp joint ninth that season. [58]
On 10 June 1981, the touring Australian side faced Derbyshire in Derby in a three-day drawn match. Taylor had as quiet game. remaining five not out and not taking part in any wickets. [59] On 17 June, however, during a county Championship match against Yorkshire , Taylor hit the only century of his career. Having taken two catches and performed two stumpings in Yorkshire's first innings of 374, he helped Derbyshire reach 480 with an innings of exactly 100 before being caught and bowled by Phil Carrick . The match was drawn before the third innings could begin. [60]
Taylor again missed out on a place in the ODI team for the Prudential Trophy against Australia, with Geoff Humpage making the only three international appearances of his career. Paul Downton also took his place for the first Test of the 1981 Ashes series , where Australia took a four-wicket victory. [61] Taylor was on the pitch for the 2nd Test, however, and despite scores of zero and nine took four catches as the match was drawn. [62] In the third Test at Headingley, Taylor took seven catches though was outshone by Botham's all-round performance in England's 18-run victory. [63] Two catches and eight runs came in England's 29 run win at Edgbaston on 30 July. [64]
Before the fifth Test, however, Knott - having returned from the Packer series and been admitted back into the Test fold, was awarded Taylor's place for the final two Tests. Taylor, his 1981 Ashes series truncated, finished with only 23 runs at a dire 3.83 average - the lowest of the entire England team including specialist bowlers. His keeping has netted him 13 catches, however. Knott, selected for his superior batting skills, scored 178 runs from his two Test matches at 59.33. [65] Taylor instead returned to Derbyshire, and ended his season with 231 runs at 19.25, including his maiden century, 33 catches and 12 stumpings. [66]
Final years[ edit ]
Taylor toured India and Sri Lanka over the winter of 1981/82, playing in seven Test matches. Though his keeping accounted for 19 batsmen, he scored only 88 runs over eight innings at 14.66. [67] He kept for only two of the ODI matches, with Jack Richards taking the gloves from him for the rest. After a brief return to Derbyshire for the County Championship in May, [27] he was again in the Test squad for the home series against India, taking nine catches but again a low 12.00 runs per innings from the three matches. [68] Pakistan swiftly followed, and Taylor made 54 in England's second innings of the first Test at Edgbaston on 29 July, [69]
On 22 October he commenced his 1982/83 tour of Australia by passing 11,000 first class runs in a match against Queensland , [70] before keeping wicket for all five Tests. Though he scored only 135 runs at 19.28, he took another 13 catches. He again missed out on the one day position, however, this time to Ian Gould . [26] Upon his return he played several matches for Derbyshire in the County Championship. His batting would continue to struggle, only 267 runs at 17.80, though he kept tidily with 37 catches and two stumpings through the season. Commencing in mid-July, he also took part in a four-Test home series against New Zealand, taking 11 catches but failing to make an impression with the bat - 63 runs at 10.50. [71] He returned to New Zealand that winter, and then on to Pakistan, though despite keeping well he failed to score more than 83 runs at 9.22. [72] He featured in all three ODI matches, however, taking two catches but scoring only 10 runs at 5.00 per innings. [73] His batting was consistently below par despite his keeping ability, [7] and the third test against Pakistan on 19 March 1984 at Lahore was to be his last. It was a quiet game for him, scoring only one and five, and taking one catch in a drawn fixture. [74]
Taylor played a full stint in the 1984 County Championship, playing 18 matches and scoring 303 runs at 20.20, as well as taking 32 victims with the gloves. [75] Derbyshire could only manage twelfth. [76] Taylor fared well with the gloves in the one day tournaments also, taking 10 catches in the Benson and Hedges Cup, [77] and eight more in the John Player Special League. [78]
On 8 September Taylor commenced his final four days playing for Derbyshire's First XI. On that day, his last County Championship match began against Hampshire. No play took place on the following day, 9 September, to allow the John Player Special League match between the two counties, where Taylor look two catches but was not called on to bat. [79] Following this game, on 10 September, the County Championship resumed with Hampshire on 535/4, Taylor having taken one catch to remove Trevor Jesty from the bowling of Ole Mortensen . Derbyshire declared without losing another wicket, and Derbyshire reached 322/3 declared without Taylor having to bat thanks to centuries from Kim Barnett and Bill Fowler . Taylor completed a stumping from Miller to restrict Hampshire to 245/8, and Derbyshire chased down the final total for a five-wicket victory without Taylor needed to come out of the pavilion. [80] He then retired. [81]
This would not be Taylor's last outing with the club, however. He captained Derbyshire Second XI in 1985 for eight games, though he did not keep wicket. Batting last in the order, he was rarely called on to bat. [82] During New Zealand's 1986 Test match at Lord's, Taylor was present in the hospitality tent when Bruce French was injured by a Richard Hadlee delivery. After trailing Bill Athey behind the wicket, New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney permitted Taylor to come on the field to keep for the remainder of the day. Wisden recorded "[Taylor] equipped himself with an assortment of borrowed kit, although he did, far-sightedly, have his own gloves in his car... Despite having retired from first-class cricket two years earlier, Taylor ... kept without a blemish." Bobby Parks was brought in to keep for the following day. [81] Also in 1986, Taylor was selected as part of Brian Close 's invitational XI to play New Zealand at Scarborough on 31 August. Taylor kept wicket, and scored 21 as well as taking two catches. [83] He was part of Michael Parkinson 's World XI in 1988, playing against the MCC where Taylor again kept wicket and scored four runs. [84]
Style and equipment[ edit ]
Taylor's wicket keeping abilities have been oft praised. In his citation for Cricketer of the Year for 1977, Wisden noted that "artistry - there is no other word for it - behind the stumps has long illumined even the darkest hours of Derbyshire cricket." He was known both for his acrobatic fielding behind the stumps, and his diligence and stamina, "he has been without peer in the world for some years and would clearly have graced the England team but for Alan Knott." He was noted for standing up to the stumps on nearly all occasions, stating that "Any decent slip catcher could do it standing back." [5] By keeping his weight forwards and planted on his left foot, he was a skilled leg side stumper – considered a difficult skill in wicket keeping. [85]
Taylor was careful with his fitness, following an ankle injury in 1964 kept him from the first seven games of the season. [5] Taylor wore two pairs of thin Chamois inners and Mitre wicket-keeping gloves from which he cut away all the padding from inside the palms and removed the webbing. His reasoning for this was that he liked to feel the ball in his palm and if taking the ball correctly most of the time the bruising wasn't too troublesome. This can be contrasted with Knott who preferred plenty of padding on his palms. [86]
Taylor was a popular member of the England and Derbyshire squads, his nickname "Chat" deriving from his willingness to talk to his team-mates and listen to their problems. [7] Himself a mediocre batsmen but skilled keeper, Taylor has continued to advocate the picking of capable wicket-keepers over those with lesser ability behind the stumps but greater talent with the bat. He has been vocal over English selection policies since retirement, particularly those of Geraint Jones , Chris Read and Matt Prior . [87]

An Australian fielder runs to take a catch
New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond about to dismiss Mohammad Yousuf caught and bowled
Caught is a method of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket . Being caught out is the most common method of dismissal at higher levels of competition. This method of dismissal is covered by Law 32 of the Laws of cricket which reads: [1]
A batsman is out caught if a fielder catches the ball fully within the field of play without it bouncing once the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat. If a batsman could be given out caught or by any other method except bowled , 'caught' takes precedence.
This means that the batsman cannot be out caught if:
The ball is called a no ball or dead ball .
The batsman does not hit the ball with his bat or the gloved hand holding the bat.
The ball, having been hit, makes contact with the field before a fielder catches the ball.
The ball does not remain under the control of the fielder.
The ball is hit and lands beyond the boundary ; ( six runs ).
A fielder taking the catch makes contact with the boundary rope or the area outside the boundary.
The ball hits a close in fielder on the helmet, and rebounds in the air for a catch.
If a batsman is out caught, any runs scored off that delivery are voided. If the catch is taken by the wicket-keeper , then informally it is known as a "caught behind". A catch by the bowler is known as a "caught and bowled". This has nothing to do with the dismissal bowled but is rather a shorthand for saying the catcher and bowler are the same player (the scorecard annotation is usually c. and b. or c&b followed by the bowler's name).
If the catch taken is pronounced or obvious, the players need not appeal to the umpire; the batsman normally chooses to acknowledge the dismissal himself. However, in the event that the ball brushes the edge of the bat, or the catch is taken very close to the ground, or the ball appears to have bounced off the batsman's foot (so it has not touched the ground), or the ball appearing to come off the bat very close to the pitch surface (bump ball), or if the batsman is reluctant to accept that he has been dismissed, the fielding team has to appeal to the umpire for this decision. In international competition, if neither field umpire can clearly decide if a catch has been made or not, they may refer to the third (television) umpire for a review. The third umpire may also be used if the Umpire Decision Review System is available and a team wishes to dispute a call concerning a possible catch.
If a batsman is caught, the bowler is credited with the batsman's wicket and the catching fielder is credited for the dismissal. If the two batsmen cross each other, in attempting to take a run, before the catch was taken, the non-striking batsman at the time remains at the opposite end of the pitch as the new incoming batsman comes to the crease at his former end. This means, unless it is now a new over, he is now on strike and the incoming batsman is not.
Celebration[ edit ]
Before 2000, the Laws of Cricket defined a catch as being completed when the player had "complete control over the further disposal of the ball". In the very strictest sense, this meant that the player did not finish catching the ball until he threw it away, though the player doesn't have to throw the ball to anyone in particular in so doing.
For this reason, even today many cricketers celebrate a catch by lobbing the ball into the air. In a Super Sixes match in the 1999 Cricket World Cup , South African Herschelle Gibbs caught Australian captain Steve Waugh but Waugh was given not out when Gibbs was ruled to not have control of the ball when attempting to throw the ball in celebration. [2] Waugh went on to score a match-winning 120 not out [3] to qualify his team for the semi-finals; Australia went on to win the tournament.



Also, losing a T20 without losing a wicket, biggest difference between scores in an innings, keepers without dismissals, and bowlers without wickets

The 1959-60 Dacca Test was one of the rare occasions when the captains, Fazal Mahmood and Richie Benaud, took six or more wickets each © Associated Press
Has anyone ever lost an international match without losing a wicket when batting second? asked Gautham Kamath from India
This unusual situation has only happened once - batting first or second - and even then the weather was the real culprit. In a T20 international in Johannesburg in March 2012, India were 71 for 0, chasing South Africa's 219 for 4, when rain forced the players off after 7.5 overs. They couldn't get back on, and India were behind the Duckworth-Lewis target score of 83 at the time, so South Africa were declared the winners. There have been six further matches - two ODIs and four T20s - in which the unsuccessful side lost only one wicket. Two of those involved the team batting second - Zimbabwe (29 for 1, chasing 44 in five overs) against Sri Lanka in Providence in the 2010 World Twenty20, and Bangladesh (179 for 1) against West Indies (197 for 4) in an uninterrupted T20 in Mirpur in December 2012.
Is Darren Sammy the only Test cricketer from St Lucia? asked Alex Nweke from Nigeria
Darren Sammy , who recently announced his retirement from Test cricket after being relieved of the captaincy, remains the only man from St Lucia to play in a Test match. However, two other men from this tiny but picturesque island have played international cricket for West Indies: the hard-hitting opener (and occasional wicketkeeper) Johnson Charles has played 30 one-day internationals (scoring two hundreds) and 21 T20 internationals so far, while slow left-armer Garey Mathurin played three T20 internationals in 2011 and 2012.
How many times have both captains have taken ten wickets or more in a Test match? asked Siddhartha from India
That's a nice simple one: there has never been a Test in which both captains took ten wickets. Indeed, such is the paucity of bowling captains that there have only been 17 occasions in all where a skipper has taken ten or more wickets in a Test, four of those by Imran Khan and two by another Pakistani, Intikhab Alam. The last one was by Shaun Pollock, with 10 for 147 for South Africa against India in Bloemfontein in November 2001. There have only been two instances of rival captains taking six or more wickets in the same Test: by Fazal Mahmood for Pakistan (6 for 123) and Australia's Richie Benaud (8 for 111) in Dacca in 1959-60, and England's Bob Willis (6 for 131) and Imran Khan of Pakistan (8 for 115) at Headingley in 1982.
When Brian Lara scored his 501, the next-highest score was 116. Is that the biggest difference between two scores in the same innings? asked James Wallace from England
Brian Lara's 501 not out for Warwickshire against Durham at Edgbaston in 1994 broke the individual first-class record of 499, set by Hanif Mohammad for Karachi in 1958-59. But one of Hanif's marks from that match against Bahawalpur in Karachi in 1958-59 remained intact: the next-highest score in that innings was Wallis Mathias' 103, a difference of 396 runs (to the 385 between Lara and Keith Piper). There are six other instances of a difference of 300 or more between the top scorer and the second-highest, the sixth of which is the Test record - set by Lara again, during his 375 for West Indies against England in St John 's in 1993-94, when the next-highest score was Shivnarine Chanderpaul's 75 not out.
Who's the only wicketkeeper never to make a dismissal in a Test? asked Surinder Patnaik from Delhi
The holder of the melancholy record as the only designated wicketkeeper to play Test cricket but not make a dismissal is Humayun Farhat , of Pakistan, who failed to get on the scorecard in his only match, in Hamilton in March 2001: New Zealand lost only four wickets in winning by an innings. Humayun's brother, the batsman Imran Farhat, had made his debut in the first match of that same series: he has now won 40 caps. Seven other keepers failed to take any catches in their Test careers, but did pull off a stumping - including the unfortunate Vijay Rajindernath , who made four stumpings on his debut for India, against Pakistan in Mumbai in November 1952... and never played again.
Who has bowled in the most Test innings without taking a wicket? asked Jeremy Larkham from England
I wasn't quite sure what you meant here - the most innings bowled in without ever taking a wicket, or the most wicketless ones by someone who did strike elsewhere. Assuming it's the second of these, the answer is Sachin Tendulkar, who turned his arm over in 112 Test innings in which he didn't take a wicket (although he did manage 46 in all). A rather more celebrated bowler, Jacques Kallis - who finished with 292 wickets - bowled in 106 innings in which he failed to strike. Steve Waugh (98), Sanath Jayasuriya (88) and Mark Waugh (86) come next. Of bowlers who never took a Test wicket at all, the Indian opening batsman Krishnamachari Srikkanth bowled in 16 different innings without any luck, and George Headley of West Indies in 14. The Lancashire allrounder Len Hopwood holds the record for the most balls bowled in Tests without getting a wicket - 462 - but he played in only two Tests, both in the 1934 Ashes series. Headley (398 fruitless deliveries) is second on this list too.
And there's an update to the recent question about Derek Underwood's long-awaited maiden century, from Mike Slattery from Ireland
"Further to the reference to Derek Underwood's maiden - and indeed only - first-class hundred in Hastings in 1984: in the very same innings, the Australian Test bowler Terry Alderman made his maiden - and only - first-class half-century. It seems remarkable that both managed their achievements in a match in which all 40 wickets were taken at an average of 16.75; their partnership of 53 for the ninth wicket was the second-highest of the match. It was quite a game for personal achievements: Colin Wells top-scored with half-centuries in both Sussex innings, and also took a five-for. All this, and it ended in a tie!"

dates, either because of the first main contributor rule or close national ties (see MOSNUM ), are systematically tagged with {{Use dmy dates}} over time. The template is invisible except in edit mode.
The template is useful to the editors to quickly know which date format is to be used when adding new dates into an article. It also facilitates article maintenance by enabling bots to recognise use of this format, and by adding the article to the hidden category Use dmy dates .
Use of this template is part of a continuing effort to monitor the date formats used in articles, to assist in maintaining consistent formatting within an article. It is not a temporary "cleanup" template. Therefore, do not remove the template without valid reason, such as a determination the article uses or should use a different date format.
After being tagged, and bearing in mind article evolution, periodic script or bot runs clean up formats, correcting any new introductions since its last visit, and updating the visit date on the {{Use dmy dates}} template.
The dmy and mdy templates have almost always been used to indicate date styles in the body of the articles; although it may also indicate the flavour of dates in reference sections or parts thereof. Therefore, this template notice ought to be read in conjunction with the blurb at Wikipedia:Date formattings . MOSNUM script documentation may also be relevant to those interested.
In general, the date format used for publication dates within references should match that used within the article body. However, it is common practice for archive and access dates to use the alternative ymd format. This usage is valid and is specifically mentioned at MOSDATE . In those cases, the archive and access date formats should not be altered when fixing dates.

Usage
{{ Football squad }} is designed to be used within squad list templates (typically placed at the bottom of a player page) in order to make editing and standardisation easier. If you want to use this template first set up a new template for your squad, typically called something like Template:(team name) squad.
Templates useful for formatting the list are:
{{football squad2 player}} - takes parameters "no" (number) and "name" (player name).
{{ football squad manager }} - takes the parameter "name" (manager name) and the optional parameter "title" (defaults to Manager, other commonly assigned values are Coach and Head Coach). Has no bullet mark afterward, use only as the last entry on a list.
Options
teamdisplay: Use this parameter when you want the name displayed on the top line of the box to be different than the full title of the article about the team; for example, where the article title is qualified to disambiguate between two similarly-named teams. See {{ Olimpija Ljubljana squad }} for an example of usage.
{{football squad | name = {{subst:PAGENAME}} | teamname = Norwich City F.C. | bgcolor = yellow | textcolor = green | bordercolor = green | list =  {{football squad2 player|no=1|name=[[Robert Green|Green]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=2|name=[[Matthieu Louis-Jean|Louis-Jean]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=3|name=[[Adam Drury (footballer, born 1978)|Drury]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=4|name=[[Jason Shackell|Shackell]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=5|name=[[Craig Fleming|Fleming]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=6|name=[[Darren Huckerby|Huckerby]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=8|name=[[Peter Thorne (footballer)|Thorne]]}} {{football squad2 player|no=10|name=[[Robert Earnshaw|Earnshaw]]}} {{football squad manager|name=[[Glenn Roeder|Roeder]]}} }}

While a company, CricInfo Ltd, was formed in 1996, CricInfo remained a volunteer-run operation until late 1999 and was not fully staffed until late 2000. The site was reliant on contributions from fans around the world who spent hours compiling electronic scorecards and contributing them to CricInfo's comprehensive archive, as well as keying in live scores from games around the world using CricInfo's scoring software, "dougie". [6] [7] In 2006, Cricinfo's estimated worth was $150 million. [8]
Cricinfo's significant growth in the 1990s made it an attractive site for investors during the peak of the dotcom boom , and in 2000 it received $37 million worth of Satyam Infoway Ltd. shares in exchange for a 25% stake in the company (a valuation of around £100 million). It used around $22m worth of the paper to pay off initial investors but only raised about £6 million by selling the remaining stock. While the site continued to attract more and more users and operated on a very low cost base, its income was not enough to support a peak staff of 130 in nine countries, forcing redundancies .
By late 2002 the company was making a monthly operating profit and was one of very few independent sports sites to avoid collapse (such as Sports.com and Sportal ). However, the business was still servicing a large loan. Cricinfo was eventually acquired by the Paul Getty 's Wisden Group , the publisher of the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and The Wisden Cricketer , and renamed Wisden Cricinfo. The Wisden brand (and its own wisden.com site) were eventually phased out in favor of Cricinfo for Wisden's online operations. In December 2005, Wisden re-launched its recently discontinued Wisden Asia Cricket magazine as Cricinfo Magazine, a magazine dedicated to coverage of Indian cricket. The magazine published its last issue in July 2007.
In 2007, the Wisden Group began to be broken up and sold to other companies; BSkyB acquired The Wisden Cricketer, while Sony Corporation acquired the Hawk-Eye ball tracking system. [9] In June 2007, ESPN Inc. announced that it had acquired Cricinfo from the Wisden Group. [10] The acquisition was intended to help further expand Cricinfo by combining the site with ESPN's other web properties, including ESPN.com and ESPN Soccernet . Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. [11]
Sambit Bal is currently the Editor-in-Chief of ESPNCricinfo. In 2013, EspnCricinfo.com celebrated 20 years of the property with a series of online features. The annual ESPNCricinfo Awards have also become an extremely popular event in the cricket calendar.
Popularity[ edit ]
ESPNcricinfo's popularity was further demonstrated on 24 February 2010, when the site could not handle the heavy traffic experienced after notable Indian player Sachin Tendulkar broke the record for the highest individual score in a One Day International match with 200*. [12] [13]
Features[ edit ]
ESPNcricinfo contains various news , columns , blogs , videos and fantasy sports games. Among its most popular feature are its liveblogs of cricket matches, which includes a bevy of scorecard options, allowing readers to track such aspects of the game as wagon wheels and partnership breakdowns. For each major cricket match, the live scores are accompanied by a Bulletin, which details the turning points of the match and some of the off-field events. The site also used to offer Cricinfo 3D, a feature which utilizes a match's scoring data to generate a 3D animated simulation of a live match. [14]
Regular columns on ESPNcricinfo include "All Today's Yesterdays", an "On this day" column focusing on historical cricket events, and "Quote Unquote", which features notable quotes from cricketers and cricket administrators.
Among its most extensive feature is StatsGuru, a database originally created by Travis Basevi, containing statistics on players, officials, teams, information about cricket boards, details of future tournaments, individual teams, and records.

(born 1 April 1965 in Punjab , India ) is a former Indian cricketer . He played domestic cricket for Punjab and played two One Day Internationals for India in 1994.
Bhupinder Singh is currently a member of selection committee , a post to which he was nominated in 2005, [3] and which he retained in 2006. [4]
Bhupinder Singh is also an administrator in the Punjab Cricket Association .



a shot that reaches the boundary after touching the ground, which scores four runs to the batting side.
Four wickets (also 4WI)
four or more wickets taken by a bowler in an innings, considered a good performance. Mostly used in One Day Internationals .
Fourth stump
a position or line one stump's width outside the off stump, i.e. where the wicket's fourth stump would be positioned if it existed. Generally used to describe the line or pitch of a delivery. A fourth stump line is roughly synonymous with the corridor of uncertainty. [25]
Free hit
a penalty given in some forms of cricket when a bowler bowls a front foot no-ball. The bowler must bowl another delivery, and the batsman cannot be dismissed by the bowler from that delivery. Between the no-ball and the free hit, the fielders may not change positions (unless the batsmen changed ends on the no-ball).
an informal form of the game. The term "playing French Cricket" can mean that a batsman has not moved his feet and looks ungainly because of this.
French Cut (also Chinese Cut, Surrey Cut, or Harrow Drive)
terms for any poorly executed shot which results in an inside edge which narrowly misses hitting the stumps. [17]
Fritz
To be out stumped following a rebound from the wicketkeeper's pads on to the stumps.
Front foot
in a batsman's stance the front foot is the foot that is nearer to the bowler. A bowler's front foot is the last foot to contact the ground before the ball is released.
is the position of the bowler at the moment when his front foot lands on the ground just prior to delivering the ball.
Front-foot shot
a shot played with the batsman's weight on his front foot (i.e. the foot nearest the bowler).
Fruit Salad
when a bowler delivers a different type of delivery each time, rather than bowling a constant speed, length and angle. Fruit salad bowling is used most commonly in Twenty20 to prevent batsmen from getting comfortable.
Full length
a delivery that pitches closer to the batsman than a ball pitching on a good length, but further away than a half-volley.
Full toss (also full bunger)
a delivery that reaches the batsman on the full, i.e. without bouncing. Usually considered a bad delivery to bowl as the batsman has a lot of time to see the ball and play an attacking shot. Also, it does not have a chance to change direction off the ground, making it the ultimate crime for a spin or seam bowler. [1] [3]
Furniture
G[ edit ]
Gardening
a batsman prodding at the pitch with his bat between deliveries, either to flatten a bump in the pitch, to soothe his own frazzled nerves or simply to waste time or upset the rhythm of the bowler. Considered facetious as there is not really a point to it. [1] [3]
Getting one's eye in
when the batsman takes his time to assess the condition of the pitch, ball or weather etc before starting to attempt more potentially risky strokes.
Given man
given men were players in the early history of cricket who did not normally play for a particular side but were included, for a particular fixture, to strengthen it. Early first-class matches were usually the subject of big wagers and it was therefore desirable that the two sides should be perceived as being of roughly equal strength. The concept is similar to that of handicapping in modern-day horse racing, whereby horses carry different weights in an attempt to equalise their chances of winning, again to encourage betting.
Glance
the shot played very fine behind the batsman on the leg side. A glance is typically played on a short-pitched ball. [8] See also flick.
Glove
part of a batsman's kit worn to protect the hands from accidental injury. When a hand is in contact with the bat it is considered part of the bat and so a player can be given out caught to a ball that came off the glovedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , a non-profit organization.

This template adds a category or dated category to a page.
It will add the page to an optional additional category.
If the dated category is invalid it will add the page to Category:Articles with invalid date parameter in template
Syntax
Parameter 1: Default category name (without
Category
) - the category if there is no date, but also the stem of the category name when there is a date..
Parameter 2: Preposition (from, since, in, as of).
Parameter 3: Date (month year, e.g. November 2015. Usually the "date" parameter of the calling template
{{{date|}}}
.
Parameter 4: Category all the articles go in, dated or not (if there is one).
Parameter 5: Alternative default category, used when parameter 1 is right for forming the dated category, but the undated items need to go somewhere else.
Technical
The parameter onlyarticles ({{ Dated maintenance category }} only) is used for template design, restricting the function of this template to article namespace (as in {{DMCA}} ).
Examples
{{DMCFACT|Wikipedia articles that are too technical|from|{{{date|}}}}}
will categorise all files, articles, categories and templates in Category:Wikipedia articles that are too technical from October 2015 , if the date is set October 2015 e.g. If such a category does not exist, or the date was set incorrectly, this template will also add the article to Category:Articles with invalid date parameter in template .
{{DMCAT|Wikipedia articles that are too technical|from|{{{date|}}}}}
will categorise all articles and article talk pages in Category:Wikipedia articles that are too technical from October 2015 , if the date is set October 2015 e.g. If such a category does not exist, or the date was set incorrectly, this template will also add the article to Category:Articles with invalid date parameter in template .
{{DMCA|Articles to be split|from|{{{date|}}}|All articles to be split}}
will categorise all articles in Category:Articles to be split from October 2015 , if the date is set October 2015 e.g. If such a category does not exist, or the date was set incorrectly, this template will also add the article to Category:Articles with invalid date parameter in template . In either case the article will be added to Category:All articles to be split .
{{DMCA|Dutch mathematicians}}
is the straight category Category:Dutch mathematicians .
{{TDMCA|type="Tolkien"|Articles to be split|from|{{{date|}}}|All articles to be split}}
will categorise as in the above example but also in Category:Tolkien articles to be split if it exists. If it doesn't the page will be added to the hidden Category:Articles with tags with unsupported types .
Note
An incorrect date is any date which is not of the form November 2015, e.g.
November 05, 2015

Article suggestion[ edit ]
Hey Shyamsunder, doodleblue is a technology company in Chennai, India. It is involved in lot of innovative technology projects. It would be helpful if we had an article about it on Wikipedia. Since I am new to posting contents on wilipedia, I am not very sure of the process. It would be nice if you could help me out with it.

{{Navbox with collapsible groups|child ...}}
.)
Technical details
This template uses CSS classes for most of its looks, thus it is fully skinnable.
Internally this meta template uses HTML markup instead of wiki markup for the table code. That is the usual way we make meta templates since wiki markup has several drawbacks. For instance it makes it harder to use parser functions and special characters in parameters.
For more technical details see the talk page , the CSS classes in MediaWiki:Common.css and the collapsible table used to hide the box in MediaWiki:Common.js .
Intricacies
The 2px wide border between groups and lists is drawn using the border-left property of the list cell. Thus, if you wish to change the background color of the template (for example
bodystyle = background:purple;
), then you'll need to make the border-left-color match the background color (i.e.
liststyle = border-left-color: purple;
). If you wish to have a border around each list cell, then the 2px border between the list cells and group cells will disappear; you'll have to come up with your own solution.
The list cell width is initially set to 100%. Thus, if you wish to manually set the width of group cells, you'll need to also specify the liststyle to have width: auto. If you wish to set the group width and use images, it's up to you to figure out the CSS in the groupstyle, liststyle, imagestyle, and imageleftstyle parameters to get everything to work correctly. Example of setting group width:
groupstyle = width: 10em;
liststyle = width: auto;
Adjacent navboxes have only a 1 pixel border between them (except in IE 6, which doesn't support the necessary CSS). If you set the top or bottom margin of
style/bodystyle
, then this will not work.
The default margin-left and margin-right of the outer navbox table are set to "auto;". If you wish to use navbox as a float, you need to manually set the margin-left and margin-right values, because the auto margins interfere with the float option. For example, add the following code to use the navbox as a float:
bodystyle = width: 22em; float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 0;
Copying to other projects or wikis?
Using this template on other wikis requires HTML Tidy to be turned on. A version that does not require Tidy can be found at Wikipedia:WikiProject Transwiki/Template:Navbox . (That version generally shouldn't be used here on the English Wikipedia.) More detailed information on copying {{Navbox}} to other wikis can be found on the talk page .
Known issues
If the heading of the navbox spans more than one line, the second line will be displayed to the right of center. This can be avoided by hard-coding linebreaks with
<br clear="all" />
In Internet Explorer 8 and 9, there is a bug when using
hlist
; navbox will fail to wrap the list to the next line if the list items start with an image, causing navbox to extend its width outside the screen. This can be fixed by adding
&nbsp;
in front of the images.
Excessive use of the unsubstituted
{{ • }}
template as a delimiter, can in extreme cases cause the wiki page rendering to fail — there is a limit to the number of templates that can be used on a page (example Ketamine where the inclusion of eleven Navboxes with hundreds of bullets caused the page load not to complete, only the substitution of the bullets in those navboxes cured the problem). Use of the
hlist
class avoids the delimiter transclusion issue altogether, as the delimiters are rendered via CSS.

Maintenance templates, such as {{ Citation needed }} or {{ Refimprove }}, should never be substituted. A trick to avoid that is to make a template substitute to its transcluded form.
Usage
To turn a template into a self-substituting template, wrap the existing template code with:
{{ {{{|safesubst:}}}#invoke:Unsubst||$B=   [ ... existing template code ... ]  }}
The wikitext to display when not substed must be given as "$B". A parameter "$N" may also be seen in some templates; this was required in an older version of the module, but is no longer necessary and may be removed. Such templates are automatically placed in Category:Calls to Module:Unsubst that use $N .
All other parameters passed to the #invoke will be copied to the generated template invocation as default values. If the value of any of these default parameters is "__DATE__", that value in the generated template invocation will be the current month and year.
Some templates have a <noinclude> but no matching </noinclude> at the end of the template. In such cases the missing </noinclude> must be added before the ending

Good length
the ideal place for a stock delivery to pitch in its trajectory from the bowler to the batsman. It makes the batsman uncertain whether to play a front-foot or back-foot shot. A good length differs from bowler to bowler, based on the type, height and speed of the bowler. The "good length" is not necessarily the best length to bowl, as a bowler may wish to bowl short or full to exploit a batsman's weaknesses. [1]
Googly (also wrong'un or bosie)
a deceptive spinning delivery by a leg spin bowler which spins the opposite direction to the stock delivery. For a right-hander bowler and a right-handed batsman, a googly will turn from the off side to the leg side. Developed by Bosanquet around 1900. [1] [3]
Gouging
causing intentional damage to the pitch or ball.
Gozza
Out first ball. See Golden duck.
Grafting
batting defensively with strong emphasis on not getting out, often under difficult conditions.
Green top
a pitch with an unusually high amount of visible grass, that might be expected to assist the pace bowlers.
Grip
the rubber casings used on the handle of the bat; alternatively, how the bowler holds the ball and how the batsman holds the bat.
Ground, v
to turn and touch the bat onto the ground surface behind the popping crease after the batsman has left the crease in the action of taking a shot or starting a run; to run the bat in the process of completing a run in order to be safe.
Ground, n
the batsman's safe area on the pitch. The batsman is said to be in his/her ground when a part of the body (usually the foot) or the bat is touching the ground surface behind the popping crease. The batsmen is said to have left his/her ground when he/she advances down the pitch in the action of taking a shot or has started a run. The batsman is said to have made his/her ground if able to ground his/her bat or touch the ground surface behind the popping crease with a part of the body before a fielder can break the wicket.
Groundsman (or curator)
a person responsible for maintaining the cricket field and preparing the pitch. [6]
Grubber
a delivery that barely bounces. [1]
(Taking) guard
the batsman aligning his bat according with a stump (or between stumps) chosen behind him. Typically, the batsman marks the position of the bat on the pitch. The marking(s) give the batter an idea as to where he or she is standing in relation to the stumps. [6]

This indicates that Team A in their first innings scored 240 runs, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed, and Team B are currently 130 for 4 (in this scenario, Team B is said to be facing a run chase of 316 and currently trail by 185 runs). If a team has followed-on in its second innings, this is indicated by appending "(f/o)" to their score, e.g. Team A 513, Team B 145 & 254–7 (f/o).
When a game is completed, there are standard ways of referring to the difference in scores between the two teams. For instance, if Team A, batting first, scored 254–6, then Team B, batting second, only scored 185, whether or not they go all out, it would be said that "Team A won by 69 runs" because they either bowled out the opposition or caused them to exhaust their overs (in a limited-overs match) when they were 69 runs short of their target. On the other hand, if team A, batting first, scored 254–6 but team B, batting second, scored 255–8, it would be said that "team B won by 2 wickets" because they chased down their target with 2 wickets in hand. In a two innings match, a team can win having only batted once (while the other team, batting twice, has not equalled the other team's score). For instance, team A score 160 all out, team B score 530 and declare, then team A score 230 all out. In this case it would be said that team B won by an innings & 140 runs.
Winning scores[ edit ]
In limited over matches (one innings matches), the team that scores more runs wins. So if team A scored 250 from 50 overs with the loss of 1 wicket (250–1), then the target for team B is to get 251. The number of wickets that has fallen does not affect which team has won. So if team B scored 251 but with the loss of 9 wickets (251–9), team B still won because it scored more runs, even though it lost more wickets. In a similar situation if team A scored 250/1, but team B scored 240 (all out), then team A would win because it scored more runs. Part way through a limited over match, in order to judge the likely final scores, it is important to know, in addition to runs already scored and wickets already lost, how many overs each side has remaining, so this is always quoted.
In limited overs matches shortened by bad weather, the winning team is the one whose scoring is best according to the targets set by a rain rule, usually the Duckworth-Lewis method . The method used to set targets takes into account both the number of overs and the number of wickets lost.
In First-class cricket (two innings match), the team that scores more runs, having dismissed its opponents twice, is the winner. An example would be: Team A scored 240 in their first innings, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed (they might do this because there was not much time left in the match and wanted to have time to dismiss team B and win rather than draw the game). Team A would be setting team B a target of 316 to win. If, in the second innings, team B only scored 250 (indeed anything less than 315) then team A would be the winner. If, on the other hand, team B scored 316–9, team B would be the winner. If time or the weather prevents the opposing side's being dismissed twice, the game is a draw, even if one side has scored more than the other. There is no equivalent of Duckworth-Lewis Method in these matches.
The terms draw and tie, which are synonymous in many sports, have distinct meanings in cricket. A tie refers to a match in which the game is completed and the two teams finish with exactly the same score. A draw refers to a two-innings match that does not reach a conclusion, usually through a lack of time and/or rain. A limited overs match which does not reach a conclusion due to rain is not considered a draw, but rather is said to have no result.
See also: Scoring runs in cricket
Cricket scorers keep track of many other facts of the game. As a minimum a scorer would note:
For each ball, who bowled it and how many runs were scored from it, whether by the batsman with his bat ('off the bat') or byes .
For each batsman, every scoring run made.
For each dismissal , the kind of dismissal (e.g. LBW or run out ), the bowler (in the case of a bowling, LBW, catch, wicket hit, or stumping), any other player involved (in the case of a catch, run out, or stumping), as well as the total the batting team reached at that point in the game ('the fall of wicket'). Example notations as seen on cricket scorecards:
c fielder b bowler – Caught
c & b bowler – Caught & bowled (the bowler was also the catching fielder)
lbw b bowler – Leg before wicket
st wicket-keeper b bowler – Stumped
For each bowler (his 'figures'), the number of overs bowled, the number of wickets taken, the number of runs conceded, and the number of maiden overs bowled.
Traditionally, the score book might record each ball bowled by a bowler and each ball faced by a batsman, but not necessarily which batsman faced which ball. Linear scoring systems were developed from the late 19th century and early 20th century by John Atkinson Pendlington , Bill Ferguson and Bill Frindall , to keep track of the balls faced by a batsman off each bowler. Another early method of recording the number of balls faced and runs scored by each batsman off each bowler was devised by Australian scorer J.G. Jackschon in the 1890s, using a separate memorandum alongside the main scoresheet.
Frequently more detail is recorded, for instance, for a batsman, the number of balls faced and the number of minutes batted. Sometimes charts (known as wagon wheels) are prepared showing to which part of the field each scoring shot by a batsman was made (revealing the batman's favourite places to hit the ball) [2]
Technology such as Hawk-Eye allows for more detailed analysis of a bowler's performance. For instance the beehive chart shows where a bowler's balls arrived at a batsman (high, low, wide, on the off stump etc.), while the pitch map shows where the balls pitched (trending toward short, good, or full lengths). Both charts can also show the results of these balls (dots, runs, boundaries, or wickets) [3]
Scores and points[ edit ]
In most one day competitions based on leagues, 2 points are awarded for a win and 0 for a loss, regardless of the margin of victory.
In County Championship matches league points are awarded to teams not only for winning (scoring more runs overall) or drawing a game, but also for the number of runs scored or wickets taken in the first innings of the match. These extra batting and bowling points can make a difference to who becomes the champions at the end of the season.
In a series of Test matches , the winner is the team that wins the most matches. Test series can be drawn, with both sides having the same number of wins (since match draws are a distinct possibility with Test cricket; a series need not have all games on record coming to a decision). However, in the Ashes (the series played between England and Australia), the Ashes only change hands if the holder clearly loses; the Ashes remain with the current holder if the series is drawn.



उद्देश्य[ संपादित करें ]
कीपर का प्रमुख काम उन गेंदों को पकड़ना होता है, जो बल्लेबाजों के पास से गुजर कर विकेट के पीछे चली आती हैं (जिससे कि रन बनने से रोका जा सके), लेकिन वह विभिन्न तरीकों से बल्लेबाज को आउट करने की भी कोशिश कर सकता है:
कीपर द्वारा बल्लेबाज को आउट करने का सबसे आम तरीका है बल्ले के किनारे से लग कर आ रही गेंद को जमीन पर गिरने से पहले लपक लेना . कई बार कीपर उन गेंदों को भी लपकने की स्थिति में होते हैं जब उसे बल्लेबाज द्वारा बल्ले से मारकर काफी ऊंचाई पर उड़ा दिया गया हो. किसी अन्य स्थान पर क्षेत्ररक्षण करने वाले खिलाड़ियों के मुकाबले विकेट-कीपर ही सबसे ज्यादा कैच लेते हैं।
गेंद फेंके जाने के बाद अगर बल्लेबाज अपने क्रीज से बाहर चला जाता है और गेंद विकेट कीपर के पास आ जाती है तो वो स्टंप की गिल्लियां गिराकर बल्लेबाज को स्टंप आउट कर सकता है।
जब गेंद को दूर मैदान पर मारा जाता है तो कीपर स्टंप्स के नजदीक पहुंच जाता है जिससे कि वह क्षेत्ररक्षक द्वारा फेंकी गई गेंद को लपक सके, साथ ही अगर संभव हो तो बल्लेबाज को रन आउट भी कर सके.
एक कीपर की स्थिति गेंदबाज पर निर्भर करती है: तेज गेंदबाजी हो रही हो तो वह स्टंप्स से थोड़ी दूर पर खड़ा होता है, जिससे कि बल्ले का किनारा लगकर आ रही गेंद को लपकने का उसे समय मिल सके, जबकि धीमी गेंदबाजी के वक्त वह स्टंप्स के काफी नजदीक पहुंच जाता है (इसे स्टैंडिंग अप भी कहा जाता है), जिससे कि बल्लेबाज पर यह दबाव रहे कि वो क्रीज के अंदर ही रहे या फिर स्टंप आउट होने का जोखिम उठाए. कीपर जितना ज्यादा सक्षम होगा, उतनी ही तेज गेंदबाजी को लपकने में वह कामयाब रहेगा, उदाहरण के लिए आपको बता दें कि गॉडफ्रे इवान्स अक्सर एलेक बेडसर के लिए विकेट कीपिंग करते थे। [1]
विकेट-कीपिंग एक विशेषज्ञ काम है और इसके लिए उसी तरह के प्रशिक्षण की जरूरत होती है किसी कि किसी विशेषज्ञ बल्लेबाज या गेंदबाज से उम्मीद की जाती है। हालांकि आज के समय में एक विकेट-कीपर से उम्मीद की जाती है कि वह एक अच्छा बल्लेबाज भी हो जो कम से कम मध्यक्रम में बल्लेबाजी कर सके. जो विकेट-कीपर ऊपर के क्रम में बल्लेबाजी में दक्ष होते हैं उन्हें अनौपचारिक रूप से कीपर/बल्लेबाज भी कहा जाता है।
क्रिकेट के किसी एक दल में सिर्फ एक ही कीपर की जगह होती है, ऐसे में चयनकर्ताओं को (खासकर अंतर्राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर) अक्सर दो या उससे अधिक दक्ष कीपरों में से किसी एक को चुनने की चुनौती का सामना करना पड़ता है। अक्सर ऐसा होता है कि दो कीपरों में से एक काफी बेहतरीन कीपर होता है, लेकिन वह सिर्फ एक औसत बल्लेबाज होता है, जबकि दूसरा कीपर/बल्लेबाज होता है जो बल्लेबाजी में तो बेहतर है लेकिन वह अपने प्रतिद्वंद्वी के मुकाबले उतना अच्छा कीपर नहीं है। 1990 के दशक में इंग्लैंड के चयनकर्ताओं के सामने एक ऐसी ही चयन दुविधा सामने आई थी, जब उन्हें जैक रसेल (शुद्ध विकेट-कीपर) और एलेक स्टीवर्ट (कीपर/बल्लेबाज) के बीच किसी एक को चुनने की चुनौती मिली. वे इन दोनों में से किसी एक को लगातार चुनने में तब तक कभी कामयाब नहीं हुए जब तक कि 1998 में रसेल सुस्त पड़ने लगे: इससे पहले तक दोनों की भूमिकाएं बदली जाती रहीं, अच्छी बल्लेबाजी की वजह से अक्सर स्टीवर्ट टीम में अपनी जगह बनाने में कामयाब रहते थे। इसी तरह पाकिस्तानी विकेट कीपर कामरान अकमल भी एक और उदाहरण है जो एक ऐसे विकेट कीपर के तौर पर जाना जाता है जो आसान मौकों को गंवाता है, लेकिन वह पिछले एक दशक से टीम में अपनी जगह बनाए हुए है, क्योंकि उनकी बल्लेबाजी वैकल्पिक कीपर से अच्छी है। आज क्रिकेट में महेंद्र सिंह धोनी , कुमार संगाकारा, ब्रैंडन मैक्कुलम और मार्क बाउचर जैसे बेहतरीन कीपर/बल्लेबाज हैं।
कीपर की कप्तानी की भूमिका भी हो सकती है। खास बात ये है कि वह किसी पारी की प्रत्येक गेंद में शामिल होते हैं और हो सकता है कि चीजों को वह जितनी बारीकी से देखने की स्थिति में होता है, उतनी कप्तान नहीं भी हो सकता है। उन्हें अक्सर गेंदबाजों को उत्साहित करते हुए देखा जा सकता है और वह बल्लेबाजों को उनकी क्षमता, व्यक्तित्व और निजी आदतों पर सटीक टिप्पणियों से "अपशब्द" कहने में भी लिप्त में होता है।
कीपर ही एकमात्र क्षेत्ररक्षक है जिसे रक्षात्मक उपकरण से गेंद को पकड़ने की इजाजत होती है, जो कि आमतौर पर एक बड़ा गद्दीदार दास्ताना होता है जिसकी तर्जनी और अंगूठे के बीच (लेकिन और कहीं नहीं) जाली लगी होती है। दस्ताने से जो सुरक्षा मिलती है वह हमेशा पर्याप्त नहीं होती है। इंग्लैंड के कीपर एलन नॉट अतिरिक्त सुरक्षा के लिए कभी-कभी अपने दस्ताने के अंदर गद्दी लगाया करते थे। विकेट-कीपर पैरों की सुरक्षा के लिए लेग पैड़्स और कमर के नीचे वाले हिस्से की रक्षा के लिए बॉक्स का इस्तेमाल करते हैं।
विकेट-कीपरों को अपने पैड उतारकर गेंदबाजी करने का मौका दिया जाता है और ऐसा तब अक्सर होता है जब कोई मैच बराबरी की ओर बढ़ रहा हो या फिर क्षेत्ररक्षण दल एक विकेट लेने के लिए बेताब हो. प्रथम श्रेणी क्रिकेट में दो विकेट-कीपरों ने अपना पैड उतारा और फिर हैट्रिक ली है: 1954-55 में कटक में खेले गए उड़ीसा बनाम बंगाल के मैच में प्रोबिर सेन और ए. सी.(एलन) स्मिथ ने 1965 में क्लैक्टन में वारविकशायर बनाम एसेक्स के मैच में; स्मिथ एक बेहद ही असामान्य खिलाड़ी थे, क्योंकि वो मुख्य तौर पर एक विकेट-कीपर थे, लेकिन कभी-कभी उनका चयन मुख्य गेंदबाज के रूप में भी होता था।
स्थानापन्न खिलाड़ी[ संपादित करें ]
क्रिकेट के नियमों के नियम 2 के मुताबिक एक स्थानापन्न खिलाड़ी (किसी बीमार या चोटिल खिलाड़ी की जगह लेने वाला) विकेट कीपिंग नहीं कर सकता है। [2]
बल्लेबाजी दल के कप्तान की सहमति से कभी-कभी इस नियम को रद्द भी किया जा सकता है, हालांकि नियम 2 में इस तरह की किसी सहमति की इजाजत नहीं देता है। उदाहरण के लिए, 1986 में लॉर्ड्स में खेले जा रहे इंग्लैंड और न्यूजीलैंड के बीच टेस्ट मैच की पहली पारी के दौरान इंग्लैंड के विशेषज्ञ विकेट-कीपर ब्रूस फ्रेंच चोटिल हो गए थे। तब इंग्लैंड ने न्यूजीलैंड की पहली पारी में चार खिलाड़ियों को विकेट-कीपर के तौर पर इस्तेमाल किया: बिल एथे ने पहले दो ओवरों के लिए कीपिंग की; 45 साल के वरिष्ठ खिलाड़ी बॉब टेलर को प्रायोजकों के टेंट से बुलाकर कीपिंग कराई गयी और उन्होंने 3 से 76 ओवरों तक बिना गलती के बढ़िया कीपिंग की; 77 से 140 ओवरों तक के लिए हैंपशायर के कीपर बॉबी पार्क्स को बुलाया गया; और फिर ब्रूस फ्रेंच ने पारी की आखिरी गेंद तक विकेट कीपिंग की.

Further information: Timeline of the BBC
The birth of British broadcasting, 1920–22[ edit ]
Britain's first live public broadcast from the Marconi factory in Chelmsford took place in June 1920. It was sponsored by the Daily Mail‍ '​s Lord Northcliffe and featured the famous Australian Soprano Dame Nellie Melba . The Melba broadcast caught the people's imagination and marked a turning point in the British public's attitude to radio [14] However this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications. By the Autumn of 1920, pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority, the General Post Office (GPO), was sufficient to lead to a ban on further Chelmsford broadcasts. [15]
But by 1922 the GPO had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests [16] and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members. [15] Anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the United States [17] the GPO proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufactures, to be known as the British Broadcasting Company Ltd. John Reith, a Scottish Calvinist, was appointed its General Manager in December 1922 a few weeks after the Company made its first official broadcast. [18] [19] The Company was to be financed by a royalty on the sale of BBC wireless receiving sets from approved manufacturers and by a licence fee.
From private company to public service corporation and business, 1923–26[ edit ]
The financial arrangements soon proved inadequate. Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets. [20] By mid 1923 discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster-General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the Sykes Committee. The Committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC's immediate financial distress, and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO. This was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufactures protection expired. The BBC's broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence, as was the prohibition on advertising. The BBC was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19:00, and required to source all news from external wire services.
Mid 1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration this time by the Crawford committee. By now the BBC under Reith's leadership had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service, but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion. Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with Reith keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise. The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the 1926 General Strike broke out in May. The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production and with restrictions on news bulletins waived the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis. [21]
The crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position. On one hand Reith was acutely aware that the Government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the Government if the BBC were to step out of line, but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently. The Government was divided on how to handle the BBC but ended up trusting Reith, whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM's own. Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the Government's objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing. The resulting coverage of both Striker and Government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the PM had broadcast to the nation from Reith's home, using one of Reith's sound bites inserted at the last moment, or that the BBC had banned broadcasts from the Labour Party and delayed a peace appeal by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Supporters of the Strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company. Reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from Blake's "Jerusalem" signifying that England had been saved.
The BBC did well out of the crisis which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting and was followed by the Government's official acceptance of the Crawford Committee recommendations transferring the operations of the Company to a British Broadcasting Corporation established by Royal Charter. Reith was knighted and on 1 January 1927 becoming the first Director General of the British Broadcasting Corporation.
While the BBC tends to characterise its coverage of the General Strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of Government and Strikers, Jean Seaton, Professor of Media History and the Official BBC Historian has characterised the episode as the invention of "modern propaganda in its British form". [21] Reith argued that trust gained by 'authentic impartial news' could then be used. Impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself. [22]
To represent its purpose and (stated) values, the Corporation adopted the coat of arms , including the motto "Nation shall speak peace unto Nation". The motto is generally attributed to Montague John Rendall, former headmaster of Winchester College and member of the first BBC Board of Governors. [23] The motto is said to be a "felicitous adaptation" of Micah 4: 3 "nation shall not lift up a sword against nation". [24]
1926 to 1939[ edit ]
The success of "wireless" broadcasting provoked animosities between the BBC and well established media such as theatres, concert halls and the recording industry. By 1929 the BBC complained that the agents of many London comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting, because they feared it harmed the artist "by making his material stale" and that it "reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer". On the other hand, the BBC was "keenly interested" in a cooperation with the recording companies who "in recent years ... have not been slow to make records of singers, orchestras, dance bands, etc. who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless." Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: "Day in and day out, manuscripts come in, and nearly all go out again through the post, with a note saying 'We regret, etc.'" [25]
Experimental television broadcasts were started in 1932 using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by John Logie Baird . Limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1934, and an expanded service (now named the BBC Television Service ) started from Alexandra Palace in 1936, alternating between an improved Baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic 405 line Marconi-EMI system. The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year. [26]
1939 to 2000[ edit ]
Television broadcasting was suspended from 1 September 1939 to 7 June 1946 during the Second World War . There was a widely reported urban myth that, upon resumption of service, announcer Leslie Mitchell started by saying, "As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted ..." In fact, the first person to appear when transmission resumed was Jasmine Bligh and the words said were "Good afternoon, everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh ... ?" [27]
The European Broadcasting Union was formed on 12 February 1950, in Torquay with the BBC among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations.
BBC Television Centre at White City , West London, which opened in 1960 and closed in 2013
Competition to the BBC was introduced in 1955 with the commercial and independently operated television network of ITV . However, the BBC monopoly on radio services would persist until the 8th October 1973 when under the control of the newly renamed Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) the U.K.'s first Independent local radio station, LBC came on-air in the London area. As a result of the Pilkington Committee report of 1962, in which the BBC was praised for the quality and range of its output, and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming, [28] the decision was taken to award the BBC a second television channel, BBC2 , in 1964, renaming the existing service BBC1 . BBC2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across Europe. BBC2 was broadcast in colour from 1 July 1967, and was joined by BBC1 and ITV on 15 November 1969. The 405 line VHF transmissions of BBC1 (and ITV) were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985.
Starting in 1964, a series of pirate radio stations (starting with Radio Caroline ) came on the air and forced the British government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising-financed services. In response, the BBC reorganised and renamed their radio channels. On the 30th September 1967 the Light Programme was split into Radio 1 offering continuous "Popular" music and Radio 2 more "Easy Listening". [29] The "Third" programme became Radio 3 offering classical music and cultural programming. The Home Service became Radio 4 offering news, and non-musical content such as quiz shows, readings, dramas and plays. As well as the four national channels, a series of local BBC radio stations were established in 1967, including Radio London . [30]
In 1969, the BBC Enterprises department was formed to exploit BBC brands and programmes for commercial spin-off products. In 1979 it became a wholly owned limited company, BBC Enterprises Ltd. [31]
In 1974, the BBC's teletext service, Ceefax , was introduced, created initially to provide subtitling, but developed into a news and information service. In 1978, BBC staff went on strike just before the Christmas of that year, thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one. [32] [33]
Since the deregulation of the UK television and radio market in the 1980s, the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercom third base. Naturally, the runner's objective, in this situation, is to elude the catcher's tag and touch the plate. Prior to 2014, the catcher's best strategy was to block the runner's path so as to prevent the runner from reaching the plate at all. Collisions between runners and catchers were common. Since the start of the 2014 season, a catcher may only obstruct a runner's path to home plate when he, the catcher, is in possession of the ball. Without the ball in hand, the catcher must allow the runner to score uncontested. If the catcher drops the ball while tagging the runner, the runner is safe. Although contact between a runner and a catcher was generally allowed in the major leagues until the beginning of the 2014 season, little league, high school, and college runners are encouraged or mandated to avoid significant contact. [15]
Preventing stolen bases by throwing to second base or third base to allow an infielder to tag a baserunner attempting to reach the base. A catcher who is very good at preventing stolen bases is said to have a low stolen-base percentage; a poor one has many bases stolen while he catches. (A pitcher who is slow to deliver is often more at fault for stolen bases than the catcher is.) Ideally, a catcher should be able to get the ball from his glove to that of the player covering second base in under two seconds. This is referred to as a catcher's "pop time", the time elapsing between the popping sound of the pitch striking the catcher's mitt and the similar pop when the ball arrives at the glove of the fielder covering second base.
Rarely, a catcher can make a successful pick-off throw to a base to surprise an inattentive or incautious baserunner. Especially at the higher levels of baseball (where this play almost never results in an out), the catcher's snap throws are mainly for psychological effect. If the runner knows that the catcher often attempts snap throws, the runner is likely to take a smaller lead from his base before each pitch, which will allow the infielders an extra fraction of a second to throw the runner out at the next base if he attempts to advance (as, for example, when a ground ball is hit). Yadier Molina of the St. Louis Cardinals is known for using pickoffs with success, particularly at first base. [16] Teams may sometimes call a deliberate play, the pitchout , wherein the pitcher intentionally throws the ball wide and high to the catcher, who comes out of his crouch to receive it and relays the ball quickly to a base to put a runner out.
Rarely, a catcher will run to first base or third base to participate in rundown plays at those bases.
In certain game situations, typically a ball batted to the shortstop or third baseman with no runners on base, the catcher may be expected to back-up first base in case the first baseman misses or mishandles a throw.
In certain game situations, when a runner is on first and the batter bunts the ball or hits the ball softly in which causing the third baseman to rush in to get the ball and throw to first base, the catcher must cover third base so that the runner from first base does not advance to third base on the play and this then forces the third baseman to cover home plate.
Any failure by the catcher can have dire consequences for his team. Passed balls are possible whenever one or more runners are on base. A failure to catch a ball thrown from the outfield on a play at home plate, or a failure to tag a runner, means that the defensive team fails to record an all-important out and, instead, it allows a run. On an attempt to prevent a stolen base, a catcher's bad throw might careen past the infielder and skip into the outfield , allowing an additional advance by the baserunner.
Personal catcher[ edit ]
Because of the close mental relationship and trust that a successful pitcher must have with his catcher, a number of catchers throughout history have become preferred by pitchers on their teams, to the point that that catcher will almost always (especially during the regular season) start along with the pitcher. The catcher is then informally referred to as that pitcher's personal catcher. [17]
Naturally, the potential problem with this arrangement is that if the pitcher prefers to work with the team's backup catcher, then the regular catcher—presumably the better player—must be benched. However, this is somewhat leavened by the fact that, due to the physically grueling nature of the position, even "regular" catchers are normally asked to rest relatively frequently.
Personal catchers are often used for pitchers that specialize in throwing knuckleballs , due to the difficulty of catching such an inconsistent and erratic pitch.
Some personal catchers have included:

England's Moeen Ali hit a dominant 90 off 50 balls - after being dropped before scoring - and took two catches to give Worcestershire their second NatWest T20 Blast victory by 14 runs over winless Northamptonshire at Wantage Road.
But the game will be remembered for one of the strangest field placings seen in English cricket for years.
During Worcestershire's stint in the field, their captain Daryl Mitchell asked wicketkeeper Ben Cox to ditch his gloves and pads and become an extra fielder - leaving no one behind the stumps.
The ploy developed as an extension of MS Dhoni's decision to stand back to the spinners while keeping for India in the Test series in England last summer.
The umpires, after consultation, allowed it. "In a game when you're trying to stop the opposition scoring, it's a legitimate tactic," Steve Rhodes, the Worcestershire director of cricket, said.
Moeen's second over - the 16th of the innings - saw Cox remove gloves and pads and go to fly-slip, with no one standing up to the stumps. Umpires Nick Cook and Graham Lloyd conferred at length and allowed play to continue, with Mitchell persisting in the tactic for the spinners from thereon.
"One of the things I challenged the coaches in the winter to do, was to try and come up with some ideas that might just knock the opposition off their guard a little bit," Rhodes said. "It came about when I watched MS Dhoni stand back to the spinners for India and I thought that was a great idea. Afterwards, he said he wanted another catcher around the corner and he felt he could do that himself, standing back. That's how it started us thinking about it."
Cobb said: "I saw Daryl Mitchell tell Ben Cox to go back and I thought he was going to keep from the edge of the ring. Then I turned around and saw him without pads or gloves on. It's in the Laws and they've obviously looked into it and there's no Law against it. You've just got to question whether it's in the spirit of the game. But that's probably because it's never been done before. When they first come out, these things usually get questioned and left alone."
Earlier, Moeen - who scored just 104 runs in the recent Test series against New Zealand - should have been caught from the first legitimate delivery of the game, after Worcestershire won the toss and batted first. Another England hopeful David Willey produced the edge, but Rory Kleinveldt put down the straightforward chance at slip.
Insights
Northamptonshire are bottom of the North Group having played three and lost three and are the only team without a win in the competition. They haven't come close to winning in any of the three encounters and, looking at their team just look a little short of star quality that can turn losses into victories.
Afridi was a marquee signing but is a player past his best and ends his stint at the county with just 34 runs to his name and having bowled 12 overs with the reward of 3 for 96 - not terrible, but not enough from a team requiring more from their overseas player.
Mitchell was also dropped in the next Willey over by Kleinveldt, albeit to a more difficult opportunity.  And the opening pair exploited Northants' generosity to put on 52 in the first six overs.
Northants - the only county without a T20 win so far - appeared to lose confidence when Moeen stepped up the assault against Shahid Afridi. Using his international class, he lofted over extra-cover and cut through backward point, before viciously pulling over midwicket for six that brought up a speedy 50 off 32 balls.
Mitchell was bowled by Afridi for 43 in the thirteenth, with 131 on the board, and Moeen's momentum was only checked by a brilliant one-handed catch by Northamptonshire captain Alex Wakely at cover as he drove at Steven Crook. His 90 included 5 sixes and 11 fours. The home attack looked lacklustre and conceded eight wides in all. Worcestershire's total of 211 for 3 was the highest on the ground, beating Northants' 207 for 4 against Glamorgan in 2008.
In the chase of 212, Richard Levi and Josh Cobb's second wicket partnership resulted in 65 runs in six overs but Northamptonshire's reply never received the same level of impetus. Cobb's first white-ball fifty in Steelback colours came off 31 balls.
Saeed Ajmal's opening spell - his first in England since remodelling his action in an ICC clinic - produced three overs going for 44 runs.
Northants needed 57 off 23 balls when Shahid Afridi came to the crease and despite two big sixes off Joe Leach, Ajmal returned to have his Pakistani colleague caught by Moeen at long-on with Cobb falling two balls later in the same manner.  Ajmal finished with figures of 3 for 53.
Cobb's 80 off 44 balls which included six sixes, was his highest score in T20 cricket and it helped Northants post 197 for 7, which in itself was the third highest T20 score on the ground, but it was the visitors who claimed victory by 14 runs and more to spare than the margin suggested.

Early years[ edit ]
“
This is London calling – 2LO calling. Here is the first general news bulletin, copyright by Reuters , Press Association , Exchange Telegraph and Central News .
”
— BBC news programme opening during the 1920s [6]
The British Broadcasting Company broadcast its first radio bulletin from radio station 2LO on 14 November 1922. [7] Wishing to avoid competition, newspaper publishers persuaded the government to ban the BBC from broadcasting news before 7 PM, and to force it to use wire service copy instead of reporting on its own. [6] On Easter weekend in 1930, this reliance on newspaper wire services left the radio news service with no information to report. Piano music was played instead. [8] The BBC gradually gained the right to edit the copy and, in 1934, created its own news operation. However, it could not broadcast news before 6 PM until World War II . [6] Gaumont British and Movietone cinema newsreels had been broadcast on the TV service since 1936, with the BBC producing its own equivalent Television Newsreel programme from January 1948. A weekly Children's Newsreel was inaugurated on 23 April 1950, to around 350,000 receivers. [9] The network began simulcasting its radio news on television in 1946 with a still picture of Big Ben . [6] Televised bulletins began on 5 July 1954, broadcast from leased studios within Alexandra Palace in London. [10] [ not in citation given ]
The public's interest in television and live events was stimulated by Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953. It is estimated that up to 27 million people [11] viewed the programme in the UK, overtaking radio's audience of 12 million for the first time. [12] Those live pictures were fed from 21 cameras in central London to Alexandra Palace for transmission, and then on to other UK transmitters opened in time for the event. [13] That year, there were around two million TV Licences held in the UK , rising to over three million the following year, and four and a half million by 1955.
1950s[ edit ]
Television news, although physically separate from its radio counterpart, was still firmly under radio news' control– correspondents provided reports for both outlets–and that first bulletin, shown on 5 July 1954 on the then BBC television service and presented by Richard Baker , involved his providing narration off-screen while stills were shown. [14] This was then followed by the customary Television Newsreel with a recorded commentary by John Snagge (and on other occasions by Andrew Timothy ).
It was revealed that this had been due to producers fearing a newsreader with visible facial movements would distract the viewer from the story. On-screen newsreaders were finally introduced a year later in 1955 – Kenneth Kendall (the first to appear in vision), Robert Dougall , and Richard Baker–three weeks before ITN 's launch on 21 September 1955.
Mainstream television production had started to move out of Alexandra Palace in 1950 [15] to larger premises – mainly at Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush , west London – taking Current Affairs (then known as Talks Department) with it. It was from here that the first Panorama , a new documentary programme, was transmitted on 11 November 1953, with Richard Dimbleby becoming anchor in 1955. [16] On 18 February 1957, the topical early-evening programme Tonight , hosted by Cliff Michelmore and designed to fill the airtime provided by the abolition of the Toddlers' Truce , was broadcast from Marconi's Viking Studio in St Mary Abbott's Place, Kensington – with the programme moving into a Lime Grove studio in 1960, where it already maintained its production office.
On 28 October 1957, the Today programme , a morning radio programme, was launched in central London on the Home Service . [17]
In 1958, Hugh Carleton Greene became head of News and Current Affairs. He set up a BBC study group whose findings, published in 1959, were critical of what the television news operation had become under his predecessor, Tahu Hole . The report proposed that the head of television news should take control (away from radio), and that the television service should have a proper newsroom of its own, with an editor-of-the-day. [18]
1960s[ edit ]
On 1 January 1960, Greene became Director-General and brought about big changes at BBC Television and BBC Television News. BBC Television News had been created in 1955 in response to the founding of ITN. The changes made by Greene were aimed at making BBC reporting more similar to ITN which had been highly rated by study groups held by Greene.
A newsroom was created at Alexandra Palace, television reporters were recruited and given the opportunity to write and voice their own scripts–without the "impossible burden" of having to cover stories for radio too. [19]
In 1987, almost thirty years later, John Birt , resurrected the practice of correspondents working for both TV and radio with the introduction of bi-media journalism, [20] and 2008 saw tri-media introduced across TV, radio, and online.
On 20 June 1960, Nan Winton , the first female BBC network newsreader, appeared in vision. [21] 19 September saw the start of the radio news and current affairs programme The Ten O'clock News. [22]
BBC2 started transmission on 20 April 1964, and with it came a new news programme for that channel, Newsroom .
The World at One , a lunchtime news programme, began on 4 October 1965 on the then Home Service, and the year before News Review had started on television. News Review was a summary of the week's news, first broadcast on Sunday, 26 April 1964 [23] on BBC 2 and harking back to the weekly Newsreel Review of the Week, produced from 1951, to open programming on Sunday evenings–the difference being that this incarnation had subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. As this was the decade before electronic caption generation, each superimposition ("super") had to be produced on paper or card, synchronised manually to studio and news footage , committed to tape during the afternoon, and broadcast early evening. Thus Sundays were no longer a quiet day for news at Alexandra Palace. The programme ran until the 1980s [24] – by then using electronic captions, known as Anchor – to be superseded by Ceefax subtitling (a similar Teletext format), and the signing of such programmes as See Hear (from 1981).
On Sunday 17 September 1967 The World This Weekend , a weekly news and current affairs programme, launched on what was then Home Service, but soon-to-be Radio 4 .
Preparations for colour began in the autumn of 1967 and on Thursday 7 March 1968 Newsroom on BBC2 moved to an early evening slot, becoming the first UK news programme to be transmitted in colour [25] – from Studio A at Alexandra Palace. News Review and Westminster (the latter a weekly review of Parliamentary happenings) were "colourised" shortly after.
However, much of the insert material was still in black and white, as initially only a part of the film coverage shot in and around London was on colour reversal film stock , and all regional and many international contributions were still in black and white. Colour facilities at Alexandra Palace were technically very limited for the next eighteen months, as it had only one RCA colour Quadruplex videotape machine and, eventually two Pye plumbicon colour telecines –although the news colour service started with just one.
Black and white national bulletins on BBC 1 continued to originate from Studio B on weekdays, along with Town and Around , the London regional " opt out " programme broadcast throughout the 1960s (and the BBC's first regional news programme for the South East), until it started to be replaced by Nationwide on Tuesday to Thursday from Lime Grove Studios early in September 1969. Town and Around was never to make the move to Television Centre – instead it became London This Week which transmitted on Mondays and Fridays only from the new TVC studios. [26]
Television News moves to Television Centre[ edit ]
Television News moved to BBC Television Centre in September 1969
The final news programme to come from Alexandra Palace was a late night news on BBC 2 on Friday 19 September 1969 in colour. It was said that over this September weekend, it took 65 removal vans to transfer the contents of Alexandra Palace across London. [27] BBC Television News resumed operations the next day with a lunchtime bulletin on BBC 1 – in black and white – from Television Centre, where it remained until March 2013.
This move to better technical facilities, but much smaller studios, allowed Newsroom and News Review to replace back projection with Colour-separation overlay . It also allowed all news output to be produced in PAL colour, ahead of the development in all of BBC 1 from 15 November 1969 – and, like Alexandra Palace Studio A, these studios too were capable of operating in NTSC for the US, Canada, and Japan as the BBC occasionally provided facilities for overseas broadcasters. During the 1960s satellite communication had become possible, [28] however colour field-store standards converters were still in their infancy in 1968 [29] and it was some years before digital line-store conversion was able to undertake the process seamlessly. [30]
1970s[ edit ]
Angela Rippon, pictured in 1983, became the first female news presenter in 1975
On 14 September 1970 the first Nine O'Clock News was broadcast on television. Robert Dougall presented the first week from studio N1 [31] – described by The Guardian [32] as "a sort of polystyrene padded cell" [33] —the bulletin having been moved from the earlier time of 20.50 as a response to the ratings achieved by ITN's News at Ten , introduced three years earlier on the rival ITV. Richard Baker and Kenneth Kendall presented subsequent weeks, thus echoing those first television bulletins of the mid-1950s.
Angela Rippon became the first female news presenter of the Nine O'Clock News in 1975. Her work outside the news was controversial at the time, appearing on The Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1976 singing and dancing. [31]
The first edition of John Craven 's Newsround, initially intended only as a short series and later renamed just Newsround , came from studio N3 on 4 April 1972.
Afternoon television news bulletins during the mid to late 1970s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself, rather than one of the three news studios. The newsreader would present to camera while sitting on the edge of a desk; behind him staff would be seen working busily at their desks. This period corresponded with when the Nine O'Clock News got its next makeover, and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening.
Also in the mid-1970s, the late night news on BBC 2 was briefly renamed Newsnight, [34] but this was not to last, or be the same programme as we know today – that would be launched in 1980 – and it soon reverted to being just a news summary with the early evening BBC 2 news expanded to become Newsday.
News on radio was to change in the 1970s, and on Radio 4 in particular, brought about by the arrival of new editor Peter Woon from television news and the implementation of the Broadcasting in the Seventies report. These included the introduction of correspondents into news bulletins where previously only a newsreader would present, as well as the inclusion of content gathered in the preparation process. New programmes were also added to the daily schedule, PM and The World Tonight as part of the plan for the station to become a "wholly speech network". [32] Newsbeat launched as the news service on Radio 1 on 10 September 1973. [35]
On 23 September 1974, a teletext system which was launched to bring news content on television screens using text only was launched. Engineers originally began developing such a system to bring news to deaf viewers, but the system was expanded. The Ceefax service became much more diverse before it ceased on 23 October 2012: it not only had subtitling for all channels, it also gave information such as weather, flight times and film reviews.
By the end of the decade, the practice of shooting on film for inserts in news broadcasts was declining, with the introduction of ENG technology into the UK. The equipment would gradually became less cumbersome – the BBC's first attempts had been using a Philips colour camera with backpack base station and separate portable Sony U-matic recorder in the latter half of the decade.
1980s[ edit ]
By 1982 ENG technology had become sufficiently reliable for Bernard Hesketh to use an Ikegami camera to cover the Falklands War , coverage for which he won the " Royal Television Society Cameraman of the Year" award [36] and a BAFTA nomination [37] – the first time that BBC News had relied upon an electronic camera, rather than film, in a conflict zone. BBC News won the BAFTA for its actuality coverage, [38] however the event has become remembered in television terms for Brian Hanrahan 's reporting where he coined the phrase "I'm not allowed to say how many planes joined the raid, but I counted them all out and I counted them all back" [39] to circumvent restrictions, and which has become cited as an example of good reporting under pressure. [40]
Two years earlier, the Iranian Embassy Siege had been shot electronically by the BBC Television News Outside broadcasting team, and the work of reporter Kate Adie , broadcasting live from Prince's Gate , was nominated for BAFTA actuality coverage, but this time beaten by ITN for the 1980 award. [41]
Newsnight , the news and current affairs programme, was due to go on air on 23 January 1980, although trade union disagreements meant that its launch from Lime Grove was postponed by a week. [20] On 27 August 1981 Moira Stuart became the first African Caribbean female newsreader to appear on British television.
The first BBC breakfast television programme, Breakfast Time also launched during the 1980s, on 17 January 1983 from Lime Grove Studio E and two weeks before its ITV rival TV-am . Frank Bough , Selina Scott , and Nick Ross helped to wake viewers with a relaxed style of presenting. [42]
The Six O'Clock News first aired on 3 September 1984, eventually becoming the most watched news programme in the UK (however, since 2006 it has been overtaken by the BBC News at Ten ).
Starting in 1981, the BBC gave a common theme to its main news bulletins with new electronic titles–a set of computer animated "stripes" forming a circle [43] on a red background with a "BBC News" typescript appearing below the circle graphics, and a theme tune consisting of brass and keyboards. The Nine used a similar (striped) number 9. The red background was replaced by a blue from 1985 until 1987.
By 1987, the BBC had decided to re-brand its bulletins and established individual styles again for each one with differing titles and music, the weekend and holiday bulletins branded in a similar style to the Nine, although the "stripes" introduction continued to be used until 1989 on occasions where a news bulletin was screened out of the running order of the schedule. [44]
1990s[ edit ]
The combined newsroom for domestic television and radio was opened at Television Centre in West London in 1998.
During the 1990s, a wider range of services began to be offered by BBC News, with the split of BBC World Service Television to become BBC World (news and current affairs), and BBC Prime (light entertainment). Content for a 24-hour news channel was thus required, followed in 1997 with the launch of domestic equivalent BBC News 24 . Rather than set bulletins, ongoing reports and coverage was needed to keep both channels functioning and meant a greater emphasis in budgeting for both was necessary. In 1998, after 66 years at Broadcasting House, the BBC Radio News operation moved to BBC Television Centre . [45]
New technology, provided by Silicon Graphics , came into use in 1993 for a re-launch of the main BBC 1 bulletins, creating a virtual set which appeared to be much larger than it was physically. The relaunch also brought all bulletins into the same style of set with only small changes in colouring, titles, and music to differentiate each. A computer generated glass sculpture of the BBC coat of arms was the centrepiece of the programme titles until the large scale corporate rebranding of news services in 1999.
In 1999, the biggest relaunch occurred, with BBC One bulletins, BBC World, BBC News 24, and BBC News Online all adopting a common style. One of the most significant changes was the gradual adoption of the corporate image by the BBC regional news programmes , giving a common style across local, national and international BBC television news. This also included Newyddion , the main news programme of Welsh language channel S4C , produced by BBC News Wales.
2000s[ edit ]
Following the relaunch of BBC News the previous year, regional headlines were included at the start of the BBC One news bulletins in 2000. The English regions did however lose five minutes at the end of their bulletins, due to a new headline round-up at 18:55. 2000 also saw the Nine O'Clock News moved to the later time of 22:00. This was in response to ITN who had just moved their popular News at Ten programme to 23:00. ITN briefly returned News at Ten but following poor ratings when head to head against the BBC's Ten O'Clock News, the ITN bulletin was moved to 22.30, where it remained until 14 January 2008.
The retirement of Peter Sissons and departure of Michael Buerk from the Ten O'Clock News led to changes in the BBC One bulletin presenting team on 20 January 2003. The Six O'Clock News became double headed with George Alagiah and Sophie Raworth after Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce moved to present the Ten. At the time of the changes, a new set design featuring a projected background image of a fictional newsroom was introduced. New programme titles were introduced on 16 February 2004 to match those of BBC News 24.
BBC News 24 and BBC World introduced a new style of presentation in December 2003, that was slightly altered on 5 July 2004 to mark 50 years of BBC Television News. [46]
The individual positions of editor of the One and Six O'Clock News were replaced by a new daytime position in November 2005. Kevin Bakhurst became the first Controller of BBC News 24, replacing the position of editor. Amanda Farnsworth became daytime editor while Craig Oliver was later named editor of the Ten O'Clock News. The bulletins also began to be simulcast with News 24, as a way of pooling resources.
Bulletins received new titles and a new set design in May 2006, to allow for Breakfast to move into the main studio for the first time since 1997. The new set featured Barco videowall screens with a background of the London skyline used for main bulletins and originally an image of cirrus clouds against a blue sky for Breakfast. This was later replaced following viewer criticism. [47] The studio bore similarities with the ITN-produced ITV News in 2004, though ITN uses a CSO Virtual studio rather than the actual screens at BBC News.
BBC News became part of a new BBC Journalism group in November 2006 as part of a restructuring of the BBC. The then-Director of BBC News, Helen Boaden reported to the then-Deputy Director-General and head of the journalism group, Mark Byford until he was made redundant in 2010. [48]
On 18 October 2007, Mark Thompson announced a six-year plan, Delivering Creative Future, merging the television current affairs department into a new "News Programmes" division. [49] [50] Thompson's announcement, in response to a £2 billion shortfall in funding, would, he said, deliver "a smaller but fitter BBC" in the digital age, by cutting its payroll and, in 2013, selling the Television Centre . [51]
The various separate newsrooms for television, radio and online operations were merged into a single multimedia newsroom. Programme making within the newsrooms was brought together to form a multimedia programme making department. BBC World Service director Peter Horrocks said that the changes would achieve efficiency at a time of cost-cutting at the BBC. In his blog, he wrote that by using the same resources across the various broadcast media meant fewer stories could be covered, or by following more stories, there would be fewer ways to broadcast them. [52]
A new graphics and video playout system was introduced for production of television bulletins in January 2007. This coincided with a new structure to BBC World News bulletins, editors favouring a section devoted to analysing the news stories reported on.
The first new BBC News bulletin since the Six O'Clock News was announced in July 2007 following a successful trial in the Midlands. [53] The summary, lasting 90 seconds, has been broadcast at 20:00 on weekdays since December 2007 and bears similarities with 60 Seconds on BBC Three , but also includes headlines from the various BBC regions and a weather summary.
As part of a long-term cost cutting programme, bulletins were renamed the BBC News at One, Six and Ten respectively in April 2008 while BBC News 24 was renamed BBC News and moved into the same studio as the bulletins at BBC Television Centre. [54] [55] BBC World was renamed BBC World News and regional news programmes were also updated with the new presentation style, designed by Lambie-Nairn . [56]
The studio moves also meant that Studio N9, previously used for BBC World, was closed, and operations moved to the previous studio of BBC News 24. Studio N9 was later refitted to match the new branding, and was used for the BBC's UK local elections and European elections coverage in early June 2009.
2010s[ edit ]
The new newsroom in Broadcasting House
A strategy review of the BBC in March 2010 confirmed that having "the best journalism in the world" would form one of five key editorial policies, as part of changes subject to public consultation and BBC Trust approval. [57]
After a period of suspension in late 2012, Helen Boaden ceased to be the Director of BBC News. [58] On 16 April 2013, incoming BBC Director-General Tony Hall named James Harding , a former editor of The Times of London newspaper as Director of News and Current Affairs. [5]
From August 2012 to March 2013, all news operations moved from Television Centre to new facilities in the refurbished and extended Broadcasting House , in Portland Place . The move began in October 2012, and also included the BBC World Service, which moved from Bush House following the expiry of the BBC's lease. [59] This new extension to the north and east, referred to as "New Broadcasting House", includes several new state-of-the-art radio and television studios centred around an 11-storey atrium. [60] The move began with the domestic programme The Andrew Marr Show on 2 September 2012 and concluded with the move of the BBC News channel and domestic news bulletins on 18 March 2013. [61] [62] [63] The newsroom houses all domestic bulletins and programmes on both television and radio, as well as the BBC World Service international radio networks and the BBC World News international television channel.
Television[ edit ]

BBC News is responsible for the news programmes – and some documentary content – on the BBC's general television channels, as well as the news coverage on the BBC News channel in the UK and 22 hours of programming for the corporation's BBC World News channel internationally. Coverage for BBC Parliament is carried out on behalf on the BBC at Millbank Studios though BBC News provides editorial and journalistic content. BBC News content is also output onto the BBC's digital interactive television services under the BBC Red Button brand, and until 2012, on the Ceefax teletext system.
The distinctive music on all BBC television news programmes was introduced in 1999 and composed by David Lowe . It was part of the extensive re-branding which commenced in 1999 and features the classic ' BBC Pips '. The general theme was used not only on bulletins on BBC One but News 24, BBC World and local news programmes in the BBC's Nations and Regions . Lowe was also responsible for the music on Radio One's Newsbeat . The theme has had several changes since 1999, the latest in March 2013.
The BBC Arabic Television news channel launched on 11 March 2008, a Persian-language channel followed on 14 January 2009, broadcasting from the Peel wing of Broadcasting House; both include news, analysis, interviews, sports and highly cultural programmes and are run by the BBC World Service and funded from a grant-in-aid from the British Foreign Office (and not the television licence ). [64]
Radio[ edit ]
BBC Radio News produces bulletins for the BBC's national radio stations and provides content for local BBC radio stations via the General News Service (GNS), a BBC-internal [65] news distribution service. BBC News does not produce the BBC's regional news bulletins, which are produced individually by the BBC nations and regions themselves. The BBC World Service broadcasts to some 150 million people in English as well as 27 languages across the globe. [66] BBC Radio News is a patron of The Radio Academy . [67]
Main article: BBC News Online
BBC News Online is the BBC's news website. Launched in November 1997, it is one of the most popular news websites in the UK, reaching over a quarter of the UK's internet users, and worldwide, with around 14 million global readers every month. [68] The website contains international news coverage as well as entertainment, sport, science, and political news. [69]
Many television and radio programmes are also available to view on the BBC iPlayer service. The BBC News channel is also available to view 24 hours a day, while video and radio clips are also available within online news articles. [70]

Political and commercial independence[ edit ]
The BBC is required by its charter to be free from both political and commercial influence and answers only to its viewers and listeners. This political objectivity is sometimes questioned. For instance, The Daily Telegraph (3 August 2005) carried a letter from the KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky , referring to it as "The Red Service". Books have been written on the subject, including anti-BBC works like Truth Betrayed by W J West and The Truth Twisters by Richard Deacon.
The BBC's Editorial Guidelines on Politics and Public Policy state that whilst "the voices and opinions of opposition parties must be routinely aired and challenged", "the government of the day will often be the primary source of news". [71]
The BBC is regularly accused by the government of the day of bias in favour of the opposition and, by the opposition, of bias in favour of the government. Similarly, during times of war, the BBC is often accused by the UK government, or by strong supporters of British military campaigns, of being overly sympathetic to the view of the enemy. An edition of Newsnight at the start of the Falklands War in 1982 was described as "almost treasonable" by John Page , MP, who objected to Peter Snow saying "if we believe the British". [72]
During the first Gulf War , critics of the BBC took to using the satirical name "Baghdad Broadcasting Corporation". [73] During the Kosovo War , the BBC were labelled the "Belgrade Broadcasting Corporation" (suggesting favouritism towards the FR Yugoslavia government over ethnic Albanian rebels) by British ministers, [73] although Slobodan Milosević (then FRY president) claimed that the BBC's coverage had been biased against his nation. [74]
Conversely, some of those who style themselves anti-establishment in the United Kingdom or who oppose foreign wars have accused the BBC of pro-establishment bias or of refusing to give an outlet to "anti-war" voices. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq a study, by the Cardiff University School of Journalism, of the reporting of the war, found that nine out of 10 references to weapons of mass destruction during the war assumed that Iraq possessed them, and only one in 10 questioned this assumption. It also found that out of the main British broadcasters covering the war the BBC was the most likely to use the British government and military as its source. It was also the least likely to use independent sources, like the Red Cross, who were more critical of the war. When it came to reporting Iraqi casualties the study found fewer reports on the BBC than on the other three main channels. The report's author, Justin Lewis , wrote "Far from revealing an anti-war BBC, our findings tend to give credence to those who criticised the BBC for being too sympathetic to the government in its war coverage. Either way, it is clear that the accusation of BBC anti-war bias fails to stand up to any serious or sustained analysis." [75]
Prominent BBC appointments are constantly assessed by the British media and political establishment for signs of political bias. The appointment of Greg Dyke as Director-General was highlighted by press sources because Dyke was a Labour Party member and former activist, as well as a friend of Tony Blair . The BBC's current Political Editor, Nick Robinson , was some years ago a chairman of the Young Conservatives and did, as a result, attract informal criticism from the former Labour government, but his predecessor Andrew Marr faced similar claims from the right because he was editor of The Independent , a liberal-leaning newspaper, before his appointment in 2000.
Mark Thompson , former Director-General of the BBC, admitted the organisation has been biased "towards the left" in the past. He said, "In the BBC I joined 30 years ago, there was, in much of current affairs, in terms of people's personal politics, which were quite vocal, a massive bias to the left". [76] He then added, "The organization did struggle then with impartiality. Now it is a completely different generation. There is much less overt tribalism among the young journalists who work for the BBC."
India[ edit ]
In 2008, the BBC was criticised by some for referring to the terrorists who carried out the November 2008 Mumbai attacks as "gunmen". [77] [78] The response to this added to prior criticism from some Indian commentators suggesting that the BBC may have an Indophobic bias. [79] In March 2015 the BBC was criticised for airing a documentary interviewing one of the rapists in India. In spite of a ban ordered by the Indian High court, the BBC still aired the documentary. [80] As a result, the Indian Government may take appropriate action on the corporation, and may ban the BBC from operating and reporting in India.[ citation needed ]

Usage
{{Football squad}} is designed to be used within squad list templates (typically placed at the bottom of a player page) in order to make editing and standardisation easier. If you want to use this template first set up a new template for your squad, typically called something like Template:(team name) squad.
Templates useful for formatting the list are:
{{ football squad2 player }} - takes parameters "no" (number) and "name" (player name).
{{ football squad manager }} - takes the parameter "name" (manager name) and the optional parameter "title" (defaults to Manager, other commonly assigned values are Coach and Head Coach). Has no bullet mark afterward, use only as the last entry on a list.
Options

Latham is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker . In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte -Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. [6]
In 2005, Latham introduced the "Angie Fatino Save the Children from Meth Act" in memory of an Iowa teenager who struggled with a Methamphetamine addiction for three years before she committed suicide at the age of 15 years in 1997. Though the bill died in committee, the Iowa legislature has since passed similar legislation and federal law has now been enacted limiting the sale of pseudoephedrine . [7]
See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa, 2010 § District 4
Latham was elected as the congressman for Iowa's 5th congressional district in 1994 [2] as part of the wave that allowed Republicans to take over the House for the first time since 1955. The 5th was far and away the most Republican district in the state, and Latham never faced a serious challenge as the 5th District's congressman. In 1994 he defeated Democrat Sheila McGuire garnering 61 percent of the vote. In 1996 he won 65 percent of the vote in defeating Democrat MacDonald Smith, and he ran unopposed in the 1998 election. [2]
For his first four terms, Latham represented a district that stretched from Sioux City in the northwest all the way to Mason City . The 2000 round of redistricting, however, significantly altered Iowa's congressional map. Latham's home in Alexander, along with most of the eastern third of his old district, was placed in the new 4th District in the north-central part of the state. This district was considered much more competitive than Latham's old district. For the 2008 elections, it had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+0.4, making it one of the most marginal districts in the nation. However, he was reelected four times from this district without much difficulty. This may be because he is the only Iowan on the powerful House Appropriations Committee . [2] It is considered very difficult to unseat an Appropriations Committee member.
In the 2006 election, neither the Republican nor Democratic parties had a contested primary. His opponent in the 2006 general election was Selden Spencer, a neurologist from Huxley. Latham, who had moved to Ames , closer to the center of the district, earned 57.3% of the vote as he won reelection.
In the 2008 election Latham won against Democratic nominee Becky Greenwald with 61 percent of the vote even as Barack Obama carried the district by eight points.
In 2010, Latham won against Democratic nominee Bill Maske, a school administrator.
Iowa lost a district as a result of the 2010 census. The new congressional map placed Latham and fellow Republican Steve King into the same district. The district was pushed well to the west, and now extended from Mason City to Sioux City. Indeed, it closely resembled the territory Latham represented for his first four terms. [8] Although the reconfigured 4th contained 55 percent of Latham's former territory, he opted to run in the reconfigured 3rd District, which stretches from Des Moines to Council Bluffs . He sold his home in Ames and bought a home in Clive , a suburb of Des Moines. [9] He defeated Democratic incumbent Leonard Boswell in the 2012 election.
On February 27, 2013, Latham announced that he will not seek the open Senate seat of Tom Harkin in 2014.

വിക്കറ്റ് കീപ്പറുടെ ധർമങ്ങൾ[ തിരുത്തുക ]
ബാറ്റ്സ്മാന് അടിച്ചകറ്റാൻ സാധിക്കാതെ വിക്കറ്റിന് പിന്നിലേക്ക് പോകുന്ന പന്തുകൾ തടഞ്ഞ് അധിക ( ബൈ ) റണ്ണുകൾ ബാറ്റ്സ്മാൻ നേടുന്നതിൽനിന്ന് തടയുക എന്നതാണ് വിക്കറ്റ് കീപ്പറിന്റെ പ്രാഥമിക ധർമം. വിക്കറ്റ് കീപ്പറിന് താഴെപ്പറയുന്ന രീതികളിലൂടെ ബാറ്റ്സ്മാനെ പുറത്താക്കാൻ സാധിക്കും;
ക്യാച്ചിലൂടെ പുറത്താക്കുക- ക്രിക്കറ്റിൽ ഏറ്റവും സർവസാധാരണയായി കണ്ടുവരുന്ന പുറത്താക്കൽ രീതിയാണ് ഇത്. ബാറ്റ്സ്മാന്റെ ബാറ്റിന്റെ അഗ്രഭാഗങ്ങളിൽ തട്ടിയ ശേഷം പിന്നിലേക്ക് വരുന്ന പന്തുകളിലും, നേരെ മുകളിലേക്ക് ഉയരുന്ന പന്തുകളിലുമാണ് ഇത് സംഭവിക്കുന്നത്.
സ്റ്റംപിങ്ങിലൂടെ പുറത്താക്കുക- ബൗളർ എറിയുന്ന പന്തു അടിച്ചകകറ്റാനോ പ്രതിരോധിക്കാനോ ഉള്ള ശ്രമത്തിനിടെ ക്രീസിനു പുറത്തിറങ്ങുന്ന ബാറ്റ്സ്മാനെ കടന്നു പോകുന്ന പന്തുകൾ പിടിയിലൊതുക്കി സ്റ്റമ്പ് ചെയ്തു പുറത്താക്കാൻ വിക്കറ്റ് കീപ്പർക്ക് സാധിക്കും.
റൺ ഔട്ടിലൂടെ പുറത്താക്കുക- ബാറ്റ്സ്മാൻ ഔട്ട് ഫീൽഡിലേക്ക് അടിക്കുന്ന പന്ത് ഏതെങ്കിലും ഫീൽഡർ തടഞ്ഞ് വിക്കറ്റിലേക്ക് എറിയുമ്പോൾ ബാറ്റ്സ്മാൻ ക്രീസിൽ കയറുന്നതിന് മുമ്പ് അത് പിടിച്ച് സ്റ്റംപ് ഇളക്കി റൺ ഔട്ടിൽ പങ്കാളിയാകാൻ വിക്കറ്റ് കീപ്പറിന് സാധിക്കും. വിക്കറ്റിന് പിറകിലേക്ക് പോകുന്ന പന്തുകളിൽ ബാറ്റ്സ്മാൻ റണ്ണിന് ശ്രമിച്ചാൽ പന്ത് തടഞ്ഞ്, ഗ്ലൗസ് ഊരിമാറ്റിയ ശേഷം പന്ത് സ്റ്റംപിലേക്ക് എറിഞ്ഞും ബാറ്റ്സ്മാനെ പുറത്താക്കാൻ വിക്കറ്റ് കീപ്പറിന് സാധിക്കും.

a shot that reaches the boundary after touching the ground, which scores four runs to the batting side.
Four wickets (also 4WI)
four or more wickets taken by a bowler in an innings, considered a good performance. Mostly used in One Day Internationals .
Fourth stump
a position or line one stump's width outside the off stump, i.e. where the wicket's fourth stump would be positioned if it existed. Generally used to describe the line or pitch of a delivery. A fourth stump line is roughly synonymous with the corridor of uncertainty. [25]
Free hit
a penalty given in some forms of cricket when a bowler bowls a front foot no-ball. The bowler must bowl another delivery, and the batsman cannot be dismissed by the bowler from thatial sector (and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster Channel 4 ), especially on satellite television, cable television, and digital television services.[ citation needed ]
In the late 1980s, the BBC began a process of divestment by spinning off and selling parts of its organisation. In 1988 it sold off the Hulton Press Library , a photographic archive which had been acquired from the Picture Post magazine by the BBC in 1957. The archive was sold to Brian Deutsch and is now owned by Getty Images . [34] During the 1990s, this process continued with the separation of certain operational arms of the corporation into autonomous but wholly owned subsidiaries of the BBC, with the aim of generating additional revenue for programme-making. BBC Enterprises was reorganised and relaunched in 1995 as BBC Worldwide Ltd. [31] In 1998, BBC studios, outside broadcasts, post production, design, costumes and wigs were spun off into BBC Resources Ltd. [35]
The BBC Research Department has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques. In the early days, it carried out essential research into acoustics and programme level and noise measurement.[ citation needed ] The BBC was also responsible for the development of the NICAM stereo standard.
In recent decades, a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched: Radio 5 was launched in 1990 as a sports and educational station, but was replaced in 1994 with Radio 5 Live , following the success of the Radio 4 service to cover the 1991 Gulf War. The new station would be a news and sport station. In 1997, BBC News 24 , a rolling news channel, launched on digital television services and the following year, BBC Choice launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed BBC Parliament . In 1999, BBC Knowledge launched as a multi media channel, with services available on the newly launched BBC Text digital teletext service, and on BBC Online . The channel had an educational aim, which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries.
2000 to 2011[ edit ]
In 2002, several television and radio channels were reorganised. BBC Knowledge was replaced by BBC Four and became the BBC's arts and documentaries channel. CBBC , which had been a programming strand as Children's BBC since 1985, was split into CBBC and CBeebies , for younger children, with both new services getting a digital channel: the CBBC Channel and CBeebies Channel. In addition to the television channels, new digital radio stations were created: 1Xtra , 6 Music and BBC7 . BBC 1Xtra was a sister station to Radio 1 and specialised in modern black music, BBC 6 Music specialised in alternative music genres and BBC7 specialised in archive, speech and children's programming.
The following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand: in 2003, BBC Choice was replaced by BBC Three , with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries, BBC News 24 became the BBC News Channel in 2008, and BBC Radio 7 became BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on Radio 4 . In 2008, another channel was launched, BBC Alba , a Scottish Gaelic service.
During this decade, the corporation began to sell off a number of its operational divisions to private owners; BBC Broadcast was spun off as a separate company in 2002, [36] and in 2005 it was sold off to Australian -based Macquarie Capital Alliance Group and Macquarie Bank Limited and rebranded Red Bee Media . [37] The BBC's IT , telephony and broadcast technology were brought together as BBC Technology Ltd in 2001, [36] and the division was later sold to the German engineering and electronics company Siemens IT Solutions and Services (SIS). [38] SIS was subsequently acquired from Siemens by the French company Atos . [39] Further divestments in this decade included BBC Books (sold to Random House in 2006); [40] BBC Outside Broadcasts Ltd (sold in 2008 to Satellite Information Services ); [41] Costumes and Wigs (sold in 2008 to Angels The Costumiers ); [42] and BBC Magazines (sold to Immediate Media Company in 2011). [43] After the sales of OBs and costumes, the remainder of BBC Resources was reorganised as BBC Studios and Post Production , which continues today as a wholly owned subsidiary of the BBC.
The 2004 Hutton Inquiry and the subsequent Report raised questions about the BBC's journalistic standards and its impartiality. This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General, Greg Dyke . In January 2007, the BBC released minutes of the Board meeting which led to Greg Dyke's resignation. [44]
Unlike the other departments of the BBC, the BBC World Service was funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, more commonly known as the Foreign Office or the FCO, is the British government department responsible for promoting the interests of the United Kingdom abroad.

In the past few years, the BBC has experimented in high-definition television . In 2006, BBC HD launched as an experimental service, and became official in December 2007. The channel broadcasts HD simulcasts of programmes on BBC One , BBC Two , BBC Three and BBC Four as well as repeats of some older programmes in HD. In 2010, a HD simulcast of BBC One launched: BBC One HD . The new channel uses HD versions of BBC One's schedule and uses upscaled versions of programmes not currently produced in HD.
On 18 October 2007, BBC Director General Mark Thompson announced a controversial plan to make major cuts and reduce the size of the BBC as an organisation. The plans included a reduction in posts of 2,500; including 1,800 redundancies, consolidating news operations, reducing programming output by 10% and selling off the flagship Television Centre building in London. [45] These plans have been fiercely opposed by unions, who have threatened a series of strikes, however the BBC have stated that the cuts are essential to move the organisation forward and concentrate on increasing the quality of programming.
On 20 October 2010, the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced that the television licence fee would be frozen at its current level until the end of the current charter in 2016. The same announcement revealed that the BBC would take on the full cost of running the BBC World Service and the BBC Monitoring service from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , and partially finance the Welsh broadcaster S4C . [46]
2011 to present[ edit ]
BBC New Broadcasting House, London which came into use during 2012–13.
Further cuts were announced on 6 October 2011, so the BBC could reach a total reduction in their budget of 20%, following the licence fee freeze in October 2010, details include cutting staff by 2000 and sending a further 1000 to the MediaCityUK development, with BBC Three moving in 2016, the sharing of more programmes between stations and channels, sharing of radio news bulletins, more repeats in schedules, including the whole of BBC Two daytime and for some original programming to be reduced. BBC HD was closed on 26 March 2013 and replaced with an HD simulcast of BBC Two, however flagship programmes, other channels and full funding for CBBC and CBeebies would be retained. [47] [48] [49] Numerous BBC facilities have been sold off, including New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road in Manchester. Many major departments have been relocated to Broadcasting House and MediaCityUK , particularly since the closure of BBC Television Centre in March 2013. The continued cuts have inspired campaigns, petitions and protests amongst the viewers and listeners of the BBC who are fiercely loyal to the sections of the BBC that they use. Websites like SaveBBC3 and SaveOurBBC have built a following of hundreds of thousands of individuals concerned about the changes.

Domnic Joseph Muthuswami (born 9 March 1981) is an Indian cricketer of Tamil descent who plays for Maharashtra cricket team in domestic cricket and Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League . He is a right-arm medium-fast bowler, who made his debut for Maharashtra at the age of 30. He worked in a bullet manufacturing company in Pune , before his bowling abilities were recognised while playing in the Industrial League. In 2011, he impressed the then Maharashtra coach Surendra Bhave and was selected in the Maharashtra Ranji squad later that year. [1] In 2015, he was bought by the IPL franchise Delhi Daredevils for Rs. 75 lakh at the players auction. [2] He made his IPL debut on 9 April 2015, playing for the Daredevils against the Chennai Super Kings .

Calculation summary[ edit ]
In the version of D/L most commonly in use in international and first class matches (the 'Professional Edition'), the target for the team batting second ('Team 2') is adjusted up or down from the total the team batting first ('Team 1') scored, in proportion to the two teams' resources (combination of overs and wickets available), i.e.
.
If, as usually occurs, this 'par score' is a non- integer number of runs, then Team 2's target to win is this number rounded up to the next integer, and the score to tie (also called the par score), is this number rounded down to the preceding integer. For example, if a rain delay means that Team 2 only has 90% of the resources that were available to Team 1, and Team 1 scored 254, then 254 x 90% = 228.6, so Team 2's target is 229, and the score to tie is 228. The actual resource values used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available, [3] so a computer must be used which has the software loaded.
If it's a 50-over match and Team 1 completed its innings uninterrupted, then they had 100% resource available to them, so the formula simplifies to:
.
Summary of impact on Team 2's target[ edit ]
If there is a delay before the first innings starts, so that the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then D/L will make no change to the target score. This is because both sides will be in the same position of having the same number of overs and 10 wickets available, and knowing this throughout their innings, so having the same amount of resource available.
Team 2's target score is first calculated once Team 1's innings has finished. If there were interruption(s) during Team 1's innings, or Team 1's innings was cut short, so that the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then (in the Professional Edition) D/L will adjust Team 2's target score as described above. The adjustment to Team 2's target after interruptions in Team 1's innings is often an increase, implying that Team 2 has more resource available than Team 1 had. Although both teams have 10 wickets and the same (reduced) number of overs available, an increase is fair as, for some of their innings, Team 1 thought they would have more overs available than they actually ended up having. They would have batted less conservatively, and scored more runs at the expense of more wickets, if they had known that their innings was going to be shorter than initially thought. They saved some wicket resource to use up in the overs that ended up being cancelled, which Team 2 doesn't need to do, therefore Team 2 has more resource to use in the same number of overs. Therefore, increasing Team 2's target score neutralizes the injustice done to Team 1 when they were denied some of the overs to bat they thought they would get.
If there are interruption(s) before or during the Team 2's innings, or Team 2's innings is cut short, then D/L will reduce Team 2's target score from the initial target set at the end of Team 1's innings, in proportion to the reduction in Team 2's resources. If there are multiple interruptions in the second innings, the target will be adjusted downwards each time.
If there are interruptions which both increase and decrease the target score, then the net effect on the target could be either an increase or decrease, depending on which interruptions were bigger.
Stoppage in first innings[ edit ]
Increased target
In the 4th India – England ODI in the 2008 series, the first innings was interrupted by rain on two occasions, resulting in the match being reduced to 22 overs each. India (batting first) made 166/4. England's target was set by the D/L method at 198 from 22 overs. As England knew they had only 22 overs the expectation is that they will be able to score more runs from those overs than India had from their (interrupted) innings. England made 178/8 from 22 overs, and so the match was listed as "India won by 19 runs (D/L method)". [4]
During the fifth ODI between India and South Africa in January 2011, rain halted play twice during the first innings. The match was reduced to 46 overs each and South Africa scored 250/9. The D/L method was applied which adjusted India's target to 268. As the number of overs was reduced during South Africa's innings, this method takes into account what South Africa are likely to have scored if they'd known throughout their innings that it would only be ining your temporary password, you can have a new password generated and emailed to you by filling out Wikipedia's password reset form.

Franchise history[ edit ]
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced in September 2007 the establishment of the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008. [4] In January 2008, the BCCI unveiled the owners of eight city-based franchises. The Mumbai franchise was sold to the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) for $111.9 million, making it the most expensive team in the league. [5] RIL, owned by Mukesh Ambani acquired the rights to the franchise for a period of 10 years. The franchise was eventually named "Mumbai Indians".
Team history[ edit ]
2008–2009: Struggle in the initial seasons[ edit ]
The Indian Premier League named four players as icon players for their respective city franchises which made the players unavailable to play for any team other than their city team. Sachin Tendulkar was named Mumbai's icon player. The icon player was also entitled to earn 15% more than the next-best paid player in their team. At first player auctions for the inaugural IPL season conducted in February 2008, the Mumbai franchise bought several star international cricketers such as Sanath Jayasuriya , Harbhajan Singh , Shaun Pollock , Lasith Malinga and Robin Uthappa . [6] The franchise named Sachin Tendulkar as the captain of the team and appointed former India cricketer Lalchand Rajput as the head coach. However, Tendulkar was injured before the start of the 2008 season due to which Harbhajan Singh took over as the captain in the initial stage of the season. The team got off to a bad start in the season losing their first four games by some comprehensive margins. Their first match was a five-wicket defeat to the Royal Challengers Bangalore on 20 April 2008 at the Wankhede . Their stand-in captain, Harbhajan, was suspended from the tournament for reportedly slapping Sreesanth during Mumbai's league match against Kings XI Punjab . After Harbhajan's suspension, Shaun Pollock assumed the leadership duties until Tendulkar's return on 24 May. Under Pollock's captaincy, Mumbai won six out of their next six games which left them needing to win two more out of the remaining four matches to qualify for the semifinals. Mumbai suffered three last-over defeats in the next three games, including two off the last ball, before winning their last league match. They finished fifth in the points table with 7 wins and 7 losses, missing out on a semifinal spot by just one point. [7]
The 2009 season was played in South Africa as it coincided with multi-phase 2009 Indian general elections due to which the Government of India refused to commit the Indian paramilitary forces to provide security for the IPL. Before the start of the season, Mumbai Indians traded Robin Uthappa for Zaheer Khan with Royal Challengers Bangalore, and Ashish Nehra for Shikhar Dhawan with the Delhi Daredevils . Shaun Pollock retired after the first season and became the head coach of the team. Lasith Malinga , who missed the previous season due to an injury, returned to the team. At the player auction , Mumbai bought South African batsman JP Duminy to strengthen their batting department. After winning their opening match against the Chennai Super Kings , Mumbai struggled to put up consistent performances during the season. They relied heavily on Duminy and Tendulkar's batting, and Malinga's bowling along with minimal contributions from other players. With only five wins from 14 matches, Mumbai finished on seventh place in the league table.
2010–2012: Rise as a strong team[ edit ]
Lasith Malinga is the leading wicket-taker in IPL with 143 wickets since its inception.
At the 2010 players auction , Mumbai Indians bought Trinidadian all-rounder Kieron Pollard for $750,000 following a secret tie-breaker. After the auction, they signed up ten uncapped Indian players out whom seven were former ICL players. Former India cricketer Robin Singh was named as the head coach of the team as Pollock took up the role of bowling coach. Mumbai had to shift their home venue to Brabourne Stadium for the season since the Wankhede was undergoing renovation to host some matches of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup . Mumbai won seven of their first eight games to take the top spot in the points table. Their success was mainly due to the efforts of Tendulkar, Malinga, Harbhajan, Ambati Rayudu and Saurabh Tiwary . They won three of the remaining six league games and finished with 20 points from 14 games at the top of the points table. They beat the Royal Challengers Bangalore by 35 runs in the semifinal, thanks to Pollard's all-round efforts (33* from 13 balls, and 3/17). At the final, they were defeated by the Chennai Super Kings by 22 runs. The Mumbai team management was criticised for the "strategic errors" during the final such as sending Abhishek Nayar and Harbhajan at batting positions 3 and 4 respectively while Duminy and Pollard were sent at 7 and 8. Mumbai skipper Sachin Tendulkar, who scored 618 runs at an average of 47.53 and strike rate of 132.6, won the Orange Cap for scoring most runs in the season. Mumbai qualified for the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 where they were eliminated in the group stage with two wins and two defeats in four matches.
In 2011 , with the addition of two new teams to the IPL, the IPL Governing Council declared that each franchise could retain a maximum of four players of their 2010 squad, and the rest of the international players would be auctioned. Mumbai Indians retained Tendulkar, Harbhajan, Pollard and Malinga for a sum of $4.5 million. This retention left the franchise with the power of spending $4.5 million at the auction where they purchased Indian batsman Rohit Sharma for $2 million, former Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds for $850,000, and pacer Munaf Patel for $700,000. Mumbai won eight of their first ten league games following which they suffered a loss of form that led to three consecutive defeats and a last-ball win in their last league match. They finished third on the points table with 18 points from 14 games and qualified for the Eliminator. The Eliminator was played at the Wankhede where Mumbai faced the Kolkata Knight Riders . After winning the toss and electing to bowl first, Mumbai restricted Kolkata to 147 in 20 overs and chased down the target for the loss of six wickets with four balls to spare. Munaf Patel won the Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 3/27. With this win, Mumbai qualified for the Qualifying final against Royal Challengers Bangalore, the winner of which would play the Super Kings in the final. Mumbai skipper Tendulkar won the toss once again and put their opposition into bat who set Mumbai a target of 186. Mumbai kept losing wickets at regular intervals from the start of their innings and could score only 142/8, falling short by 43 runs. The top two leading wicket-takers of the season were Mumbai Indians pacers Lasith Malinga and Munaf Patel with 28 and 22 wickets respectively.
Mumbai qualified for the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 held in India. Before the start of the tournament, six first-choice Indian players in the Mumbai squad including Tendulkar, Sharma and Patel were ruled out of the tournament due to injuries and two more Indian players were ruled out based on medical reports. This left their 14-member squad with only six Indian players, while the tournament allowed a maximum of four overseas players and minimum of seven local players in the playing eleven. An exception was made for the Mumbai Indians which permitted them to field five overseas players during the tournament. Harbhajan was named the stand-in captain in the absence of Tendulkar. Mumbai were placed in Group A alongside Chennai Super Kings, New South Wales Blues , Cape Cobras and Trinidad & Tobago . Mumbai had two wins, one defeat and one no result in the group stage which gave them the second place on the group points table with five points. They qualified for the semifinal and Mumbai batsman Suryakumar Yadav returned to the squad after recovering from his injury. This led to the withdrawal of the concession given by the Champions League for the Mumbai Indians to field five overseas players. Mumbai faced Somerset County Cricket Club in the semifinal at Chennai. Batting first, Mumbai made 160/5 in 20 overs. Somerset's chase was dented by Malinga who picked four wickets for 20 (all bowled ) to help Mumbai restrict Somerset to 150 and win the match by 10 runs. The final was also played in Chennai where Mumbai met Royal Challengers Bangalore. Mumbai batted first and managed only 139 in 20 overs. Bangalore started strongly in the run-chase putting 38 for the first wicket before Malinga broke the partnership. Harbhajan then picked up the key wickets of Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli triggering a batting collapse and eventually Bangalore were bowled out for 108, giving Mumbai a 31-run victory and their first-ever title. Harbahajan was named player of the match and Malinga won the man of the tournament award. Andrew Symonds retired from all forms of cricket in early-2012.
Before the start of the 2012 season , the Mumbai Indians traded Dinesh Karthik from Kings XI Punjab and Pragyan Ojha from the Deccan Chargers for undisclosed sums. At the auction , the franchise bought five players including R. P. Singh , Thisara Perera (both for $600,000) and Mitchell Johnson . Tendulkar stepped down from captaincy hours before the season's first game following which Harbhajan was appointed as the captain. In the first half of the league stage, Mumbai had four wins and four defeats, including three losses at home. Mumbai did not have a fixed opening combination, with Tendulkar missing out four matches due to an injury and other opening batsmen failing to show consistency. Johnson was ruled out of rest of the season in late-April with an injury and Dwayne Smith was named his replacement in the squad. Mumbai fared better in the second half of the league stage, winning six of their eight matches. They finished third on the points table with 20 points from 16 matches and qualified for the Eliminator against the fourth-placed Chennai Super Kings at Bangalore. Mumbai won the toss and put Chennai in to bat first. After losing two wickets inside the first two overs, Chennai managed to put up 187/5 in 20 overs mainly because of their captain MS Dhoni 's unbeaten 20-ball 51. Mumbai's chase had started solidly with the score reading 47/0 in the fifth over, before they started losing wickets at regular intervals to end at 149/9 and lose the match by 38 runs. They gained direct qualification to the 2012 Champions League Twenty20 in South Africa, along with the three IPL teams that finished at the top that season. Mumbai, placed in Group B, were winless in the tournament with three defeats and one no result.
2013–present: Success and comebacks[ edit ]
Rohit Sharma became the captain of Mumbai Indians in 2013 and has since led them to two IPL titles.
The 2013 IPL saw Anil Kumble being appointed as the chief mentor, after he quit a similar position from Royal Challengers Bangalore . With a slump in batting form of Ricky Ponting , he was eventually dropped from the playing eleven and Rohit Sharma took lead of the team. Having the experienced advice of the likes of Anil Kumble, Jonty Rhodes and Sachin Tendulkar, the team emerged victorious in IPL 2013.
In the year 2013 Mumbai Indians started off by losing against the Royal Challengers Bangalore because of the efforts of Chris Gayle and pace bowler Vinay Kumar but they were able to make a comeback in that match because of Dinesh Karthik due to which Mumbai lost by just one run. In the second match against the Chennai Super Kings the openers went off cheaply but because of the efforts of Dinesh Karthik and Kieron Pollard Mumbai had put a defend able score on the board. The Mumbai Indians bowlers started off well by dismissing Murali Vijay cheaply and the match went off till the last over with the Super Kings needing 16 off the last over with MS Dhoni on strike and Munaf Patel to bowl; Patel dismissed Dhoni on the first ball and Mumbai won the match comfortably by 9 runs. In their third match against the Delhi Daredevils Mumbai once again lost their openers Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar cheaply and this time it was again Dinesh Karthik who brought the match in Mumbai's grasp but,this time it was not Kieron Pollard but it was Rohit Sharma with him which helped the Mumbai Indians reach the formidable score of 209/5. At one stage it looked that David Warner would snatch the game away from Mumbai but the Mumbai Indians bowlers got rid of David Warner by dismissing him and then the Delhi Daredevils collapsed due to which Mumbai Indians won comfortably by 44 runs. In the next match against the Pune Warriors India Mumbai got off to a flying start with a 54-run opening stand between the Pon-dulkar(Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar) and then it was followed by Rohit Sharma due to which Mumbai scored 183/3 and won the match comfortably by 41 runs. In the next match against the Rajasthan Royals Mumbai were bundled out for just 92 giving the Rajasthan Royals an 83-run victory due to which Ricky Ponting stepped down as a captain and retired from all forms of cricket. With Rohit Sharma in good batting form, he was made the captain. Under his captaincy the Mumbai Indians improved a lot and won their first IPL title.
They continued the victory streak in the Champions League. But in the Champions league too they had quite slow start which saw them having to win their final match of the league stage against the Perth Scorchers by a margin; this they did it by the combined efforts of Nathan Coulter-Nile , Dwayne Smith and skipper Rohit Sharma . In the final Glenn Maxwell scored a quick fire 14-ball 37 enablingh Mumbai to post a total of 202/6 and woi the match comfortably by 33 runs.
In 2014 Mumbai didn't start off well losing 5 of their matches in the UAE leg against Kolkata Knight Riders , Royal Challengers Bangalore , Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils by big margins but did well in their 5th match against Sunrisers Hyderabad but consequently lost the matches against respective opponents.
In the Indian leg they made a comeback by beating Kings XI Punjab who were at the top of the table at that time. After that they were inconsistent with their performance. They won against Royal Challengers Bangalore but lost against Chennai Super Kings . They won against the Sunrisers Hyderabad and again lost against Kolkata Knight Riders . But after losing against the Kolkata Knight Riders they won against Kings XI Punjab and the Delhi Daredevils respectively.
In the match against Kings XI Punjab , Lendl Simmons scored a hundred due to which they won comfortably by seven wickets.
In the match against Rajasthan Royals they needed to score 190 runs in 14.3 overs while chasing but they just managed a tie with the Rajasthan Royals in 14.3 overs so they needed a boundary of the next ball and Aditya Tare hit a six to a full toss bowled by James Faulkner . Due to that six they reached the eliminator stage of the IPL but lost against the Chennai Super Kings which ended their IPL campaign of 2014.
The Mumbai Indians qualified in the qualifier round of the clt20 2014. Due to injury to their skipper Rohit Sharma , Kieron Pollard was named as their captain.
In the first match they faced the first the fbt20 2014 champions Lahore Lions but they lost against them with Lahore Lions winning by 6 wickets in 18.4 overs. In the second match they faced the Southern Express . Southern Express had a slow start and lost wickets regularly but somehow managed to score 161/6 in 20 overs. The Mumbai Indians started off with an excellent opening partnership of 139 runs in just 14 overs but lost their first wicket on the 4th ball of the 15th over but skipper Kieron Pollard ended things off in blistering way with scoring 20 runs from just 7 balls. But in the last match against the Northern Knights they just managed 132 runs which the Northern Knights won comfortably 6 wickets with 16 balls to spare. In this way Mumbai's clt20 2014 campaign ended.
Mumbai Indians won their second IPL title in 2015 after they defeated Chennai Super Kings by 41 runs. They started the season with 4 IPL defeats mainly due to their bowling. They even lost Aaron Finch and Corey Anderson due to injury for the rest of the season. That is when Lendl Simmons got a chance back into the team and with the help of 6 half-centuries, gave the team solid starts throughout the season. He was the top scorer for Mumbai with 540 runs and joint second (with Ajinkya Rahane ) in total for the season behind David Warner. The introduction of another strike bowler Mitchell McClenaghan in the team provided good support to Lasith Malinga upfront. Mumbai then went on to win 9 out of their last 10 Matches to win the title thanks to solid batting performances from Simmons, Rohit Sharma, Ambati Rayudu and Kieron Pollard and good bowling from Malinga, McClenaghan and Harbhajan Singh .
Home ground[ edit ]
Wankhede Stadium in April 2011 during the World Cup final.
The Mumbai Indians play their home games at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The stadium is named after former BCCI President S. K. Wankhede . The stadium is owned by the Mumbai Cricket Association and has a seating capacity of more than 30,000. In 2010, the Mumbai Indians played all seven home games at the Brabourne Stadium while the Wankhede Stadium underwent renovation for hosting a few matches of group stage as well as the final of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup . Mumbai Indians won six out of the seven matches at the Brabourne Stadium that season.

Edit summary
(Briefly describe your changes)
By clicking the "Save page" button, you agree to the Term delivery. Between the no-ball and the free hit, the fielders may not change positions (unless the batsmen changed ends on the no-ball).
an informal form of the game. The term "playing French Cricket" can mean that a batsman has not moved his feet and looks ungainly because of this.
French Cut (also Chinese Cut, Surrey Cut, or Harrow Drive)
terms for any poorly executed shot which results in an inside edge which narrowly misses hitting the stumps. [17]
Fritz
To be out stumped following a rebound from the wicketkeeper's pads on to the stumps.
Front foot
in a batsman's stance the front foot is the foot that is nearer to the bowler. A bowler's front foot is the last foot to contact the ground before the ball is released.
is the position of the bowler at the moment when his front foot lands on the ground just prior to delivering the ball.
Front-foot shot
a shot played with the batsman's weight on his front foot (i.e. the foot nearest the bowler).
Fruit Salad
when a bowler delivers a different type of delivery each time, rather than bowling a constant speed, length and angle. Fruit salad bowling is used most commonly in Twenty20 to prevent batsmen from getting comfortable.
Full length
a delivery that pitches closer to the batsman than a ball pitching on a good length, but further away than a half-volley.
Full toss (also full bunger)
a delivery that reaches the batsman on the full, i.e. without bouncing. Usually considered a bad delivery to bowl as the batsman has a lot of time to see the ball and play an attacking shot. Also, it does not have a chance to change direction off the ground, making it the ultimate crime for a spin or seam bowler. [1] [3]
Furniture
G[ edit ]
Gardening
a batsman prodding at the pitch with his bat between deliveries, either to flatten a bump in the pitch, to soothe his own frazzled nerves or simply to waste time or upset the rhythm of the bowler. Considered facetious as there is not really a point to it. [1] [3]
Getting one's eye in
when the batsman takes his time to assess the condition of the pitch, ball or weather etc before starting to attempt more potentially risky strokes.
Given man
given men were players in the early history of cricket who did not normally play for a particular side but were included, for a particular fixture, to strengthen it. Early first-class matches were usually the subject of big wagers and it was therefore desirable that the two sides should be perceived as being of roughly equal strength. The concept is similar to that of handicapping in modern-day horse racing, whereby horses carry different weights in an attempt to equalise their chances of winning, again to encourage betting.
Glance
the shot played very fine behind the batsman on the leg side. A glance is typically played on a short-pitched ball. [8] See also flick.
Glove
part of a batsman's kit worn to protect the hands from accidental injury. When a hand is in contact with the bat it is considered part of the bat and so a player can be given out caught to a ball that came off the glove hence "gloved a catch."
Glovemanship (also Gauntlet work)
the art of wicketkeeping. e.g. 'A marvellous display of glovemanship from the wicketkeeper.'
Golden duck
a dismissal for nought (zero), from the first ball faced in a batsman's innings. ( cf Duck, Diamond duck, Platinum duck )
Golden pair (also King pair)
a dismissal for nought (zero) runs off the first ball faced in each of a batsman's two innings of a two-innings match (see this list of Pairs in test and first class cricket ).
Good length
the ideal place for a stock delivery to pitch in its trajectory from the bowler to the batsman. It makes the batsman uncertain whether to play a front-foot or back-foot shot. A good length differs from bowler to bowler, based on the type, height and speed of the bowler. The "good length" is not necessarily the best length to bowl, as a bowler may wish to bowl short or full to exploit a batsman's weaknesses. [1]
Googly (also wrong'un or bosie)
a deceptive spinning delivery by a leg spin bowler which spins the opposite direction to the stock delivery. For a right-hander bowler and a right-handed batsman, a googly will turn from the off side to the leg side. Developed by Bosanquet around 1900. [1] [3]
Gouging
causing intentional damage to the pitch or ball.
Gozza
Out first ball. See Golden duck.
Grafting
batting defensively with strong emphasis on not getting out, often under difficult conditions.
Green top
a pitch with an unusually high amount of visible grass, that might be expected to assist the pace bowlers.
Grip
the rubber casings used on the handle of the bat; alternatively, how the bowler holds the ball and how the batsman holds the bat.
Ground, v
to turn and touch the bat onto the ground surface behind the popping crease after the batsman has left the crease in the action of taking a shot or starting a run; to run the bat in the process of completing a run in order to be safe.
Ground, n
the batsman's safe area on the pitch. The batsman is said to be in his/her ground when a part of the body (usually the foot) or the bat is touching the ground surface behind the popping crease. The batsmen is said to have left his/her ground when he/she advances down the pitch in the action of taking a shot or has started a run. The batsman is said to have made his/her ground if able to ground his/her bat or touch the ground surface behind the popping crease with a part of the body before a fielder can break the wicket.
Groundsman (or curator)
a person responsible for maintaining the cricket field and preparing the pitch. [6]
Grubber
a delivery that barely bounces. [1]
(Taking) guard
the batsman aligning his bat according with a stump (or between stumps) chosen behind him. Typically, the batsman marks the position of the bat on the pitch. The marking(s) give the batter an idea as to where he or she is standing in relation to the stumps. [6]

At the end of the 2008 season , O'Brien was named Northamptonshire's player of the year and was rewarded for his consistent performances with a three-year contract with the club. A representative of Northamptonshire CCC said "Niall, who has just returned from international duty, was in sensational form last season with the bat, scoring over 850 championship runs and piling on the runs in one-day competitions in a new pinch-hitter role". [15] In a tour match against Australia during the 2009 Ashes in July 2009, O'Brien made scores of 30 and 58 in a match Northamptonshire lost. During his half century, he scored seven boundaries off the struggling Mitchell Johnson . [16]
O'Brien was one of seven Ireland players to be nominated for the 2009 Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year (there were fourteen nominees in all), [17] although he did not make the 4-man short-list. [18] O'Brien was selected in Ireland's 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup . [19]
O'Brien missed most of the 2010 season after undergoing finger surgery in July; in his absence, David Murphy was Northamptonshire's first-choice wicket-keeper. [20]
O'Brien keeping wicket against Pakistan during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 .
O'Brien set a World Twenty20 record with his 4 dismissals against Sri Lanka in the Super 8 stage of the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 . O'Brien was selected in Ireland's 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup to be hosted by Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka between February and April. [21] During the tournament he became the third player to score 1,000 ODI runs for Ireland after William Porterfield and his brother Kevin. [22] He passed this landmark in Ireland's five-wicket defeat to India. In the same match, O'Brien and Porterfield established a new records for Ireland's third wicket in ODI, putting on 113 runs together. [23] Ireland were due to play two ODIs against Pakistan in May, however O'Brien sufrnment intervention, with its activities being overseen by the BBC Trust (formerly the Board of Governors ). [50] General management of the organisation is in the hands of a Director-General, who is appointed by the Trust; he is the BBC's Editor-in-Chief and chairs the Executive Board. [51]
Charter[ edit ]
The BBC operates under a Royal Charter . [9] The current Charter came into effect on 1 January 2007 and runs until 31 December 2016. [52] Each successive Royal Charter is reviewed before a new one is granted, i.e. every 10 years.
The 2007 Charter specifies that the mission of the Corporation is to "inform, educate and entertain". It states that the Corporation exists to serve the public interest and to promote its public purposes: sustaining citizenship and civil society, promoting education and learning, stimulating creativity and cultural excellence, representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities, bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK, helping to deliver to the public the benefit of emerging communications technologies and services, and taking a leading role in the switchover to digital television .
The 2007 Charter made the largest change in the governance of the Corporation since its inception. It abolished the sometimes controversial governing body, the Board of Governors , replacing it with the sometimes controversial BBC Trust and a formalised Executive Board.
Under the Royal Charter, the BBC must obtain a licence from the Home Secretary . [53] This licence is accompanied by an agreement which sets the terms and conditions under which BBC is allowed to broadcast. [53] It was under this Licence and Agreement (and the Broadcasting Act 1981 ) that the Sinn Féin broadcast ban from 1988 to 1994 was implemented. [54] [55]
Main article: BBC Trust
The BBC Trust was formed on 1 January 2007, replacing the Board of Governors as the governing body of the Corporation. The Trust sets the strategy for the corporation, assesses the performance of the BBC Executive Board in delivering the BBC's services, and appoints the Director-General.



Zapobieganie bye[ edytuj | edytuj kod ]
Jeśli batsman drużyny przeciwnej nie trafi w piłkę, a ta nie zbije wicketa , wicket-keeper musi ją złapać. Jeśli nie złapie, batsman może zdecydować się na wykonanie runa i wtedy może zdobyć run na podstawie bye (nie dolicza mu się do indywidualnego wyniku, ale dolicza do sumy runów drużyny). Za wicket-keeperem rzadko stoją inni gracze z pola, więc batsman ma czas na wykonanie runa. Jeśli piłka dotoczy się do granicy boiska (boundary), drużyna zdobywa automatycznie 4 runy, podobnie jak przy wybiciu piłki do granicy za pomocą kija [1] .
Eliminowanie batsmanów[ edytuj | edytuj kod ]
Wicket-keeper ma też za zadanie eliminować batsmanów. Najczęstszym sposobem eliminowania jest caught (wyłapany), kiedy batsman muśnie piłkę kijem (tzw. edge) a ta nie dotykając ziemi trafi w ręce wicket-keepera, batsman jest wyautowany. Wicket-keeperzy mają największą statystykę caught spośród wszystkich graczy z pola. Drugą metodą, rzadszą, jest eliminacja poprzez stumped , która następuje gdy batsman nie trafi w piłkę, a podczas próby odbicia opuści przez przypadek swój crease (bezpieczną strefę). Wtedy wicket-keeper (jeśli złapie piłkę) może zbić ręką lub piłką wicket batsmana i batsman jest wyautowany poprzez stumped.
Wicket-keeper jest również zwykłym graczem z pola i dlatego może eliminować batsmanów również poprzez run out, gdy np. batsman odbije piłkę na leg side, nie ma tam graczy z pola, a wicket-keeper pobiegnie za piłką i rzuci nią w stronę wicketa, i jeśli go zbije zanim batsman znajdzie się w bezpiecznej strefie, wtedy batsman wylatuje poprzez run out. Wicket-keeper jest również w najlepszej pozycji (blisko wicketa) do złapania piłki rzuconej od gracza z pola, wtedy wicket-keeper łapiąc taką piłkę ma możliwość wyeliminowania batsmana poprzez run out (jeśli nie jest w bezpiecznej strefie).
Sprzęt[ edytuj | edytuj kod ]
Wicket-keeper jako jedyny gracz z pola nosi ochraniacze na zewnątrz ubrania (gracze na pozycjach silly też mogą je nosić, ale pod ubraniem). Wicket-keeperzy noszą ochraniacze na piszczele i kolana oraz na krocze. Używają jako jedyni pogrubionych rękawic do łapania (gracze na pozycjach silly nie mogą). Jeśli chcą, mogą również używać kasku, ale większość graczy profesjonalnych tego nie robi, gdyż hełm ogranicza widoczność, a piłkę lecącą na twarz zawodowi wicket-keeperzy powinni łapać bez problemu (choć przy okazji rzutów fast bowlerów miotających piłki z prędkością ponad 130 km/h nieraz zakładają kaski) [2] .
Ogólne wymagania[ edytuj | edytuj kod ]
Od wicket-keepera w nowoczesnym krykiecie zazwyczaj wymaga się również dobrego wyszkolenia na pozycji batsmana (do takiego stopnia, aby przynajmniej odbijał jako middle-order batsman). Wicket-keeperzy odbijający na pozycji opening batsmana (odbijającego na początku inningsa ) są znani jako all-rounderzy (keeper/batsman).
Wicket-keeperzy mają jednak prawa do zdjęcia ochraniaczy i bowlowania . Dwóch wicket-keeperów w historii pierwszoklasowego krykieta zdobyło hat-tricki (eliminując w trzech kolejnych rzutach, trzech batsmanów przeciwnika)
Kontuzje i zmiany[ edytuj | edytuj kod ]
Zgodnie z przepisem drugim zasad krykieta, kontuzjowany lub chory wicket-keeper nie może zostać zmieniony w trakcie meczu przez zawodnika rezerwowego (może go zmienić tylko gracz znajdujący się na polu od początku meczu), chociaż za zgodą kapitanów obu ekip można odstąpić od tej zasady. Postąpiono tak np. w przypadku 45-letniego Boba Taylora, którego ściągnięto na boisko z namiotu sponsorów (łapał przez 73 overy) [3]

Wasim Bari ( Urdu : وسیم باری) (born 23 March 1948, Karachi , Sindh ) is a former Pakistani cricketer who played in 81 Tests and 51 ODIs from 1967 to 1984. Bari was a wicket-keeper and right-handed batsman. At the end of his 17-year career he was the most capped player in Pakistani Test history.
His talent was first recognised in 1967 with members of the England under 25 team stating that he was the best keeper to come out of the South Asia. It was in England where he made his Test debut, with Colin Milburn being his first dismissal. With the bat he only managed 15.88 per innings in his career but played some famous innings for Pakistan. There were none more famous than his unbeaten 60 from number 11, in which he made a last wicket partnership of 133 with Wasim Raja .
According to Tony Greig, commentator and former England captain, most people believe Alan Knott was the best wicket-keeper to have played the game in that era but Knott himself believed Bari was better than him.
Keeping records[ edit ]
In 1971 at Leeds, he equalled the then world record of 8 catches in a Test match. He was in the record books again in 1976/77 by stumping 4 batsmen in a Test, against the Australians. In 1979 against New Zealand he caught 7 of the first 8 batsmen, creating a world record for most dismissals in a Test innings. He finished his career with 228 Test victims, the most by a Pakistani and to this day the most by a South Asian keeper.

Alan Philip Eric Knott (born 9 April 1946 in Belvedere, Kent ), [1] is a former Kent County Cricket Club and English cricketer , as a wicket-keeper - batsman .
Knott was educated at Northumberland Heath Secondary Modern School. He played for the England Test side between 1967 and 1981, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1970. He was particularly known for his habit of conducting limbering-up exercises at any inactive moment during a match. His major strengths as a batsman were the sweep and the cut .
On 6 September 2009, Alan Knott was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame , [2] and in 2013 he was named in Wisden's all-time Test World XI. [3]
Career[ edit ]
Inspired by his father, he made his Kent debut in 1964 at the age of 18. He joined a long list of Kent-created wicket-keeper-batsmen.
He gained his first Test cap at the age of 21, having been named Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year in 1965. When he made his debut, it was against the Pakistani tourists in 1967. Batting at number 8, he made a duck in his first Test, at Trent Bridge , but didn't concede a single bye in the match. He made 28 in the second match, but didn't make the starting eleven for the 1967–68 tour of the West Indies , as Jim Parks was initially preferred. However, for the fourth and fifth matches of the series, he was picked again. In the first of those, he made his first Test half-century, a score of 69 not out, and he once again excelled at wicket-keeping.
In the winter of 1968/69, again against Pakistan, he confirmed his position as England's premier wicketkeeper-batsman. He made two 50s in the series, including a score of 96 not out at Karachi when the match was prematurely ended by a pitch invasion by Pakistani fans, denying him a well-deserved hundred.
In 1970, he was Wisden's Cricketer of the Year. County captain Colin Cowdrey said:
I think he is the most gifted and dedicated cricketer one could ever wish to play with, never satisfied with his performance and always seeking for a little more perfection.
In the 1970–71 series in Australia he was instrumental in England regaining The Ashes , taking five catches and stumping Doug Walters in the decisive Seventh Test in Sydney . In the following series against New Zealand he finally made his maiden Test century, 110 at Auckland , having missed the first match of the series, so that Bob Taylor could take the gloves as a reward for patience as reserve keeper on the four-month combined tour. Knott did not miss a Test until 1977, making a sum of five centuries and twenty-eight 50s in that time.
He has the distinction of once scoring 7 runs from a single delivery in Test cricket, off Vanburn Holder in the Fourth England v West Indies Test at Headingley in 1976. Knott took a quick single to extra-cover where Bernard Julien fielded and overthrew the wicket-keeper. Knott and Tony Greig ran two overthrows before Andy Roberts , fielding at square-leg, retrieved the ball and threw it past the stumps at the bowler's end and over the long-off boundary for four more runs.
Knott helped England win the Ashes in England in 1977 but had been persuaded by England colleague Tony Greig to join Kerry Packer 's World Series Cricket . This effectively put his England career on hold as the 'Packer players' were banned from Test cricket. When he returned to Tests after the end of World Series Cricket in 1980, he had very little success against a mighty West Indian side, averaging 5.14 in the series. He did not play in the tour of the West Indies that immediately followed, but was picked for the final two Tests of the famous 1981 Ashes series. Fittingly for one of England's greatest players, he ended his last Test against Australia at The Oval , with a score of 70 not out and an England series win.
He was replaced as England wicket keeper by Bob Taylor on two occasions – when he went to World Series Cricket, and when he retired. Knott retired from all cricket in 1985, at the age of 39. He then mentored his son James Knott and Jack Russell .
Knott was known for his idiosyncratic behaviour on the field. His trademarks included always keeping his shirt collar turned up to protect him from the sun; his sleeves rolled down to safeguard his elbows when diving; and, after a tip from former Northamptonshire and England wicket-keeper Keith Andrew , warming his hands with hot water before going on the field. According to Bob Taylor, Knott preferred strong-backed gloves with full webbing and plenty of padding in the palms, wearing two pairs of Chamois inners with strips of plasticine across the palms. [4]
He now lives in Cyprus . [5] [6]
In the October 2004 edition of The Wisden Cricketer magazine he was voted as the wicket-keeper in "England's Greatest post-war XI" receiving votes from 20 of the 25 panellists.



Early life[ edit ]
Ali is Muslim, of Pakistani descent , and was born in Birmingham. [2] He belongs to the Mirpuri community ; his grandfather migrated to England from Mirpur, Azad Kashmir and married an Englishwoman. [3] [4] He can understand Urdu and Punjabi . [5]
Warwickshire[ edit ]
Ali signed for Warwickshire aged just 15, hitting a half-century for the county's Second XI a few days before his 16th birthday. [6] After more games at this level in 2004, and a first outing for England Under-19s against their Bangladeshi counterparts he spent the succeeding winter playing for the Under-19s on their tour of India.
2005 saw Ali make his first-class debut, against Cambridge University in May. He impressed with the bat, making 57 not out in his only innings, and sent down two overs for 15 runs. Playing that summer against Sri Lankan Under-19s , he starred in the final "Test" by making 52 not out and 100 not out (the latter innings from 56 balls) and claiming seven wickets. He was then selected for the 2006 Under-19 Cricket World Cup , which was held in Sri Lanka , and was immediately promoted to captain by coach Andy Pick . He made three half-centuries in the tournament, and took seven wickets.
Ali received additional opportunities for his county in 2006, playing his first List A games. The first of these came against Derbyshire , where he dismissed Steffan Jones to claim his maiden first-team wicket. He also took his first wickets in first-class cricket, and his first three victims were all Test players: Stuart Law , Dominic Cork and Dave Mohammed . With the bat he scored 68 on his County Championship debut against Nottinghamshire , then equalled that score against Durham .
Ali's opportunities were somewhat limited, however, and Alex Loudon took his place in the side. In July 2006, with the expiry of his Warwickshire contract only months away, Ali brushed off rumours of a move to Worcestershire, saying "I don't know anything about it", [7] but in September it was announced that Ali would indeed be leaving to join that county. The player himself said that he had been impressed by Worcestershire and felt it gave him the best prospects of furthering his career. [8]
Worcestershire[ edit ]
He made his debut for Worcestershire in their ten-wicket win over Loughborough UCCE on 25 April 2007, but had a rather poor game, returning 0–92 off 16 overs and being dismissed for 12 in his only innings.
Ali's highest first-class score of 250, scored against Glamorgan at New Road, featured a partnership of 219 with Matt Pardoe. [9]
At the end of the 2010 season Worcestershire secured promotion to the first division of the County Championship. [10] After he was overlooked by the England Lions and England Performance Programme at the end of the 2010 English season, Moeen opted to play club cricket in Bangladesh at the suggestion of Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan . Shakib played for Worcestershire as their overseas player in 2010 and the link with the club led to Moeen representing Mohammedan Sporting Club in the Ispahani Premier Division. [11]
2011 Season[ edit ]
During the 2011 season Moeen spent three weeks as Worcestershire's acting captain wuniya Hila Denge Hum", which translates to We will rock the world. [10] The first anthem of Mumbai Indian was based on this motto, wherein the Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan was roped in for a promotional video campaign. [11]
The team logo is a Razor as initially the name of the team was supposed to be "Mumbai Razors" before Sachin Tendulkar suggested to keep it Mumbai Indians.
Jersey colors[ edit ]
The team's primary color is blue with silver stripes on either sides of the jersey. The team colours was almost the same in 2008 and 2009, with Idea as the principal sponsor, except for the colour shade and additional sponsors. In 2010, a new kit with golden stripes was unveiled. In 2011, kit used in 2010 is being used with Hero Honda as the main sponsor. The 2011 jersey also has three gold stripes going towards the back on the side of the jersey for the new players in the team. The kit manufacturer was Adidas from the start of IPL in 2008 till 2014. [12] In 2015, Performax, an in-house brand of Reliance Trends, replaced Adidas as the kit manufacturer.
Theme song[ edit ]
The current theme song of the Mumbai Indians is the famous Ala Re. However, after every boundary or a wicket by the team, a fan-made music titled "Akkha Mumbai Khelega" is always played by the stadium disc jockey .
Players[ edit ]
During the player auction in 2008, the Mumbai Indians successfully bid for 7 players, including two members of the Indian Twenty-20 World cup winning side in Harbhajan Singh , Robin Uthappa . Sanath Jayasuriya , Lasith Malinga , Luke Ronchi , Dilhara Fernando and Shaun Pollock were other cricketers who were successfully bid for by the franchise. [13]
Outside of the player auction, the franchise also signed up Ajinkya Rahane and Abhishek Nayar (from Mumbai), Yogesh Takawale (WK-Batsman from Maharashtra) and Pinal Shah (WK-Batsman from Baroda). [14] Saurabh Tiwary and Manish Pandey , the members of the U-19 world-cup winning team were the random picks drafted in during the BCCI held second auction. Dominic Thornely was also signed by the Mumbai Indians for a sum of $30,000. André Nel the South African fast bowler was signed on in the place of Dwayne Bravo who left the tournament early. [15]
In the 2009 player auction,the Mumbai Indians signed up South African player, JP Duminy for $950,000. He was the third most expensive pick after Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff (both signed up for $1.55m by Bangalore Royal Challengers and Chennai Super Kings respectively). In addition Kyle Mills and Mohammad Ashraful for $150,000 and $75,000 respectively were bought by MI management. The team also signed Graham Napier and Ryan McLaren at the pre-auction signings.
In the IPL 2010 Mumbai Indians bought West Indian all-rounder Kieron Pollard for $750,000 ($2,750,000) after a silent tie-breaker with Chennai Super Kings , Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Kolkata Knight Riders .as he impressed everyone with his performances at Big Bash and Champions League .
In 2011 , as two new teams were added to the IPL, the IPL Governing Council declared that each franchise could retain a maximum of four players of their squad, only three of whom can be Indian players, and the rest of the international players would be put in the mega-auction. The Mumbai franchise, keen to have the same set of core players, retained captain Sachin Tendulkar , Vice-Captain Harbhajan Singh , All-Rounder Kieron Pollard and Fast Bowler Lasith Malinga for a total of $4.5 million. The retention left them with the power of spending only $4.5 million at the mega-auction. At the auction , they purchased Rohit Sharma as one of the costliest player in the auction along with Munaf Patel , Andrew Symonds , Aiden Blizzard, a hard-hitting Australian batsman and James Franklin , an all rounder from New Zealand.
At the 2013 IPL player auction , Mumbai Indians bought South Africans Richard Levi and Robin Peterson for $50,000 and $100,000 respectively, Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson for $300,000, Indian fast bowler R. P. Singh for $600,000 and Sri Lankan all-rounder Thisara Perera for $650,000.
After the auctions, Mumbai Indians managed to get South African explosive opener Richard Levi, who shot into limelight after hitting the fastest century in T20 international cricket and hitting a record 13 sixes, after a bidding war with Pune Warriors India. Richard Levi was brought in as a replacement for Andrew Symonds, who retired from all forms of the game citing family reasons. Sachin Tendulkar stepped down as Mumbai Indians captain ahead of the IPL 2012 season-opener against Chennai.
At the 2014 IPL player auction , Former Australian Captain Ricky Ponting was purchased by Mumbai Indians for $400,000 and he became the new captain for sixth edition of IPL. Also at the auction, Glenn Maxwell was purchased by Mumbai Indians. Also Phillip Hughes, Nathan Coulter - Nile, Jacob Oram was purchased by MI Management.
Transfers[ edit ]
In the 2008–2009 transfer window, Mumbai Indians conducted two straight swap deals, with no money exchanged. Ashish Nehra was swapped with Shikhar Dhawan of Delhi Daredevils [16] and on the last day of the transfer window, Robin Uthappa was swapped with Zaheer Khan of Royal Challengers Bangalore , [17] who plays for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy . In a three-way trade, Jaydev Shah of the Rajasthan Royals – captain of the Saurashtra Ranji squad that made it to the semi-finals and son of former cricket board secretary Niranjan Shah – will move to the Mumbai Indians.
During the transfer window, Mumbai Indians was the first team to induct a new player in their squad. Tamil Nadu wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik transferred to Mumbai Indians for $2.35 million (Rs 12.4 crores approximately). [18] Also making a switch was Rajagopal Sathish , who moved to Kings XI Punjab for an undisclosed amount. In their latest trade, Indian left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha has transferred to Mumbai Indians from Deccan Chargers for an undisclosed amount., [19] while letting Ali Murtaza move to Pune Warriors India .
On 4 November 2014, Mumbai Indians have acquired Unmukt Chand, Aaron Finch and Vinay Kumar for 2015 IPL. [20] Parthiv Patel also joins Mumbai Indians squad for 8th edition of IPL in the transfer window period. Aaron Finch along with Mitchell Mcclenaghan joins Mumbai Indians in the 2015 IPL Auction.

Background[ edit ]
Domestic Twenty20 competitions faced several setbacks in 2013. The Bangladesh Premier League included a spot-fixing scandal where seven individuals were charged. [5] Their problems with franchises missing their payments to players also continued and resulted in five franchises having their contracts conditionally terminated. [6] The Indian Premier League also included a spot-fixing case where three players were among the 39 charged. [7]
This year's Sri Lanka Premier League was cancelled after all franchises refused to pay their bank guarantees. All franchises had lost interest in participating in the tournament after they all made losses from the inaugural season. [8] As a replacement, Sri Lanka Cricket created the Super 4's Twenty20 and its four participating teams specifically for determining their representation in the CLT20. It was the first time where a team is neither a club nor a franchise and, as such, the first time where a cricketing board directly receives the proceeds from the CLT20. [9]
In Australia, the Big Bash League continued to be a success and led to more public interest in cricket, especially amongst families. [10] The Caribbean Premier League was created and had its first season in August 2013. Billed as the "ultimate cricket carnival", its major attraction was its unique party atmosphere and it was an immediate success with high attendance for all matches. Another attraction was the involvement of legends of West Indies cricket in coaching roles and Hollywood stars taking equity interests in the teams. [11] The Big Bash League introduced to the game the Zing wicket system, with LED lights on the stumps and bails that light up at almost the instant the wicket is broken, and the umpire cam, a camera attached to the caps worn by the umpires. [12] [13] Both features were also used in the Caribbean Premier League.
Format[ edit ]
The tournament features a qualifying stage and group stage. The qualifying stage consists of four teams playing a round-robin tournament from which the top two teams qualify for the group stage. These two teams join the eight teams that received direct entry in the group stage. The group stage has the teams divided into two groups of five teams and each group plays a round-robin tournament. The top two teams of each group advances to the knockout stage. The knockout stage consists of two semi-finals, with the top team of one group facing the second from the other. The winners of the semi-finals play the grand final to determine the winners of the competition. Matches ending with the scores level are decided by a Super Over , where the winners of the Super Over are declared winners of the match.
Points awarded in the qualifying and group stages:

In 2012, O'Brien signed a contract worth $80,000 with Khulna Royal Bengals represent them in the newly formed Bangladesh Premier League , a domestic t20 competition. [25] In five matches he scored 54 runs. [26]
At the end of the 2012 English County season, O'Brien left Northamptonshire after six seasons. In October 2012, it was announced that Leicestershire had signed O'Brien in a three-year deal. [27]
On 16 February 2015, he smashed unbeaten 79 runs off 60 balls with 11 fours, guided Ireland to the victory against another Test match playing nations, the West Indies . This was Ireland's third consecutive victory over test playing nations in three consecutive world cups. O'Brien's score was helped to beat mighty West Indian pace attack and finally Irish won their first match of 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup . [28]

Main article: Time in India
After independence in 1947 , the Indian government established IST as the official time for the whole country, although Kolkata and Mumbai retained their own local time (known as Calcutta time and Bombay Time ) until 1948 and 1955, respectively. [3] The Central observatory was moved from Chennai to a location at Shankargarh Fort Allahabad District , so that it would be as close to UTC +5:30 as possible.
Daylight Saving Time (DST) was used briefly during the China–Indian War of 1962 and the Indo–Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971 . [4]
Criticism and proposals[ edit ]
The country's east–west distance of more than 2,933 km (1,200  mi ) covers over 28 degrees of longitude, resulting in the sun rising and setting almost two hours earlier on India's eastern border than in the Rann of Kutch in the far west. Inhabitants of the northeastern states have to advance their clocks with the early sunrise and avoid the extra consumption of energy after daylight hours. [5]
In the late 1980s, a team of researchers proposed separating the country into two or three time zones to conserve energy. The binary system that they suggested involved a return to British–era time zones; the recommendations were not adopted. [5] [6]
In 2001, the government established a four–member committee under the Ministry of Science and Technology to examine the need for multiple time zones and daylight saving. [5] The findings of the committee, which were presented to Parliament in 2004 by the Minister for Science and Technology, Kapil Sibal , did not recommend changes to the unified system, stating that "the prime meridian was chosen with reference to a central station, and that the expanse of the Indian State was not large." [7]
Though the government has consistently refused to split the country into multiple time zones, provisions in labour laws such as the Plantations Labour Act, 1951 do allow the Central and State governments to define and set the local time for a particular industrial area. [8] In Assam , tea gardens follow a separate time zone known as the 'Tea Garden Time' or Bagantime that is one hour ahead of IST. [9]
The filmmaker Jahnu Barua has been campaigning for a separate time zone (daylight saving time) for the past 25 years. In 2010, he suggested creating a separate time zone for the Development of Northeastern Region. [10]
In 2014, Chief Minister of Assam Tarun Gogoi started campaigning for another time zone for Assam and other northeastern states of India. [11] However, the proposal would need to be cleared by the Central Government of India.
Time signals[ edit ]
Official time signals are generated by the Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory at the National Physical Laboratory in New Delhi, for both commercial and official use. The signals are based on atomic clocks and are synchronised with the worldwide system of clocks that support the Coordinated Universal Time .
Features of the Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory include:
High frequency broadcast service operating at 10 MHz under call sign ATA to synchronise the user clock within a millisecond;
Indian National Satellite System satellite–based standard time and frequency broadcast service, which offers IST correct to ±10 microsecond and frequency calibration of up to ±10−10; and
Time and frequency calibrations made with the help of pico– and nanoseconds time interval frequency counters and phase recorders.
IST is taken as the standard time as it passes through almost the centre of India. To communicate the exact time to the people, the exact time is broadcast over the state–owned All India Radio and Doordarshan television network. Telephone companies have dedicated phone numbers connected to mirror timeservers that also relay the precise time. Another increasingly popular means of obtaining the time is through Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. [12]



Chennai v Bangalore, IPL 2011, Final, Chennai May 28, 2011
Vijay stars in Chennai's successful title defence

Chennai Super Kings 205 for 5 (Vijay 95, Hussey 63) beat Royal Challengers Bangalore 147 for 8 (Ashwin 3-16) by 58 runs

What would have been on Chennai Super Kings' wish list before this final? 1) Win toss on a slow pitch. 2) Great start by the openers. 3) Remove Chris Gayle for a duck. PS: While we are it why not knock out AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli cheaply? They got all that. Chennai produced a near-perfect game and mauled Royal Challengers Bangalore to lift their second IPL trophy.
M Vijay has rarely converted his starts this IPL and Michael Hussey hasn't sparkled in the previous few games. So what they do on the day of the big finale? They amass a sizzling 159-run partnership to launch Chennai to a massive total at the Chidambaram Stadium. R Ashwin then derailed the chase by packing off Gayle for a duck in the first over. Game over.
It was the ease with which the runs flowed and the calm manner in which they were accumulated by the Chennai openers that caught the eye. There were several big shots but nearly all of them were in conventional zones. There was just one bad shot in the first 14 overs. Just one. In the 10th over, Vijay had just played a nonchalant flick that sailed just clear of a lunging Luke Pomersbach on the deep-midwicket boundary. He then tried to slog the next ball across the line and edged it to the leg side. The reaction of the players reflected their awareness of the need to keep adrenalin in check: Vijay shadow practiced a straighter arc of the bat and Hussey rushed across to have a long chat.
For the duration of the partnership, which lasted 14.5 overs, they complemented each other with contrasting approaches. Hussey punctuated his bunts, chips and drives with the occasional big hit - the highlight was a monstrous heave off Syed Mohammad that crashed into the roof beyond wide long-on. Vijay went the other way. He punctuated his flamboyant on-the-up hits with quieter punches for singles and twos. They both ran between the wickets hard and fast and the scoring-rate never flagged. Vijay grew increasingly tired but it was Hussey who fell first, swatting a full toss from Mohammad to long-on. By then, they had laid a great platform.
It was Vijay who started the mayhem off the final delivery of the second over with a special shot. It was a short-of-length delivery with little room for maneuvering, or so it seemed, but Vijay wafted it on the up and through the line for a flamboyant six over long-on. Hussey pulled the next delivery, from Zaheer Khan, over the backward square-leg boundary to launch the assault. They repeated that double-dose of sixes again. Hussey swung the final delivery of the fifth over, bowled by Mohammad, over the midwicket boundary and Vijay lifted the next ball, from Chris Gayle, over long-on. Chennai reached 56 for 0 in six overs and kept going from strength to strength.
They started their bowling in the same way. Ashwin just needed three deliveries to remove the chief thorn in their path. The first two turned sharply away from Gayle before the third hile the usual club captain, Daryl Mitchell , was injured. Though he had captained England Under-19s, it was the first time he filled the role for his county. As he was inexperienced, Moeen approached senior players Vikram Solanki and Ben Scott for advice. [12]
Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal was Worcestershire's overseas player for a short time in 2011 and while at the club he encouraged Moeen to try bowling the doosra . [13] Moeen had to wait until July before registering his first century of the season, and his first since September the previous year. [14] His innings of 158 runs from 244 balls against Somerset was in vain as Worcestershire succumbed to an innings defeat. [15] The following month Moeen twice scored a century in the Clydesdale Bank 40 only for Worcestershire to lose, against Sussex and the Netherlands . [16] [17] In the first match against Sussex he passed his previous best score of 136 in List A cricket, scoring 158 runs from 92 balls. [16] In Worcestershire's first season back in the first division, Moeen scored 930 runs in the County Championship, making him the club's second-highest run scorer in the competition behind Solanki. Moeen average 33.21 runs per innings and scored a single century. [18] On the back of his performances for Worcestershire, Moeen was included in the 13-man England Development squad which trained in late 2011. [19]
2012 Season[ edit ]
In February 2012, before the start of the English season, Worcestershire's director of cricket Steve Rhodes commented that Ali's doosra was "not too difficult to pick at the moment but he's learning a few tricks and he's got other things up his sleeve. It's a work in progress". [13]
2013 Season[ edit ]
After the departure of former England international Vikram Solanki at the end of the 2012 season Ali was handed a new 5-year contract. [20] After performing well, including five consecutive 50s, Ali was called up to the England Lions where he scored 61 runs against Australia [21] with many calling for him to be selected for the full side.
Moeen averaged 62 in Division 2, totalling 1375 runs altogether - the highest of any batsmen in first class cricket and finished with 4 centuries and 8 fiftys as well as 28 wickets. He was awarded county cricket's MVP award [22] beating Samit Patel on the final day of the season and was also named PCA player of the year. [23] Ali was also called up to the England development squad ahead of their Australian Ashes tour.

2014 West Indies[ edit ]
Ali was included in the English Squad for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh . [24] Before the tournament, the squad played the West Indies in a limited overs series, and Ali made his ODI debut against the West Indies on 28 February 2014. [25] He scored 44 runs before being dismissed and took his maiden ODI wicket. [26] In the second match he made ten runs and took figures of 1-11. Ali was again impressive in the third match, making his first half century in a score of 55. He ended up scoring 109 runs and picking up 3 wickets in the three match series. He made his T20 debut in the second match of the T20 series, [25] although he scored just 3 runs and did not bowl. [27] In the final match of the series he batted at 7 but was run out for 3 runs.
2014 World T20[ edit ]
Ali was a part of England's world T20 squad. He managed 49 runs in 4 matches and ending up wicketless. [28] His tournament got off to a good start with him hitting 36 against New Zealand, and bowling 1 over for 7 runs. In the second game against Sri Lanka, he was dismissed for a first ball duck, although only four runs came of his over. Against South Africa he managed 10 runs and bowled two overs for 17 runs. He had a poor final match against the Netherlands, bowling 1 over 13 runs and being dismissed for just 3.
2014 Sri Lanka and India[ edit ]
Moeen Ali bowling against Sri Lanka in 2014
Ali was named in the England Test squad for their series against Sri Lanka , [29] before making his debut in the first Test. [30] Ali made a score of 48 in the initial innings but only made 4 in the second. However, in the second Test of the series he made his maiden century in the second innings having started the final day with England on 57 for 5. England lost the match when Jimmy Anderson was caught off the penultimate ball of the match having survived 55 balls.
In the first Test against India, Ali took four wickets in the match, as well as scoring 14 with the bat. In the second match he made scores of 32 and 39, but could not prevent England from losing to go 1-0 down in the series. In the third test against India at the Ageas Bowl, he took his first 5 wicket haul in test cricket, finishing with 6-67 in India's second innings. He followed this up by taking figures of 4-39 in the fourth test, taking the prized wicket of MS Dhoni. This helped England win the game and take a 2-1 series lead. Ali only played a small part in the final match of the series, making 14 with the bat as England steamrolled India to win the series 3-1. Ali did not play in the first three ODIs against India. However, he was selected for the fourth match of the series and hit a quick fire 67. However, this was not enough to prevent a nine wicket defeat for England. In the final match of the series Ali took 2-34 to help England win their first match of the series. He was out for a duck in the only T20 match between the two sides, although he did take a wicket as England went on to win the game.
In the first ODI of the seven-match series in Sri Lanka, Ali hit 119 of just 87 balls although it was not enough to prevent a defeat for England. In the second game he could only score two, although he did finish with figures of 1-38. In the hire match he scored 58 and took figures of 2-36 as England won their first match of the tour. He was less impressive in the next two games, making just 23 runs and taking one wicket in the two matches combined. He hit 34 in the penultimate match of the series, although he again failed to take a wicket. In the final match he took figures of 2-39 but was later out for a duck as England lost he match and the series 5-2.
2015 Tri Series[ edit ]
Ahead of the Tri series against Australia and India it was announced that Ali would keep his spot at the top of the order for England. He scored 22 in the first match of the series against Australia as England lost the first game of the tournament. In the following match against India Ali scored eight with the bat and took 1-31 with the ball. He made 46 in the next game against Australia and also took two wickets, but England lost the match. In the must win game against India, Ali took 2-35 to help England reach the final. However, despite Ali taking a wicket in the final they lost the match to Australia.
2015 World Cup[ edit ]
In the first match of England's World Cup campaign against Australia, Ali made 10 with the bat and failed to take a wicket as England suffered a heavy defeat. He made 20 in the next match against New Zealand as England suffered a humiliating eight wicket defeat. He scored a century in the next match against Scotland, making 128 from 107 balls to help England to a score of 303. He also took two wickets in Scotland's innings as he earned the man of the match award. He was less effective against Sri Lanka, making just 15 and taking figures of 1-50 as England lost the game. This meant they had to beat Bangladesh to qualify for the Quarter finals, but they suffered defeat, with Ali making just 15 as England failed to chase down 275. Injury ruled Ali out of the final game against Afghanistan, which England won.
2015 West Indies and New Zealand[ edit ]
Due to his injury at the World Cup, Ali was not initially selected for the West Indies tour . [31] However, after recovering, he was called up for the Second Test Match of the series. [32] In the first innings, Ali took figures of 1-47, and was run out for a duck. In the West Indies' second innings his bowling figures were 3/51, and he was not required to bat in England's second innings as they went on to secure a nine wicket victory to lead the series 1-0. [33] In the second Test Moeen made 58rgest political controversies in recent years. Three BBC News reports ( Andrew Gilligan 's on Today , Gavin Hewitt's on The Ten O'Clock News and another on Newsnight ) quoted an anonymous source that stated the British government (particularly the Prime Minister's office) had embellished the September Dossier with misleading exaggerations of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities. The government denounced the reports and accused the corporation of poor journalism.
In subsequent weeks the corporation stood by the report, saying that it had a reliable source. Following intense media speculation, David Kelly was named in the press as the source for Gilligan's story on 9 July 2003. Kelly was found dead, by suicide, in a field close to his home early on 18 July. An inquiry led by Lord Hutton was announced by the British government the following day to investigate the circumstances leading to Kelly's death, concluding that "Dr. Kelly took his own life." [81]
In his report on 28 January 2004, Lord Hutton concluded that Gilligan's original accusation was "unfounded" and the BBC's editorial and management processes were "defective". In particular, it specifically criticised the chain of management that caused the BBC to defend its story. The BBC Director of News, Richard Sambrook , the report said, had accepted Gilligan's word that his story was accurate in spite of his notes being incomplete. Davies had then told the BBC Board of Governors that he was happy with the story and told the Prime Minister that a satisfactory internal inquiry had taken place. The Board of Governors, under the chairman's, Gavyn Davies , guidance, accepted that further investigation of the Government's complaints were unnecessary.
Because of the criticism in the Hutton report, Davies resigned on the day of publication. BBC News faced an important test, reporting on itself with the publication of the report, but by common consent (of the Board of Governors) managed this "independently, impartially and honestly". [82] Davies' resignation was followed by the resignation of Director General , Greg Dyke , the following day, and the resignation of Gilligan on 30 January. While undoubtedly a traumatic experience for the corporation, an ICM poll in April 2003 indicated that it had sustained its position as the best and most trusted provider of news. [83]
See also: Criticism of the BBC § Middle East and Israel and Balen Report
The BBC has faced accusations of holding both anti- Israel and anti- Palestine bias.
Douglas Davis, the London correspondent of The Jerusalem Post , has described the BBC's coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict as "a relentless, one-dimensional portrayal of Israel as a demonic, criminal state and Israelis as brutal oppressors [which] bears all the hallmarks of a concerted campaign of vilification that, wittingly or not, has the effect of delegitimising the Jewish state and pumping oxygen into a dark old European hatred that dared not speak its name for the past half-century.". [84] However two large independent studies, one conducted by Loughborough University and the other by Glasgow University's Media Group concluded that Israeli perspectives are given greater coverage. [85] [86]
Critics of the BBC argue that the Balen Report proves systematic bias against Israel in headline news programming. Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph criticised the BBC for spending hundreds of thousands of British tax payers' pounds from preventing the report being released to the public. [87] [88] [89]
Jeremy Bowen , the Middle East Editor for BBC world news, was singled out specifically for bias by the BBC Trust which concluded that he violated "BBC guidelines on accuracy and impartiality." [90]
An independent panel appointed by the BBC Trust was set up in 2006 to review the impartiality of the BBC's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . [91] The panel's assessment was that "apart from individual lapses, there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias." While noting a "commitment to be fair accurate and impartial" and praising much of the BBC's coverage the independent panel concluded "that BBC output does not consistently give a full and fair account of the conflict. In some ways the picture is incomplete and, in that sense, misleading." It notes that, "the failure to convey adequately the disparity in the Israeli and Palestinian experience, [reflects] the fact that one side is in control and the other lives under occupation".
Writing in the FT, Philip Stephens , one of the panellists, later accused the BBC's director-general, Mark Thompson, of misrepresenting the panel's conclusions. He further opined "My sense is that BBC news reporting has also lost a once iron-clad commitment to objectivity and a necessary respect for the democratic process. If I am right, the BBC, too, is lost". [92] Mark Thompson published a rebuttal in the FT the next day. [93]
The description by one BBC correspondent reporting on the funeral of Yassir Arafat that she had been left with tears in her eyes led to other questions of impartiality, particularly from Martin Walker [94] in a guest opinion piece in The Times , who picked out the apparent case of Fayad Abu Shamala, the BBC Arabic Service correspondent, who told a Hamas rally on 6 May 2001, that journalists in Gaza were "waging the campaign shoulder to shoulder together with the Palestinian people." [94]
Walker argues that the independent inquiry was flawed for two reasons. Firstly, because the time period over which it was conducted (August 2005 to January 2006) surrounded the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Ariel Sharon 's stroke, which produced more positive coverage than usual. Furthermore, he wrote, the inquiry only looked at the BBC's domestic coverage, and excluded output on the BBC World Service and BBC World. [94]
Tom Gross accused the BBC of glorifying Hamas suicide bombers , and condemned its policy of inviting guests such as Jenny Tonge and Tom Paulin who have compared Israeli soldiers to Nazis . Writing for the BBC, Paulin said Israeli soldiers should be "shot dead" like Hitler 's S.S, and said he could "understand how suicide bombers feel."[ citation needed ] According to Gross, Paulin and Tonge continue to be invited as regular guests, and they are among the most frequent contributors to their most widely-screened arts programme. [95]
The BBC also faced criticism for not airing a Disasters Emergency Committee aid appeal for Palestinians who suffered in Gaza during 22-day war there in late 2008/early 2009. Most other major UK broadcasters did air this appeal, but rival Sky News did not.[ citation needed ]
British journalist Julie Burchill has accused BBC of creating a "climate of fear" for British Jews over its "excessive coverage" of Israel compared to other nations. [96]
Partners[ edit ]
BBC and ABC also share video segments and reporters as needed in producing their newscasts. with the BBC showing ABC World News Tonight with David Muir in the UK.
The view of foreign governments[ edit ]
BBC News reporters and broadcasts are now and have in the past been banned in several countries primarily for reporting which has been unfavourable to the ruling government. For example, correspondents were banned by the former apartheid régime of South Africa. The BBC was banned in Zimbabwe under Mugabe [97] for eight years as a terrorist organisation until being allowed to operate again over a year after the 2008 elections . [98] The BBC was banned in Burma (officially Myanmar) after BBC's coverage and commentary on anti-government protests there in September 2007. The ban was lifted 4 years later on September 2011. Other cases have included Uzbekistan , [99] China, [100] and Pakistan . [101] The BBC online news site's Persian version was blocked from the Iranian internet in 2006. [102] The BBC News website was made available in China again in March 2008 [103] but as of October 2014 was blocked again. [104] In June 2015 the Rwandan government placed an indefinite ban on BBC broadcasts following the airing of a controversial documentary regarding the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Rwanda’s Untold Story, broadcast on BBC246 overs long.
Decreased target
On 3 December 2014, Sri Lanka played England and batted first, but play was interrupted when Sri Lanka had scored 6/1 from 2 overs. At the restart both innings were reduced to 35 overs, and Sri Lanka finished on 242/8. England's target was set by D/L at 236 from 35 overs. [5] Although Sri Lanka had less resource remaining to them after the interruption than England would have for their whole innings (about 7% less), they'd used up so much resource before the interruption (2 overs and 1 wicket, about 8%), that the total resource used by Sri Lanka was still slightly more than England would have available, hence the slightly decreased target for England.
Stoppage in second innings[ edit ]
A simple example of the D/L method being applied was the first ODI between India and Pakistan in their 2006 ODI series. [6] India batted first, and were all out for 328. Pakistan, batting second, were 311/7 when bad light stopped play after the 47th over. Pakistan's target, had the match continued, was 18 runs in 18 balls, with three wickets in hand. Considering the overall scoring rate throughout the match, this is a target most teams would be favoured to achieve. And indeed, application of the D/L method resulted in a retrospective target score of 305 (or par score of 304) at the end of the 47th over, with the result therefore officially listed as "Pakistan won by 7 runs (D/L Method)".
The D/L method was used in the group stage match between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe at the 20/20 World Cup in 2010 . Sri Lanka scored 173/7 in 20 overs batting first, and in reply Zimbabwe were 4/0 from 1 over when rain interrupted play. At the restart Zimbabwe's target was reduced to 108 from 12 overs, but rain stopped the match when they had scored 29/1 from 5 overs. The retrospective D/L target from 5 overs was a further reduction to 44, or a par score of 43, and hence Sri Lanka won the match by 14 runs. [7] [8]
Stoppages in both innings[ edit ]
During the 2012/13 KFC Big Bash League , D/L was used in the 2nd semi-final played between the Melbourne Stars and the Perth Scorchers . After rain delayed the start of the match, it interrupted Melbourne's innings when they had scored 159/1 off 15.2 overs, and both innings were reduced by 2 overs to 18, and Melbourne finished on 183/2. After a further rain delay reduced Perth's innings to 17 overs, Perth returned to the field to face 13 overs, with a revised target of 139. Perth won the game by 8 wickets with a boundary off the final ball. [9] [10]
Theory[ edit ]
The essence of the D/L method is 'resources'. Each team is taken to have two 'resources' to use to make as many runs as possible: the number of overs they have to receive; and the number of wickets they have in hand. At any point in any innings , a team's ability to score more runs depends on the combination of these two resources. Looking at historical scores, there is a very close correspondence between the availability of these resources and a team's final score, a correspondence which D/L exploits. [11]
Using a published table or computer which gives the percentage of these combined resources remaining for any number of overs (or, more accurately, balls) left and wickets lost, the target score can be adjusted up or down to reflect the loss of resources to one or both teams when a match is shortened one or more times. The two teams' resource percentages are found, and used to calculate a 'par score' for the second team that is usually a fractional number of runs. The target score is this number rounded up to the next integer , and the score to tie (also called the par score), is this number rounded down to the preceding integer. If the second team reaches or passes the target score, then they have won the match. If the match ends when the second team has exactly met (but not passed) the par score then the match is a tie. If the second team fail to reach the par score then they have lost.
An example of such a tie was found in the one day international between England and India on 11 September 2011. This match was frequently interrupted by rain in the final overs, and a ball-by-ball calculation of the Duckworth–Lewis 'par' score played a key role in the tactical decisions made during those overs. At one point, India were ahead according to this calculation, during one rain delay (and would have won if play was unable to be resumed). At a second rain interval, England, who had scored some quick runs (precisely because they were aware of the need to get ahead in D/L terms) would correspondingly have won if play had not resumed. Play was finally called off with just 7 balls of the match remaining and England's score equal to the Duckworth–Lewis 'par' score, therefore resulting in a tied match.
This example does show how crucial (and difficult) the decisions of the umpires can be, in assessing at exactly what point the rain is heavy enough to justify ceasing play. If the umpires of that match had halted play one ball earlier, England would have been ahead on D/L, and so would have won the match. Equally, if play had stopped one ball later, without England scoring off that ball, India would have won the match – indicating how finely-tuned D/L calculations can be in such situations.
Application[ edit ]
As with most non-trivial statistical derivations, the D/L method can produce results that are somewhat counter intuitive , and the announcement of the derived target score can provoke a good deal of second-guessing and discussion amongst the crowd at the cricket ground. This can also be seen as one of the method's successes, adding interest to a "slow" rain-affected day of play.
For 50-over matches, each team must face at least 20 overs before D/L can decide the game, unless one or both sides have been bowled out in less than 20 overs and/or the team batting second has reached its target in less than 20 overs. For Twenty20 games, each side must face at least five overs before D/L can decide the game, unless one or both sides have been bowled out in less than five overs and/or the team batting second has reached its target in less than five overs. If these prerequisites are not met, the match is declared a no result .
Standard Edition and Professional Edition[ edit ]
Until 2003, a single version of the D/L method was in use. This used a single published reference table of total resource percentages remaining for all possible combinations of overs and wickets, [12] and some simple mathematical calculations, and was relatively transparent and straightforward to implement. However, it had a known flaw in how it handled very high first innings scores (350+). Following the 2003 World Cup, a second version was introduced which overcomes this flaw by using substantially more sophisticated statistical modelling. However, this version does not use a single table of resource percentages, instead the percentages also vary with score, so the percentages must be obtained from a computer. Therefore, it loses some of the previous advantages of transparency and simplicity. The original version was named the Standard Edition, and the new version was named the Professional Edition.
Tony Lewis said, 'We were then [at the time of the 2003 Cricket World Cup Final ] using what is now known as the Standard Edition. We knew that under normal circumstances it worked well, but we had also known for a while that in case of very big totals the approach was not really that good. We did have in place a computerised version, but it meant that the transparency was lost. You couldn’t do it manually by looking up the tables. Up until that point the ICC were very happy with the manual version and the transparency that came with it. But Australia got 359 and that showed up the flaws and straightaway the next edition was introduced which handled high scores much better. The par score for India is likely to be much higher now.' [13]
Duckworth and Lewis wrote, 'When the side batting first score at or below the average for top level cricket..., the results of applying the Professional Edition are generally similar to those from the Standard Edition. For higher scoring matches, the results start to diverge and the difference increases the higher the first innings total. In effect there is now a different table of resource percentages for every total score in the Team 1 innings.' [14]
The decision on which edition should be used is for the cricket authority which runs the particular competition. [15] The ICC Playing Handbook, [16] the official handbook for international matches, says 'The Professional Edition of the Duckworth–Lewis method shall be used in all [international] matches... Where possible, arrangements shall be made for the provision of back-up capability, in case of computer malfunction, for the operation or continued operation of the Professional Edition. In the event of computer non-availability or malfunction where no such provision has been made, the Standard Edition (the method in use prior to October 2003) shall be used.' [17] This also applies to most countries’ national competitions. [15] At lower levels of the game, where use of a computer cannot always be guaranteed, the Standard Edition is used. [18]
Calculations[ edit ]
Using the notation of the ICC Playing Handbook, [16] the team that bats first is called Team 1, their final score is called S, the total resources available to Team 1 for their innings is called R1, the team that bats second is called Team 2, and the total resources available to Team 2 for their innings is called R2.

2009 IPL season[ edit ]
The Daredevils dominated for much of the 2009 IPL under the captaincy of Gautam Gambhir , finishing at the top of the table after the league stages despite a mid-tournament injury to icon player Virender Sehwag . AB de Villiers and Tillakaratne Dilshan both had developed greatly since the last season and set up many large totals for the Daredevils, with de Villiers hitting one of only two centuries in the 2009 IPL, which was held in South Africa. The bowling, which in 2008 was composed mainly of overseas players (Maharoof, Vettori, McGrath, Asif) was bolstered by a trade to gain former Team India paceman Ashish Nehra in exchange for Shikhar Dhawan . Pradeep Sangwan and Amit Mishra had both improved since last season, and the offseason signing of Dirk Nannes from Australia created a bowling lineup that was strong. In fact, the Daredevils left the likes of Vettori, Collingwood and McGrath on the bench for most of the tournament, preferring to go with the oversas combination of Nannes, de Villiers, Dilshan and David Warner .
However, despite dominating for the regular season, the Daredevils crumbled in the semi-final under a fierce batting assault by Adam Gilchrist , who hit the 3rd fastest fifty in IPL history (just 17 balls). Nannes in particular, who was again picked over McGrath, was punished by Gilchrist and later by Andrew Symonds . The disappointing semi-final meant Delhi did not contest the final of the 2009 IPL despite having the best record in the league stages. However, Delhi managed to qualify for 2009 Champions League Twenty20 because of their performance in group stage.
Delhi was the table topper or the league topper in 2012. Morne Morkel of Delhi was the highest wicket taker of the tournament. Delhi came third in the tournament and qualified for the second time in champions league.
Iconic Australian pace bowler Glenn McGrath expressed disappointment over not being picked to play any match during the whole season, and has since then stopped playing for Delhi. [1] [2]
2012 IPL season[ edit ]
Main article: Delhi Daredevils in 2012
Due to the disbanding of Kochi Tuskers Kerala , each team will play the remaining eight teams twice, once at home and once away. Therefore each team will play an extended season of 16 matches.
In the IPL season of 2012 a new Delhi Daredevils side was seen after a poor 2011 season where they finished last they came back strongly they bought some star-studded players like Kevin Pietersen, Mahela Jayawardene and Ross Taylor.They stood first in the Pool Table with Kolkata Knight Riders second Mumbai Indians third and Chennai Super Kings fourth also qualifying for the Champion League Twenty20 2012 in South Africa.
Mahela Jayawardane was appointed as the new captain of the Delhi Daredevils as Virender Sehwag stepped down from captaincy during 2012 Champions League Twenty20.
2013 IPL season[ edit ]
Main article: Delhi Daredevils in 2013
The Delhi Daredevils lost all first six matches of IPL 2013 and they won their first match in 7 games against the Mumbai Indians . Virender Sehwag and Mahela Jayawardene 's partnership led to an inevitable win against Mumbai Indians in which they scored 161. Sehwag was the Man of the Match for his brilliant score of 95* of 57 balls. After this match, they faced the kings X1 Punjab and lost again. But in their 9th match of the season, against Pune Warriors India , they won and advanced to 8th place in the points table. They defeated Kolkata Knight Riders in their 10th Match by 7 wickets but failed to advance to 7th place due to their net run-rate. In their next match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad , Delhi Daredevils were bowled out for just 80, which was the lowest total in their IPL history, giving the Sunrisers an easy win. Then, in their match against Rajasthan Royals , they scored 154 thanks to new recruit Ben Rohrer 's brilliant half-century, but that was in vain as Rajasthan chased the total down easily with only 1 wicket falling and this also officially eliminated Delhi Daredevils from the 2014 IPL Qualifiers. In their next match, against Royal Challengers Bangalore , they bowled well and the Royal Challengers were 106 in 16.0 overs but scored 77 in their last four overs and got to 183 thanks to a well-made 99 by Virat Kohli . Daredevils lost a close match match by 4 runs. Daredevils next played Chennai Super Kings , who batted first and posted 168. Delhi Daredevils never got into the game and lost by 33 runs. Daredevils' next match was against Kings XI Punjab and they again lost, this time by 7 runs, as they failed to chase 172. Their final game was against Pune Warriors India which was to decide which team would come last. Delhi bowled first and Pune Warriors posted a total of 171. Delhi Daredevils were going fine until they started losing wickets rapidly. They couldn't chase the target and lost by 38 runs finishing in last place out of the 9 teams this season. Delhi only won 3 matches out of 16 played and didn't won any away games in the season. Despite coming last in the table a few big names were added to the support staff as the season went on like the legendary Sir Vivian Richards being named their new brand ambassador, former England spinner Jeremy Snape added to the support staff and renowned former Pakistan spinner Mushtaq Ahmed named as their new spin bowling coach.
2014 IPL season[ edit ]
Ahead of players auction for IPL 2014, on 10 January 2014 Delhi Daredevils team announced that they will not retain any players for their current squad for the season 7 of IPL. With no players retained, the team will have the maximum right-to-match cards among all the franchises at the auction: i.e., three. They will also have their full purse of Rs 600 million (approx US$9.6) to spend at the players auction. Virender Sehwag now represents King's XI Punjab franchise. The Delhi Daredevils had a poor season. They lost their first match, against Royal Challengers Bangalore, however they won their next match against Kolkata Knight Riders. This was followed by a heavy loss against the Chennai Super Kings and a close match which resulted in a loss against the Sunrisers Hyderabad. Delhi Daredevils, won their next match against Mumbai Indians. Later, when IPL shifted from the United Arab Emirates to India, they lost their next nine matches. The Delhi Daredevils won only two out of their 14 matches, that too all in the United Arab Emirates. Despite their poor performance, JP Duminy, had a relatively good season overall scoring 410 runs from 14 matches at an average of 51.25 and was the tournament's eighth highest run-scorer. The Delhi Daredevils team, once again finiubts that it is totally accurate, then consider making a reasonable effort to find a reference yourself. In the process you may end up confirming that the statement is too doubtful to remain.
If you feel an article, or a section within an article, needs more than one or two tags then ALWAYS add a {{ Unreferenced }} or {{ Unreferenced section }} tag to the article or section concerned instead of an ugly battery of individual tags..
Unless you have very good reason to suppose otherwise - it is fair to assume that a reference at the end of a paragraph refers to the whole paragraph, and a reference at the end of a sentence refers to the whole sentence.
NEVER insert a "Citation needed" tag (or, worse, a whole battery of them) to make an extraneous point, to "pay back" another editor for inappropriate behaviour of any kind, or because you generally "don't like" a subject, a particular article, or another editor. Gross examples of this sort of thing are, frankly, vandalism, but otherwise thoughtful and well-behaved editors may at times be guilty of this one unconsciously.
If your work has been tagged
If you can provide a reliable source for the claim, please be bold and replace the "Citation needed" template with enough information to locate the source. You may leave the copyediting to someone else, or learn more about citing sources on Wikipedia . Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners provides a brief introduction on how to reference Wikipedia articles.
If someone tagged your contributions with a "Citation needed" tag and you disagree, discuss the matter on the article's discussion page . The most constructive thing to do in most cases is probably to supply the reference requested, even if you feel the tag was not justified.

History[ edit ]
The Ashoka pillar at Firoz Shah Kotla
Feroz Shah Tughlaq (r. 1351–88), the Sultan of Delhi , established the fortified city of Firuzabad [3] in 1354, as the new capital of the Delhi Sultanate , and included in it the site of the present Feroz Shah Kotla. Kotla literally means fortress or citadel. The pillar, also called obelisk or Lat is an Ashoka Column , attributed to Mauryan ruler Ashoka. The 13.1 metres high column, made of polished sandstone and dating from the 3rd Century BC, was brought from Ambala in 14th century AD under orders of Feroz Shah. It was installed on a three-tiered arcaded pavilion near the congregational mosque, inside the Sultanate's fort. In centuries that followed, much of the structure and buildings near it were destroyed as subsequent rulers dismantled them and reused the spolia as building materials. [4] [5]
In the pre-independence era, due to lack of auditoriums in the capital, most classical music performances were staged here or at Qutub complex . Later Ebrahim Alkazi , then head of NSD, staged his landmark production of Dharamvir Bharati 's Andha Yug here and its premiere in 1964 was attended by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru . [6]
Script on stone[ edit ]
The inscription on Ashoka pillar at Firoz Shah Kotla.
A close up of the inscription on the lat (obelisk).
The Sultanate had wanted to break and reuse the Ashoka pillar for a minaret. Firoz Shah Tuhglaq decided to erect it near a mosque instead. At the time of re-installation of the obelisk in Delhi, in 1356, no one knew the meaning of the script engraved in the stone. [7]
About five hundred years later, the script was deciphered by James Prinsep in 1837 with help from scripts discovered on other pillars and tablets in South Asia. [1]
Translation[ edit ]
The inscription on the 3rd century pillar describe King Devanampiya Piyadasi's [8] policies and appeal to the people and future generations of the kingdom in matters of dharma (just, virtuous life), moral precepts and freedoms. Some extracts of the translation, per James Prinsep , are as follows: [1]
Among high roads, I have caused fig trees to be planted that they may be for shade to animals and men...
— -Inscription on Ashoka Pillar [1]
...And let these and others the most skillful in the sacred offices discreetly and respectfully use their most persuasive efforts, acting on the heart and eyes of the children, for the purposes of imparting enthusiasm and instruction in dharma (religion).
— -Inscription on Ashoka Pillar [1]
And whatsoever benevolent acts have been done by me, the same shall be prescribed as duties to the people who follow after me, and in this manner shall their influence and increase be manifest - by service to father and mother, by service to spiritual pastors, by respectful demeanor to the aged and full of years, by kindness to learned, to the orphan and destitute and servants and minstrel tribe.
— -Inscription on Ashoka Pillar [1]
And religion increaseth among men by two separate processes - by performance of religious offices, and by security against persecution. (...) And that religion may be free from the persecution of men, that it may increase through the absolute prohibition to put to death (any) living beings or sacrifice aught that draweth breath. For such an object is all this done, that it may endure to my sons and sons' sons - as long the sun and the moon shall last.
— -Inscription on Ashoka Pillar [1]
Let stone pillars be prepared and let this edict of dharma (religion) be engraven thereon, that it may endure unto the remotest ages.
— -Inscription on Ashoka Pillar, Translated by James Prinsep in 1837 [1]

10.2 Gayle to Hodge, and whoa what a crazy run-out pulled off by ABD. Take a bow AB de Villiers! He didn't need to do this, but he has done it. What drama between Hodge and Patel too. Back from start. Hodge cuts it to short third and charges off right away. Patel, whose call it should be, says no after a bit, and both start going to the non-striker's end. de Villiers meanwhile doesn't know that this is an easy chance, and gets this wild throw, collects it diving to his left, and in the same motion flicks it onto the stumps even as he is going down. To make it more dramatic, there is a photo finish as to who is closer to the non-striker's out and should stay back. Replays show Patel has lost by inches 73/4

Peter Jeffrey ("Jeff") Leroy Dujon (born 28 May 1956) is a retired West Indian cricketer and current commentator.
He was the wicketkeeper for the West Indian cricket team of the 1980s, an athletic presence behind the stumps as well as a competent lower-order batsman.
Dujon made his first-class debut in 1974, going on to play 200 first-class matches for Jamaica and the West Indies in a career that lasted nineteen years. He scored nearly 10,000 runs at an average approaching 40 runs per innings, an impressive statistic when compared to other specialist wicket-keepers over time, as well as completing 447 catches and 22 stumpings.
Dujon was one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1989 and since retiring as a player in 1992, has worked as assistant coach to the West Indies national team and in development of young cricket players in his native Jamaica.

Early years[ edit ]
Marsh played backyard cricket with his older brother Graham , who became a professional golfer and won eleven times on the European Tour. Both brothers represented WA at cricket at schoolboy level. Marsh played his first competitive match at the age of eight for the Armadale under-16s. He kept wicket from the start, but batting was his strength. At thirteen he captained the state schoolboys' team, and joined the West Perth district club.
When he debuted for West Perth's first XI he was a specialist batsman, as WA wicketkeeper Gordon Becker also represented the club. In order to further his keeping, Marsh joined the University club . Marsh made his first-class debut for WA, again as a specialist batsman, against the touring West Indies in 1968–69. He had an unusual match, scoring 0 and 104. [1]
Test career[ edit ]
Marsh replaced the retired Becker for the 1969–70 season. At the time, Australia was touring India and South Africa with Brian Taber and Ray Jordon as the team's wicketkeepers. In the autumn of 1970, an Australian second team toured New Zealand with John MacLean as wicketkeeper. Therefore, Marsh was behind these players in the pecking order. However, he was a controversial selection for the first Test of the 1970–71 Ashes series, replacing Taber. His superior batting had won him the position.
The media was quick to criticise Marsh’s glovework in his early career, dubbing him “Iron Gloves” after he missed a number of catches. Even on his debut in the First Test in the 1970–71 Ashes series he took four catches in his first innings. His batting proved invaluable on a number of occasions and in the Fifth Test, he equalled the record for the highest Test innings by an Australian keeper, set by Don Tallon . The end of the innings was controversial; the captain Bill Lawry declared with Marsh eight runs short of a century [4] so he could get an extra hour of bowling before stumps. When questioned by the press about his lost chance to make an historic century Marsh said he had gained forty runs instead of missing eight as he thought Lawry should have declared an hour earlier. [5] Marsh later admitted that he was underprepared as a wicketkeeper, but he learned from watching his English counterpart Alan Knott . [1] He and Knott did, however, concede the same number of byes in the series: 44.
Marsh became an integral part of the team as the side improved during the 1972 tour of England. He became the first Australian keeper to hit a century by scoring 118 in the first Test against Pakistan at Adelaide in 1972–73. He also hit 236 against the tourists for WA, the best score of his career. Playing a key role in Australia's series victories over England and the West Indies in the series of 1974–75 and 1975–76, Marsh made many acrobatic dives to catch balls delivered by Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson . He took 45 dismissals in those two series, including a world-record 26 catches in six Tests against the West Indies. [1]
Marsh scored an unbeaten 110 in the second innings of the Centenary Test against England in 1977, becoming the first Australian wicketkeeper to score a Test century against England. In the same match he passed Wally Grout 's Australian wicket-keeping record of 187 Test dismissals. [1] He scored a further 16 half centuries. In first class matches, he accumulated 11 centuries including a best of 236, aggregating more than 10000 runs in his career. [4]
When the breakaway World Series Cricket was formed, Marsh had no hesitation in signing for Kerry Packer . He claimed 54 dismissals in 16 Supertests. Upon his return to traditional international cricket in 1979–80, his age did not affect his keeping ability. On the 1981 tour of England, he took 23 dismissals to become the first wicketkeeper to take 100 dismissals in Ashes Tests, broke Knott’s world record in 22 fewer Tests and passed 3000 runs in Test cricket. [1] In 1982–83, his second last season, he took 28 dismissals against England, including nine and eight in the Second and Third Test respectively. [4] His batting form fell away towards the end of his Test career, his last 22 Tests yielding only 589 runs at an average of 19.63.

History[ edit ]
Pathankot is an ancient city and has historical significance. It was ruled by many rulers. Till 1781, Pathankot was ruled by a Muslim descendant of Raja Sayed Khan of Nupur State. From the end of the 17th century, this region was the part of the princely state – Nurpur and was ruled by the Rajputs. Nurpur state was established by Rana Bhet, a Taur Rajput of Delhi, who is well known as Jatpal. Jatpal established his dynasty at Pathankot and took the control of whole country in the foot of the hills. In the end of the 17th century, he shifted his capital to Nurpur. Now Pathankot is a district of Indian Punjab, located in the north zone of the state. Pathankot city is the district headquarters. The district was created on 27 July 2011. In Mughal records it was known as Paithan, an abbreviation of Pratishthan from which the Pathania Rajputs derive their name. Pathania is the name of the branch of the Tomara Clan of Chandravanshi, Rajputs, who claim a mythological descent from Arjuna, the hero of Mahabharata . They mostly live in and around Himachal Pradesh, in North India. It was an ancient traditional custom of the Rajputs for the king, almost in all instances, to take his name from the name of the country where he exercised his dominion. The capital was shifted from Pathankot to Dhameri Nurpur during the reign of Raja Basu Dev 1580–1613. [1] [2]
History of Pathania Rajput[ edit ]
Rana Jethpal, the younger brother of King Anangpal II of Delhi , came to Jallandhar Doab (also called Bist Doab) to conquer a territory for himself. After crossing the Beas river he captured a fort called Bhet, therefore acquiring the name Rana Bhet. After this he came upon the city of Pathankot (possibly ancient Pratisthana), and following the tradition of Rajputs, in which the king typically took his name from the name of the country where he exercised his dominion, he became known as a Pathania Rajput, instead of as a Tomara.
The Kingdom of Nurpur had its ca The goal is now competing for top goal of this season.
Chirag United Club Kerala[ edit ]
The I-League football team Chirag United Club Kerala (erstwhile Viva Kerala) played their home matches in the stadium for the 2011–12 I-League season .
2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup[ edit ]
On 5 December 2013, the FIFA Executive Committee chaired by FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter decided that host of 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup will be India [11] upon evaluation of bid sent by AIFF with Kochi as one of the eight possible venues. [12] Later, Chief Minister of Kerala Mr.Oommen Chandy stated that they will soon sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Sports Ministry in that regard after an exclusive cabinet meet on the issue. [13] Government has appointed senior IAS officer Mr. APM Mohammed Hanish as Nodal Officer as per Fifa's direction. [14]
On December 11, 2014, FIFA team inspected the stadium and emphasised to improve the quality of pitch and need of bucket seats in the second tier of the stadium. With Kochi registering an average crowd of 47000 for ISL, the city has gathered attention from the authorities in terms of attracting crowd.
On 6 April 2015, AIFF cleared Kochi as one of the venues after receiving FIFA's technical committee report. Delhi, Mumbai, Guwahati, Goa and Kolkata are the other venues. [5]
Kerala Strikers[ edit ]
The Celebrity Cricket League team Kerala Strikers is playing its home matches in the stadium since 2012.
Future[ edit ]
With the undergoing construction of Kerala Cricket Association Stadium , not far from the venue, and another 50,000 seater Trivandrum International Stadium already in place with arguably better infrastructure to be used for cricket, it is likely that the Kaloor Stadium will become a football specific stadium in the future.
As of now, the Kerala cricket association is the only state cricket association that does not own a cricket stadium. [15] Once the new stadium is constructed, it is expected that KCA will shift its base from the Kaloor Stadium to the new venue. However the new stadium proposed to be built at Edakochiis currently facing problems from environmental activists who feel that the construction of the stadium could have adverse effects on the environment.

Career[ edit ]
Throughout his international career, Moin had to compete with another wicket-keeper, Rashid Latif . Moin kept wickets in the 1992 Cricket World Cup which Pakistan won and the 1999 Cricket World Cup where Pakistan finished runners up. Latif kept wickets in the 1996 Cricket World Cup and the 2003 Cricket World Cup . Despite close rivalries, Moin is mostly remembered as the better player as their performance after the glove-work came onto how they batted. Despite having a significantly similar Test batting average, Moin had a higher ODI average than Latif and scored more runs than Latif in international cricket. However, Moin had the keeping record of 2.14 dismissals per test against Latif 3.51 per test. Moreover, in all time Pakistani XI Latif picks as wicket-keeper and hence 69 test matches of Moin is a question mark in rashid latif tenure.
During the 1992 Cricket World Cup Semi-final against New Zealand, Pakistan needed 9 runs for 8 balls before Moin Khan hit a six to make it 3 runs off 7 balls. Then, Javed Miandad scored the winning boundary and Pakistan set up a clash in the world cup final with England. In the world cup final, Pakistan were 249 from 50 overs with Moin Khan not getting a chance to bat. However, he took three catches in the match including one of Ian Botham who went for a duck against an inswinger bowled by Wasim Akram . [3]
In 2005, Moin scored the first century in Pakistan domestic Twenty20 cricket when he smashed 112 off 59 balls for Karachi Dolphins against Lahore Lions in the ABN-AMRO Twenty-20 Cup . At the end of the season, he retired from cricket finishing with 200 not out against Hyderabad, his highest first class score.
In 2007, Moin signed with the unofficial Indian Cricket League and coached the Hyderabad Heroes . In the 2008 edition of the competition, he coached the expansion team, the Lahore Badshahs .
Coaching career[ edit ]
Moin was appointed the manager of the team in August 2013. [4] He was appointed as the new head coach of the national team on February 11, 2014, replacing Dav Whatmore . [5]
He was appointed chief selector for the Pakistani team in 2013. But in 2015, during the Cricket World Cup 2015 he was removed from the position.[ citation needed ]

Surya Prakash Chaturvedi (born 7 November 1937 in Indore , Madhya Pradesh ) is a Cricket critic, writer and historian. [1] He is a former professor of English at the Government Arts and Commerce College, Indore, where he taught for 35 years. He played cricket at the collegiate level, representing Indore University and Christian College, Indore as a middle order batsman. So far he has authored 11 books on the subject, all in Hindi.

Early career[ edit ]
As a teenager Godfrey Evans was a good all-round sportsman, gaining his colours and captaining the cricket, football and hockey teams at Kent College , Canterbury. He was also a very good boxer, winning all his amateur and professional fights, but at the age of 17 was forced by the Kent committee to choose between cricket and boxing. [1] He worked on the ground staff at Dover in 1937, operating the scoreboard on the occasion that Kent made 219 runs in 71 minutes to beat Gloucestershire. [2]
He made his Kent debut on 22 July 1939 against Surrey at Blackheath. He made 8 in the first innings as the match ended in a draw. World War 2, during which he was in the Royal Army Service Corps, interrupted his career but a strong first season back in 1946 earned him a Test call-up. [3]
Test career[ edit ]
First Test and tour[ edit ]
Evans made his Test debut in 1946 against India , when he was chosen for the third Test at The Oval , replacing Paul Gibb . In a largely rain affected contest he didn't bat or take any dismissals. [4]
Evans was selected as a member of Wally Hammond 's side to tour Australia in 1946/47 . After Gibb had played the first Test, Evans got his chance in the second at Melbourne. Australia won the match by an innings having scored 659/8 declared in their first innings, in 173 overs of English bowling Evans failed to concede a single bye , with Wisden commenting he 'kept wicket magnificently'. [5] Evans didn't concede a bye in Australia's first innings of 365 at Adelaide in the third Test either, this took the tally past 1,000 runs before he conceded his first bye in Ashes Tests. [6] In the Fourth Test at Adelaide , Evans shared in a vital ninth wicket partnership with Denis Compton , England were in danger of losing the Test at 255/8 but Evans played a fine defensive innings, scoring 10 not out in 133 minutes, this enabled Compton to complete his second century of the match and Hammond the chance to declare. Evans took 97 minutes before scoring his first run, a Test record which stood until 1999 when beaten by Geoff Allott . [7]
A short tour of New Zealand followed the Ashes series; rain heavily affected the only Test match, but in the MCC 's tour match against Otago Evans completed his maiden first-class century. His innings of 101 came from 170 runs which were scored while he was at the wicket with Jack Ikin . [8]
Ever present[ edit ]
In the 1947 home series with South Africa , Evans played in all five Tests scoring 209 runs at 41.80 and taking 14 dismissals. In the first Test at Trent Bridge he scored his maiden Test fifty with an innings of 74 that contained 14 fours. [9] In the fifth Test at The Oval, Evans had scores of 45 and 39 not out, the second innings came in 29 minutes as England looked to score quick runs before a declaration. [10]
England toured the West Indies in January 1948, Evans as first choice keeper played all four Tests scoring 128 runs at 18.28 and claiming seven victims. [11] Of his series performance Wisden wrote: "Evans delighted the native crowds with his spectacular wicket-keeping, but as a batsman he accomplished little". [12]
During the 1948 Ashes Evans was once again an ever-present, scoring 188 runs at 26.85 and taking 12 dismissals. [11] His most notable act of the series were two missed stumpings as Australia successfully chased down, a Test record, 404 in the fourth Test at Headingley . The first chance occurred when Arthur Morris was on 32 (he would score 182), the second chance when Donald Bradman was on 108; he finished with 173 not out. [13]
Drop and return[ edit ]
On the tour of South Africa in 1948/49 Evans was dropped after 22 consecutive Tests, a record sequence for a wicket-keeper at that time. [14] He did play the first three Tests but after scoring 49 runs in five innings was replaced for the final two Tests by Billy Griffith . Evans regained his place in the team for the home series against New Zealand in 1949, in the four Test series which ended 0–0 Evans scored 61 runs in four innings and took 12 dismissals. [11]
West Indies were the tourists in 1950 , in the first Test at Old Trafford , Evans made his maiden Test century. He came to the wicket with England 88/5 in the first innings, but together with Trevor Bailey they recovered the innings with a partnership of 161 runs. Evans score of 104 contained 17 fours with Wisden commenting that he "neglected no opportunity to hit hard". [15] In the third Test Evans added a fifty, his score of 68 coming from 83 added while he was at the wicket, the batting performance coming after he had conceded just two byes in West Indies' first innings total of 558. England lost the match by 10 wickets, a second successive defeat. [16] A broken thumb stopped Evans from playing in the fourth Test of the series; his replacement, Arthur McIntyre , scored 4 and 0 as England sustained an innings defeat to lose the series 3–1. [17]
Second Ashes tour[ edit ]
Evans is a grand keeper. On this tour he proved that he is the outstanding keeper in the world today. I have never seen a better keeper than Tallon as he was in England in 1948 ...but that time has passed. Evans is now the world best. That's the way things go and the way we Australians are supposed to like it. Evans reminds me always of a fox terrier . He simply cannot stand still whilst on the cricket field. He moves with short, quick steps, dives, literally dives, at the ball when it is returned badly out of his reach... – Bill O'Reilly [18]
Evans was back in the England team for the 1950/51 Ashes , although McIntyre did remain in the XI, as a specialist batsman, for the first Test. In the Brisbane match Evans took two noteworthy catches, the first from a Neil Harvey leg glance off the bowling of Alec Bedser , he moved so quickly to the leg side, that according to Neville Cardus , he made the catch look easy. [19] The second dismissal was off the bowling of Freddie Brown , a Sam Loxton cut struck Evans on the gloves and rebounded forward, Evans dived headlong catching the ball inches above the ground. [20] In the second Test at Melbourne, England were 126/7 in their first innings in response to Australia's 194. Evans, batting at nine , scored 49 which enabled a first innings lead although he failed in the second innings as England unsuccessfully chased 179. [21] Australia won the next two Tests so arrived back at Melbourne for the fifth and final Test with the chance of completing a Whitewash , however this was averted with an eight wicket win by England. This was, at the fourteenth attempt, Evans' first time on the winning side in an Ashes Test. [22] It also marked Australia's first post-war defeat in their 26th Test. [23]
The end of series report in Wisden commented that: "Evans did not miss one Test catch, but he caught some which became chances only through lightning mental reaction plus acrobatic agility" commenting on his batting added: "Evans played one praiseworthy innings in the second Test but in others inability to curb his natural ebullience caused him to do less than justice to his talents." [24]
The tour ended with a two Tests in New Zealand, Evans played both matches his most noteworthy act occurred in the second Test at Wellington where he conceded 30 byes in New Zealand's second innings total of 189. [25] This was, and remained, the highest number of byes he conceded in a Test innings. [26]
1951[ edit ]
At the start of the 1951 season Evans was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for his performances in the 1950 season, the other four recipients of the award – Sonny Ramadhin , Alf Valentine , Everton Weekes and Frank Worrell – were members of the victorious West Indian tourists. [27]
The 1951 home Test series with South Africa proved to be a poor one for Evans, who was dropped for the final two Tests of the summer having scored just seven runs in the first three Tests. His keeping was not up to his usual standards either, in the South Africa second innings at Old Trafford he conceded 13 byes, significant in a low score of 191. [28]
An MCC 'A' team toured India that winter and Evans was approached, however he declined the invitation believing that the constant cricket of the past five years had been the cause for his drop in form.
Batting at his best[ edit ]
Evans would play India the following year, as he returned to the Test team for the home series between the two countries. In the first Test at Leeds, Evans scored 66 in 97 minutes, a vital innings as England were 182/5 when Evans came to the wicket responding to India's 293. England won the match by seven wickets after India collapsed to 0/4 in their second innings. [29] The second Test at Lord's was a significant match for Evans with bat and gloves. In India's first innings Evans took what Wisden described as a "brilliant stumping off a ball which had turned sharply towards the slips", [30] the dismissal was Evans' 100th at Test level, he became the first English wicket-keeper to reach the landmark and the second keeper after Bert Oldfield . [31] In England's response Evans scored his second Test century, scoring 104 in 135 minutes with 16 boundaries, his scoring was so quick that he nearly reached 100 in a session, he lunched on 98 not out. He shared a 159-run sixth wicket partnership with Tom Graveney as England scored quickly to build a 302-run first innings lead. England won the match by eight wickets despite Vinoo Mankad scoring 184 in the second innings. [32]
Evans good batting form continued to the third Test at Old Trafford, where he passed 50 for a third successive Test innings. Again he demonstrated his quick scoring abilities with an innings of 71 in 78 minutes, the other England batsman were more cautious and the total progressed by only 84 while Evans was batting. England dismissed India for 58 and 82 to win the match and the series. [33] The final Test at The Oval was a rain affected draw, Evans scored one to finish the series with an aggregate of 242 runs at 60.50, with the gloves he took eight dismissals. [11]
Ashes success[ edit ]
In the first Test of the 1953 Ashes , Evans took two catches off the bowling of Trevor Bailey as Australia collapsed from 237/3 to 247 all out. In England's innings he scored eight runs batting at eight, as England totalled 144. The match was drawn after rain heavily disrupted the final two days.

Marsh batting for WA in the 2007-08 KFC Twenty20 Big Bash final.
In October 2002, Marsh was named to play for Western Australia against the touring English XI in a two-day practice match (not classified as first-class) prior to the 2002–03 Ashes . Marsh top scored for the match with 92 runs against an English bowling attack consisting of Matthew Hoggard , Stephen Harmison , Andy Caddick and Ashley Giles . [6] He was not selected for the three-day match held soon after, but was selected to make his List A debut for the Warriors in an ING Cup match against South Australian Redbacks in November 2002. [7] Marsh would play in nine ING Cup games and three Pura Cup during the 2002–03 season and he made his maiden first-class hundred against a NSW side featuring Steve and Mark Waugh in 2003. [8]
Over the next few years, he cemented his position in the Warriors middle order, averaging over 35 in first class cricket in 2004–05 and 2005–06. [9] He was named in the Australia-A side for a mid-year tournament in Cairns in July 2006. After a relatively poor 2006–07 season, he returned to top form in 2007–08 in all forms of the game. In first-class cricket, he made his highest career score of 166 not out (as part of a 268 run 4th-wicket partnership with Luke Pomersbach and averaged over 60 runs per completed innings. [9] In the 2007–08 Ford Ranger Cup 50-over competition, Marsh made his debut century and was the Warriors' top run scorer. [10] In Twenty20 cricket, he was the competition's leading run scorer with the highest average and the highest individual score. [11]
Partway through the 2007–08 seasoswerved in from round the stumps and skidded on to collect the edge from an attempted cut. de Villiers reeled off a few big shots but was trapped by Shadab Jakati and Suresh Raina had Kohli lbw to sew up the game for Chennai.
In contrast Bangalore slipped on the little things that matter on this stage. In the Powerplay, there were three instances of fielders succumbing to adrenalin rushes and indulging in needless throws; one, from Saurabh Tiwary, even went to the boundary. Pomersbach could have done a better job in seizing that chance from Vijay in the 10th over, and S Aravind messed up an opportunity to run out Hussey in the 12th over. Vijay, the non-striker, had called Hussey for a risky single and Aravind, the bowler who picked up the ball at short mid-on, flung it wide at the non-striker's end. There was another instance in the 11th over when the bowler, Mohammad, flung himself full stretch to his right but couldn't hang on to a difficult chance offered by Vijay. It was that kind of day. Things just didn't go right for Bangalore and everything went according to script for Chennai.

Description[ edit ]
Dharamshala is a city in the upper reaches of the Kangra Valley and is surrounded by dense coniferous forest consisting mainly of stately Deodar cedar trees. The suburbs include McLeodGanj , Bhagsunath, Dharamkot, Naddi, ForsythGanj, Kotwali Bazaar (the main market), Kaccheri Adda (government offices such as the court, police, post, etc.), Dari, Ramnagar, Sidhpur, and Sidhbari (where the Karmapa is based).
The village of McLeodGanj, lying in the upper reaches, is known worldwide for the presence of the Dalai Lama . On 29 April 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama ( Tenzin Gyatso ) established the Tibetan exile administration in the north Indian hill station of Mussoorie . In May 1960, the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) was moved to Dharamshala.
Dharamshala is the centre of the Tibetan exile world in India. Following the 1959 Tibetan uprising there was an influx of Tibetan refugees who followed the 14th Dalai Lama. His presence and the Tibetan population has made Dharamshala a popular destination for Indian and foreign tourists, including students studying Tibet.
One of the main attractions of Dharamshala is Triund hill. Jewel of Dharamshala, Triund is one day trek at the upper reaches of McLeodGanj, about 9 km from McLeodGanj.
Etymology[ edit ]
Dharamshala ( Devanagari : धर्मशाला; ITRANS : Dharmashaalaa; IAST : Dharmaśālā) is a Hindi word (derived from Sanskrit ) that is a compound of dharma (धर्म) and shālā (शाला). A loose translation into English would be 'spiritual dwelling' or, more loosely, 'sanctuary'. Rendering a precise literal translation into English is problematic due to the vast and conceptually rich semantic field of the word dharma [1] and the cultural aspect of India.
In common Hindi usage, the word dharamshala refers to a shelter or rest house for spiritual pilgrims. Traditionally, such dharamshalas (pilgrims' rest houses) were commonly constructed near pilgrimage destinations (often in remote areas) to give visitors a place to sleep for the night. When the first permanent settlement was created in the place now called Dharamshala, there was one such pilgrims' rest house on the site, and the settlement took its name from that dharamshala. [2]
History[ edit ]
Before the Raj[ edit ]
From the earliest times until the British Raj, Dharamshala and its surrounding area was ruled by the Katoch Dynasty of Kangra . The Katoch Dynasty is said to be the oldest serving Royal Family in the world. [3] The Royal Family still keeps a residence in Dharamshala, known as 'Clouds End Villa'.
The indigenous people of the Dharamshala area (and the surrounding region) are the Gaddis , a predominantly Hindu group who traditionally lived a nomadic or semi-nomadic ( transhumant ) lifestyle. Due to the lack of permanent settlements in the area, some Gaddis lost their seasonal pastures and farmland when the British and the Gurkhas arrived to settle.
Settlement by the British and the Gurkhas[ edit ]
In 1848, the area now known as Dharamshala was annexed by the British.
"Dharamsāla lies on a spur of the Dhaola Dhār, 16 miles north-east of Kāngra, in the midst of wild and picturesque scenery. It originally formed a subsidiary cantonment for the troops stationed at Kāngra, and was first occupied as a station in 1849, when a site was required for a cantonment to accommodate a Native regiment which was being raised in the District. A site was found upon the slopes of the Dhaola Dhār, in a plot of waste land, upon which stood an old Hindu resthouse, or dharmsāla, whence the name adopted for the new cantonment. The civil authorities, following the example of the regimental officers, and attracted by the advantages of climate and scenery, built themselves houses in the neighbourhood of the cantonment; and in 1855 the new station was formally recognised as the headquarters of the [Kāngra] District." [4]
In 1860, the 66th Gurkha Light Infantry was moved from Kangra, Himachal Pradesh to Dharamshala, which was at first made a subsidiary cantonment . An ideal position for the new base was found on the slopes of the Dhauladhar Hills , near the site of a Hindu sanctuary, or Dharamshala, hence the name of the town. [5] [6] The Battalion was later renamed the historic 1st Gurkha Rifles , this was the beginning of the legend of the Gurkhas, also known as the 'Bravest of the Brave'. Consequently, fourteen Gurkha platoon villages grew from this settlement, and exist to this day, namely Dari, Ramnagar, Shyamnagar, Dal, Totarani, Khanyara, Sadher, Chaandmaari, Sallagarhi, Sidhbari , Yol , and so on. The Gurkhas worshipped at the ancient Shiva temple of Bhagsunag . The Gurkhas referred to Dharamshala as 'Bhagsu' and referred to themselves as Bhagsuwalas.
The 21st Gurkha Regiment from Dharamshala performed heroic feats during World War I and the North West Frontier Province campaigns. The Gurkha cantonment then reached its zenith during World War II, when battalions from Dharamshala made history. Many place names in the town still retain their former cantonment terminologies: Depot Bazaar, Pensioners' Lines, Tirah Lines (named after the 19th century Tirah Campaign ), Bharatpore Lines (named after the 1826 Battle of Bharatpore ).
The second Lord Elgin , Viceroy of India died here (at the 1st Gurkha Rifles Officers' Mess) in 1863 and is buried in the cemetery of St. s was also drawn, England went into the final day on 20/3 but were able to bat through to the close losing just four further wickets, Evans came to the wicket after the fall of the sixth wicket with sixty-five minutes of play left, but together with Freddie Brown they batted out the final overs, Evans finished on 11 not out. [35]
The third Test at Old Trafford followed the same course, ending in a draw after rain washed out the fourth day and much of the second, although it was an eventful match for Evans. In Australia's first innings he took three dismissals; however he dropped two earlier chances to dismiss Neil Harvey and Alan Davidson , [36] the miss of Harvey was costly as he went on to make 122, having been 52 at the time. [19] In England's innings, Evans scored a quick 44 not out in 39 minutes on what was at that stage a wet wicket. Evans took three further dismissals in Australia's second innings as they collapsed to 35/8. [37] At Leeds, more rain and England's defensive batting ensured a fourth draw of the series. Batting first England scored 167 in 109.4 overs, Evans's contribution was 25 runs in 90 minutes. Three England players suffered injuries during the course of the innings; the third of these was Bailey who twisted his knee as he attempted to make his ground after a mix up with Evans. Facing a 99-run deficit, England continued to bat slowly in their second innings adding 275 in 177.3 overs, Bailey batted over four hours with the tail on the final day to leave Australia one hour and fifty-five minutes to chase 177; they were 30 short when play ended. [38]
After four draws, the fifth and final Test at The Oval was the series decider. Australia, after winning the toss for the fifth time in the series, chose to bat first and scored 275, Evans taking four catches. England gained a first innings lead of 31; Evans innings of 28 included two hooked fours from a Ray Lindwall over. [39] England took control of the match on the third day as the Australian batsmen struggled against spinners Tony Lock and Jim Laker and were dismissed for 162. England completed an eight-wicket victory the next day to win the Ashes, which Australia had held since 1934. Evans finished the series with 117 runs at 23.40 and 16 dismissals. [11]
Retaining the Ashes[ edit ]
England toured the West Indies in 1953/54 , after losing the first two Tests England came back to draw the series 2–2 with wins in the third and fifth Tests. [40] Evans missed the fourth Test with an injury and was replaced by Dick Spooner , however Evans returned for the fifth Test where he played the longest innings of his career, batting 142 minutes for 28. Although not the largest innings of his career it was an important one as he shared a 108-run partnership with Len Hutton , whose double century built England a substantial first innings lead. [41] Evans finished the series with 72 runs at 12.00 and six dismissals. [11]
The tourists to England in 1954 were Pakistan , elected Test members two years previous they caused a shock by beating England in the final Test at The Oval to gain a series draw. [42] In a wet summer all four Test matches were affected by rain. Evans highest two scores of the series – 25 and 31 – came in the first and third Tests, which were both drawn. In the fourth Test he was promoted to number six in the batting order as England omitted Trevor Bailey and chose five specialist bowlers. It proved unsuccessful as England collapsed chasing 168, Wisden noting England's 'tail proved far too long for a Test Match'. [43] Evans scored 0 and 3 in his two innings, but by taking three catches he became the Test record holder for dismissals. A catch to take the wicket of Abdul Kardar was his 131st dismissal in Tests, taking him past the previous highest total of 130 by Bert Oldfield. [43] [44]
Evans made a third tour to Australia in 1954/55 . He missed the first Test, after failing to recover from sunstroke. His deputy, Keith Andrew , came into the team to make his Test debut. [45] Evans returned to the team for the second Test, but fared poorly with the bat scoring three and four. [46] In the third Test at Melbourne he added some useful runs, in the first innings he scored 20 in a 54-run sixth wicket stand with Colin Cowdrey , in the second he added 22. He took five catches in the match including a leg-side one to dismiss Neil Harvey which began Australia's collapse from 77/2 to 111 all out. [47] Neville Cardus described the catch: "Harvey flicked the seventh ball of the morning (from Tyson ) round the corner and this time Evans dived full length to the right, clutching the ball in his out-stretched glove". [19] In the fourth Test Evans made his highest score of the series, an innings of 37 in 36 minutes, sharing a 51-run partnership with Trevor Bailey. After Australia were dismissed for 111 in their second innings (for the second successive match), it set England a target of 94 to win the match. Evans came to the wicket with only four needed and with only one needed he scored a boundary that won the match and retained the Ashes. [48] The fifth and final Test was disrupted by heavy rain in New South Wales which had also led to the Hunter Valley floods . [49] The match was drawn after no play was possible until the fourth day, Evans scored 10 in England's innings and took two catches. [50]
In the four Tests he played Evans scored 102 runs and took 13 catches. [11] Wisden praised Evans, writing: "Always brimful of energy no matter how exhausting the heat of the day, he was an inspiration to the whole team and especially the bowlers." [51]
Third Ashes success[ edit ]
After the Ashes there was a two Test series in New Zealand, Evans had a poor tour with the bat, scoring ducks in both Tests. [52] In the intervening tour match with Wellington he also struggled, scoring one and a duck. [53]
In 1955, South Africa toured England for a five Test series. Evans played the first three matches before an injury forced him to miss the final two. England won the first Test at Trent Bridge by an innings; Evans contributed 12 runs in England's innings and took two catches, the second was his 150th Test dismissal. [54] In the second Test at Lord's Evans took seven dismissals, a record for his Test career. [55] England won the match despite having trailed by 171 runs on first innings. [56] During the third Test Evans fractured the little finger of his right hand in two places, Tom Graveney kept wicket in his absence. In England's second innings Evans, with hand in plaster, batted at number eleven and scored 36 runs including seven boundaries. [57] He shared a 48-run partnership with Trevor Bailey that increased South Africa's target from 97 to 145. It proved in vain though as the tourists reached the required total with three wickets remaining. [58]
Australia toured in 1956 and Evans was an ever present in the England side who won the Test series 2–1. [59] Evans scored 115 runs at 19.16, three of his seven innings were ducks. [60] His highest score came in the fourth Test at Old Trafford where he scored 47 in 29 minutes with five fours and two sixes. England won the match, and retained the Ashes, after Jim Laker's unprecedented 19 wickets. [61] Evans took nine dismissals in the series but seven of these came in one match – the second Test. [60]
Milestones[ edit ]
England toured South Africa in 1956/57 . Evans played in all five Tests of a series that was drawn 2–2. [62] In the second Test Evans scored 62 during England's first innings, he shared in a 93-run sixth wicket stand with Colin Cowdrey, it was the largest partnership of the match. [63] Evans innings was his first Test score of more than fifty runs since 1952. [11] When on four he reached a career total of 2,000 Test runs, [64] only the second wicket-keeper after Les Ames to achieve the milestone. [65] England led the series 2–1 but lost the final Test at Port Elizabeth in controversial circumstances. The match was played on a pitch that had been re-laid only three months previous, the wicket was slow and the ball kept 'exceptionally low' according to Wisden. [66] The match produced a scoring rate of 1.40, the lowest ever in a Test match. [67] Evans scored 21 in England's second innings but the tourists fell 58 runs short of their target. He also took six catches and in the difficult conditions conceded just one bye. Wisden commented that it was: "an extraordinary performance by an extraordinary man". [66] Evans took a total of 20 dismissals in the series, a record for his career. [11]
In 1957, the West Indies toured England for a five Test series. England dominated, winning 3–0 (all innings victories) and they were best placed in the two drawn matches. [68] Evans played in all five Tests, scoring 201 runs and taking 15 dismissals. [11] In the second Test at Lord's Evans scored 82 in 115 minutes, batting at number eight he shared a seventh wicket partnership of 174 in 115 minutes with Colin Cowdrey. [69] The stand was an English record for the wicket [70] and was the largest of Evans career. [71] In the fourth Test at Headingley Evans didn't concede a bye and by catching Collie Smith claimed his 200th Test dismissal, becoming the first to reach the landmark. [72]
New Zealand toured England in 1958 , the hosts won the five Test series 4–0, with three of those victories by an innings. [73] Evans was once again an ever present in the team but his batting was poor with 28 runs at an average 5.60. [11] Nevertheless he did break one record in the series, by playing the fifth Test at The Oval he made his 86th Test appearance passing the previous record held by Wally Hammond . [74]
Final Tests[ edit ]
Evans made his fourth tour to Australia in 1958/59 , but it was a disappointing one for him and the team. England went into the series as favourites, having won the previous three Ashes series, but lost convincingly 4–0. [75] Evans played three Test matches, missing the third with a finger injury and, despite his returning for the fourth, a recurrence of that injury resulted in his missing the fifth. With the bat Evans scored 27 runs in six innings, four of which totalled only four runs. [76] Wisden wrote that Evans was among several established players who showed a 'decline in power'. [75]
In 1959, India toured England, in the first home series since the Ashes defeat a number of experienced players were dropped. [77] However, Evans remained and in the first Test of the summer he justified his selection with a run-a-ball innings of 73, which contained 12 boundaries. Norman Preston in Wisden described it as 'daring hitting' which 'reduced the hitherto keen Indian bowling to a thing of shreds and patches'. [77] In the second Test at Lord's Evans missed four stumpings off Tommy Greenhough in the space of a quarter of an hour, [78] he otherwise kept well and didn't concede a bye in the match. [79] Evans was dropped from the team for the next Test 'in the interests of team building', the reason given by the selectors. [80] His England test cap number is 315. [81]

Early life and career[ edit ]
Bedser was born in Reading , Berkshire , ten minutes after his identical twin brother Eric (1918–2006). His father was a bricklayer, but had been stationed in Reading with the Royal Air Force during the First World War. The brothers remained inseparable through their lives: they often dressed identically, and shared a bank account; neither married. [1] [2]
Within six months the family moved to Horsell , Surrey , where, at the age of seven, the brothers played their first organised cricket. The family moved to Knaphill, Surrey and then to a house they helped their father to build in Woking . They were educated at Maybury Junior School and then Monument Hill Central School in Woking. Over the next decade, the twin brothers played cricket together for Monument Hill School and Woking Cricket Club. They also both played football for Monument Hill School, both as full backs . [2]
After leaving school, Eric and Alec became clerks at the same firm of solicitors in Lincoln's Inn Fields . They were spotted practising in the nets for Woking Cricket Club by Surrey coach Alan Peach , and he recruited them to the staff at the Oval in 1938. Initially, they were both medium-fast bowlers , but (after Alec won a toss of a coin) Eric became an off spinner instead. They made their first-class débuts for Surrey against Oxford University in June 1939.
Second World War[ edit ]
Their cricket careers were soon interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War. They both joined the RAF police, and were sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force . They both narrowly escaped being shot before being evacuated from Dunkirk , and later served in North Africa , Italy and Austria . [3]
Eric was promoted to Warrant Officer , but Alec refused a similar promotion, staying a flight sergeant so they could continue to serve together. They were demobilised in 1946.
Playing career[ edit ]
Alec Bedser founded England's eventual success. He toiled for hours without complaint, and never once looked annoyed at the missing of a catch, or at a rejected l.b.w. appeal. A great bowler, and an example to all who aspire to cricketing fame. The schoolboys who cheered him, and the elderly folk who applauded politely, all realised one thing. In Alec Bedser England had the best bowler Australia had seen for years, and friend and foe alike admitted the fact. [4]
John Kay
Alec Bedser's performances during war-time cricket matches were impressive: in games for the RAF he took 6 wickets for 27 runs (including a hat-trick ) against the West Indies and 9 for 36, featuring another hat-trick, against a Metropolitan Police team.
In his first full season for Surrey, in 1946, he passed 100 wickets before July and established himself as a bowler in the England Test team. In each of his first two Tests, against the visiting Indians , he took eleven wickets: 11 for 139 in his début at Lord's , including 7 in the first innings, [5] and 11 for 96 in the next game at Old Trafford , Manchester . His amazing season resulted in his nomination as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1947. He was selected for the 1946-47 Ashes series in Australia and for most of the next decade "carried England's bowling attack". [6]
In Australia he was overbowled and exhausted and found that his natural in-swingers were liked by Australian leg-side batsmen like Sid Barnes . To counter this he gripped the ball across the seam like a spinner and the result was an in-swinging leg-break which would be known as Bedser's "Special Ball". [7] Don Bradman wrote "the ball with which Alec Bedser bowled me in the Adelaide Test Match was, I think, the finest ever to take my wicket. It must have come three-quarters of the way straight on my off-stump, then suddenly dipped in to pitch on the leg stump, only to turn off the pitch and hit the middle and off stumps." [8]
Meanwhile, his brother Eric became an all-rounder in the Surrey team, concentrating on his batting as the team also included spinners such as Jim Laker and Tony Lock . The two were difficult to tell apart, both 6'3" tall and just over 15 stone. Playing for Surrey against an England representative team in 1946, they are reputed to have shared an over - Alec bowling the first three balls and then swapping with Eric fielding at mid-on for Eric to complete the over - without being detected by the batsman, Frank Woolley .
In the 1950-51 Ashes series , Alec began his dominance of Australian batsmen, taking 30 wickets at an average of 16.06 and 10 for 105 in the Fifth Test when he ended Australia's unbeaten run of 26 Tests since 1938. In 1953 at 35, an age by which many fast bowlers have retired from first-class cricket, Bedser demonstrated his longevity by helping England regain the Ashes. He took 39 wickets at an average of 17.48 at home to Australia, including career-best match figures of 14 for 99 in the Nottingham Test.
Bedser founded his success on accuracy of line and length, bowled at a medium pace from a short run-up, using his powerful shoulders and large hands to achieve sharp inswing and surprising batsmen with occasional leg cutters .
Bedser was aged 36 bJohn in the Wilderness , a small Anglican church distinguished by its stained-glass windows. Dharamshala became a popular hill station for the British working in or near Delhi , offering a cool respite during the hot summer months.
"Before the earthquake of 1905, the upper part of the station, which rises to a height of 7,112 feet [2,168 metres], contained the European houses, the station church, and the officers' mess and lines of the 1st Gurkhas, together with the public gardens, post office, and two bazars, the Forsythganj and McLeodganj. The public offices, a bazar, and a few European houses made up the lower station, as low as 4,500 feet [1,372 metres]. The 1st battalion of the 1st Gurkhas used to be stationed here, but was moved to the upper station in 1894-5.... The public gardens, which were, before the earthquake, laid out with much taste in lawns and terraces, contained a valuable collection of indigenous and imported trees and shrubs, and were overlooked by the Assembly Rooms, a handsome building comprising a public hall, a library and reading-room and a billiard-room. The church was beautifully situated in a recess of the mountain." [7]
In 1905, the Kangra valley suffered a major earthquake. On April 4 of that year, the earth shook, demolishing much of the cantonment and the neighbouring city of Kangra, Himachal Pradesh as well as the Bhagsunag temple. Altogether, the 1905 Kangra earthquake killed 20,000 people. "1,625 persons perished at Dharamsāla alone, including 15 Europeans and 112 of the Gurkha garrison."." [8]
The Gurkhas rebuilt the town along with the temple, which today is acknowledged as the 1st Gurkha Rifles' heritage. The British had planned to make Dharamshala the summer capital of India, but moved to Shimla after the disaster.
Not only did the Gurkhas of Dharmshala make a major contribution to India's defence, many were freedom fighters for the Indian National Army , which had been founded by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose . The Indian National Army Captain Ram Singh Thakur , a Gurkha from the village of Khanyara, composed some of India's most popular and stirring patriotic songs, including " Kadam Kadam Badaye Ja ". He is acknowledged so by the Netaji Research Bureau, Kolkata. The important contribution of the noted Gurkha social commentator, the late Master Mitrasen Thapa, from the village of Totarani, has been acknowledged by the Himachal Pradesh government. Recently, a park dedicated to the memory of the late Brigadier Sher Jung Thapa, MVC, the 'Hero of Skardu', has been opened alongside the road between Lower and Upper Dharamshala.
Establishment of Tibetan exile community[ edit ]
The main street in McLeodGanj
The Tibetan settlement of Dharamshala began in 1959, when His Holiness the Dalai Lama had to flee Tibet and the Prime Minister of India allowed him and his followers to settle in McLeodGanj (in Upper Dharmshala), a former colonial British summer picnic spot. There they established the " government-in-exile " in 1960 and the Namgyal Monastery . Dharamshala had been connected with Hinduism and Buddhism for a long time, many monasteries having been established there in the past, by Tibetan immigrants in the 19th century.
Library of Tibetan Works and Archives
In 1970, The Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, opened the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives which houses over 80,000 manuscripts and other important resources related to Tibetan history, politics and culture. It is considered one of the most important institutions for Tibetology in the world, the new director is Geshe Lahkdor, the old translator of H.H. the Dalai Lama.
Today[ edit ]
Several thousand Tibetan exiles have now settled in the area, and most live in and around McLeodGanj in Upper Dharamshala, where they have built monasteries, temples and schools. McLeodGanj is sometimes known as 'Little Lhasa ", after the Tibetan capital city, or 'Dhasa' (a compound of 'Dharamshala' and 'Lhasa'). It has become an important tourist destination with many hotels and restaurants, leading to growth in tourism and commerce.
Dharamshala is the winter capital of Himachal Pradesh. The Legislative Assembly is at Sidhbari , near the Chinmaya Tapovan Ashram , and the winter sessions of the Government are held there.
Transcription and pronunciation[ edit ]
Due to a lack of uniform observance of transliteration and transcription conventions for Hindi (and the Devanagari script in which Hindi is written), the name of the town has been transcribed into English (and other languages using Romanic scripts ) variously as Dharamshala, Dharamsala and, less frequently, Dharmshala and Dharmsala. [2] These four permutations result from two variables: the transcription of the word धर्म (dharma)—particularly the second syllable (र्म)—and that of the third syllable (शा).
A strict transliteration of धर्म as written would be 'dharma' [ˈdʱərma]. In the modern spoken Hindi of the region, however, there is a common metathesis in which the vowel and consonant sounds in the second syllable of certain words (including धर्म) are transposed, which changes 'dharma' to 'dharam' (pronounced somewhere between [ˈdʱərəm] and [ˈdʱərm], depending on the speaker). Thus, if the goal of the transcription is phonetic accord with modern spoken Hindi, then 'dharam' and 'dharm' are both legitimate options.
Regarding the third syllable, the Devanagari श corresponds to the English sh sound, [ ʃ ]. Thus शाला is transcribed in English as 'shala'.
Therefore, the most accurate phonetic transcription of the Hindi धर्मशाला into Roman script for common (non-technical) English usage is either 'Dharamshala' or, less commonly, 'Dharmshala', [9] both of which render the sh (/ʃ/) sound of श in English as 'sh' to convey the correct native pronunciation, 'Dharamshala' [dʱərəmˈʃaːlaː] or 'Dharmshala' [dʱərmˈʃaːlaː]). Nonetheless, the alternate spelling 'Dharamsala' continues to be used in some cases despite its inaccuracy, and all four spelling permutations can be found in the English language materials of the local and state governments, in publications, and on the Internet. [10]
Regardless of spelling variations, the correct native pronunciation is with the sh sound (/ʃ/). [11] In actual practice, the spelling variant that is most common and most concordant with standards of transcription and native pronunciation is 'Dharamshala'. The official Indian English spelling is 'Dharamshala'.
Demographics[ edit ]
As of the 2001 [update] India census , [12] Dharamshala had a population of 19,124. Males constitute 55% of the population and females 45%.

Powerplay 1: Overs 0.1 - 6.0 (Mandatory - 41 runs, 2 wickets)ket World Cup[ edit ]
Raina was on the bench through the first half of the 2011 Cricket World Cup as captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni instead went with the in-form Yusuf Pathan . This remained so until the group game against West Indies, which Raina played in place of an injured Virender Sehwag. Against defending champions Australia in the quarter-final, Dhoni made a strategic change, omitting Yusuf Pathan in favour of Raina. Raina responded by assisting Yuvraj Singh in a successful run chase through high pressure, making 34 from 28 balls to carry India to victory. In the semi-final against Pakistan, he batted with tailenders to score an unbeaten 36, a significant contribution to India's final tally of 260. He also took Younis Khan's catch off of Yuvraj's bowling. Suresh Raina played some crucial knocks in quarter-final and semi-final of the World Cup, which helped India to win the 2011 ICC Cricket worldcup. Gary Kirsten, the then coach of India, said 'Raina won the World Cup for us with some crucial knocks'. [13]
Captaincy and 2011 West Indies tour[ edit ]
India toured West Indies after the World Cup with captain MS Dhoni rested and vice captain Virender Sehwag injured. Gautam Gambhir was named captain for the One dayers and T20's with Raina as his deputy. But due to injury Gambhir was ruled out, with Raina captaining with Harbhajan as his deputy. India won the series, but Raina averaged just 16.4. In the Test matches he scored 232 runs at the average of 46.4 scoring crucial fifties in each Test. His captaincy was highly appreciated by former west-Indian legends.
2011 tour of England[ edit ]
Raina was selected for the England tour in July. There was a lot of debate on who should play the first Test at Lord's, Yuvraj or Raina. But a century in a practice match against Somerset sealed a place for him in the playing eleven. Apart from a half-century in the first Test at Lord's, Raina managed just 27 runs from seven innings. He struggled against short bowling and in the final Test was out for a 29-ball duck, the longest in India's Test history. [14] [15]
Raina at the SCG in January 2015.
Raina running through a poor form in the Test series especially in the last match made some impactin the 5 match-ODI series though the team was unable to secure a win at all. He top-scored in a rain-affected game at the Lord's scoring a commendable 84 from 75 balls.
2012 Tour of Sri Lanka[ edit ]
In the first ODI, Raina played an attacking 45 ball, 50-run knock to help India reach 314. They eventually won the match by 21 runs on 21 July 2012.
In the second ODI he was out for 1 but he came back stronger in the third ODI where he played a blistering 45 ball 65 to hand India a five wicket win and he eventually also won the man of the match award for his performance. Gambhir too scored a century in that match. [16]
He continued his good form in the 4th ODI as he scored his 3rd half-century of the series and helped India beat Sri Lanka by 6 wicktes by scoring 58*.and mujeeb helped him
He was out for a duck in the last ODI.
After the Tour of Sri Lanka, When England team came to India, he was dropped and gave away his spot to Yuvraj Singh, Who made a come back after suffering from Cancer. [17]
2012-13 England tour of India[ edit ]
Raina registered strong performances in this series, which India won 3-2. He scored 277 runs at an average of 92.33 with four consecutive half centuries but only two of them in a winning cause. He became 13th Indian batsman to cross 4000 international runs, in his 159th ODI and got his first Man of the Series award in this format. At the end of the series, he broke into the ICC top 10 ranked batsmen for the first time in his career.
2014-15 tour of Australia[ edit ]
Suresh has been included into India's test squad after almost two years. Raina was selected in the final Test match at Sydney, under the captaincy of Virat Kohli. Later on, he announced his return to form in the Tri-Series with a flamboyant 51 against Australia.

Etymology[ edit ]
Coat of arms of Colombo from the Dutch Ceylon era, depicting a mango tree .
The name "Colombo", first introduced by the Portuguese in 1505, is believed to be derived from the classical Sinhalese name කොලොන් තොට Kolon thota, meaning "port on the river Kelani ". [12]
Another belief is that the name is derived from the Sinhalese name කොල-අඹ-තොට Kola-amba-thota which means "Harbour with leafy mango trees". [11]
The author of the oldest Sinhalese grammar, Sidatsangarava, written in the 13th century wrote about a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhalese. It lists naramba (to see) and kolamba (ford or habor) as belonging to an indigenous source . Kolamba may also be the source of the name of the commercial capital Colombo. [13] [14]
History[ edit ]
As Colombo possesses a natural harbour, it was known to Indian , Greeks , Persians , Romans , Arabs , and Chinese traders over 2,000 years ago. Traveller Ibn Batuta who visited the island in the 14th century, referred to it as Kalanpu. [15] Arabs, whose prime interests were trade, began to settle in Colombo around the 8th century AD mostly because the port helped their business by the way of controlling much of the trade between the Sinhalese kingdoms and the outside world. Their descendants now comprise the local Sri Lankan Moor community. [10] [16]

The first ever mention of Sri Lanka is seen in the great Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharat . The fortress was situated on a plateau between three mountain peaks known as the Trikuta Mountains. The ancient city of Lankapura is thought to have been burnt down by Lord Hanuman. After the King Ravana was killed by Rama with the help of the former's brother Vibhishana, Vibhishana was crowned King of Lankapura. The mythological Lankapuri or lanka is identified today as Sri Lanka. Lanka was originally ruled by a Rakshasa named Sumali. Later it was taken by Visarvana who was a Yaksha. From him, Rakshasa Ravana, took the rulership of Lanka. Rama killed Ravana and installed his brother Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka. According to both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the Yaksha king Vaisravana alias Kubera was the ruler of Lanka. His capital was guarded by Rakshasas. His half-brother Ravana (son of the sage Vishravaya and Sumali's daughter) fought with Kubera in battle and obtained the sovereignty of Lanka from him. Ravana ruled Lanka as the king of Rakshasas. Having sln, with the retirement of Justin Langer and the move of Chris Rogers to the Victorian Bushrangers , Marsh switched batting positions to become an opening batsman like his father Geoff. [12] At the end of the season, he was named the Lawrie Sawle Medallist for being the best player in the Western Australian state cricket team for the 2007–08 season. [13] He was highly sought after for the Big Bash League due to being regarded as one of the top domestic Twenty20 players in the world. He ultimately chose to stay in WA and play for the Perth Scorchers. After missing the first game due to a troublesome back, which played up in the recent Australian tour of South Africa, he played in the second match against the Melbourne Renegades and made 99* stating his case to join the test team for the Boxing Day Test against India and missed the next few games.
In October 2012, compounding a lean run of form, Marsh was dropped from the Perth Scorchers, and subsequently the Western Australian team, following an off-field indiscretion during the Champions League Twenty20 tournament in South Africa. [14]
A frank discussion with former teammate and new Western Australian coach Justin Langer helped Marsh regain his confidence and eventually his place in the state team:
He laid down the laws for me. It was a good chat. I knew exactly where I stood with him, and I went away with a new belief, in terms of where I wanted to head. It gave me a lot of confidence to know that if I went back and scored runs in grade cricket and 2nd XI, I could get back into the team straight away. [14]
Marsh has excelled in the Twenty20 format of cricket, and during the 2012–13 Big Bash League , he scored five half-centuries in nine innings, ending the tournament as the leading run scorer, and helping the Scorchers reach the final. [14] He carried this form upon his return to the Western Australian state team. Against Queensland , he scored 155 not out in the one-day game, and backed it up with 84 in the second innings of a come-from-behind victory at the Gabba. [14]
Indian Premier League career[ edit ]
Good form with the Western Warriors was rewarded with a contract in the 2008 Indian Premier League , where he opened the batting for the Kings XI Punjab . [15] Despite missing the opening four games of the tournament, Marsh scored the most runs in the league stage of tournament, including a century in the final league stage match against the Rajasthan Royals . He received the orange cap for scoring most runs in the 2008 IPL tournament. [16] [17] Shaun Marsh was chosen in the inaugural IPL dream team chosen by the cricketing website Cricinfo along with cricket superstars Sanath Jayasuriya , Kumar Sangakkara , Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne as well as other young talents like Rohit Sharma , Gautam Gambhir and Yusuf Pathan . [18]
International career[ edit ]
A graph of Shaun Marsh's ODI performance. The bars show the runs scored in each innings (blue bars indicate innings where he has been dismissed, orange bars indicate where he has remained not out). The red line shows the career batting average after each innings.
His excellent form during the 2007–08 season lead to Marsh being given a Cricket Australia Contract and being called up to the Australian Cricket tour of the West Indies . [19]
He made his debut for Australia in June 2008 in a Twenty20 game against the West Indies alongside fellow West Australian debutant, Luke Ronchi . Opening the batting with Ronchi, they compiled an opening partnership of 57 runs from the first 6 overs, with Marsh being dismissed soon after for 29 runs from 22 balls, including two sixes and a four. [20] He made a memorable One Day International debut a few days later, top scoring for the match with 81 runs from 97 balls and winning the Man of the Match award. [21] With the recent retirements of two of Australia's longest-serving ODI opening batsmen in Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden , Marsh was able to claim one of the opening batsmen positions for the 2008–09 season. [22] In the South African tour of Australia , Marsh performed well in the opening two ODI matches, top-scoring in both matches and winning the Man of the Match award in the second game. He has scored more than 50 in five of his 10 matches, [23] and scored his first century in the 5th ODI against India at Hyderabad on 5 November 2009.
Marsh was included in the Test cricket squad for Australia's tour of India in 2008 , but was not selected for a match. [24]
On 21 January 2011, in an ODI match against England at Hobart, Marsh scored his second ODI century (110) in a record ninth-wicket partnership with Doug Bollinger . Australia went on to win the match by 46 runs, and Marsh was named Player of the Match. [25] [26]
Test career[ edit ]
In July 2011, Marsh was selected for the Australian Test Squad for the tour to Sri Lanka and was presented with the baggy green by his father. [27] [28] Marsh made his Test cricket debut against Sri Lanka on 8 September 2011, and became the 19th Australian to score a century on Test debut. He scored 141 and shared a 258-run 4th wicket partnership with Michael Hussey , who scored 142. [29] He played one Test in Australia's following tour of South Africa , before missing three Tests with a back injury. [30] He played all four Tests in Australia's 2011–12 home series against India , but performed poorly, scoring only 17 runs at an average of 2.67, including three ducks . After continuing to show poor form at domestic level afterwards, he was dropped from the Test team. [31]
Marsh has not since secured a permanent place in the Test team, but since 2014 has been a fringe player who has filled in for an injured top-order batsman on several occasions. His first recall was in February 2014 as a replacement for Shane Watson in the first Test of Australia's 2013–14 tour of South Africa ; [32] he scored 148 runs in his first innings, the highest score of his career to date, but was dropped after after getting a pair in the second Test. He was recalled to the line-up in December 2014 for the home series against India after captain Michael Clarke tore his hamstring, [33] and scored 254 runs at 42.33 in three Tests. He played both Tests in the 2015 tour of the West Indies after Chris Rogers withdrew with concussion, [34] scoring 112 runs at 37.33. He toured with the Australian team throughout the subsequent 2015 Ashes series , playing well in tour matches but failing (with scores of 0 and 2) in the sole Test for which he was selected. [35]

Hosting[ edit ]
On 14 February, Sanjay Patel , who is the BCCI secretary, told the media after the IPL governing council meeting: "As far as possible our interest is to hold the IPL in India. Then, probably, South Africa is the preferred venue at the moment."[ citation needed ] The initial part of the season was held outside India, to avoid adding to the existing security demands for the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections . South Africa , Bangladesh and UAE were initially shortlisted as alternative venues. [8] [9] The BCCI working committee's meeting on 28 February decided that a final decision would be taken once the schedule for the general election was announced as the BCCI wanted to have as many matches as possible hosted in India due to pressure from the sponsors.

8.3 to Mishra, well, he just can't hold himself back, this Mohnish Mishra. He wasn't satisfied with four, he wanted a six, and was not mindful of the state of the game. Looks to get the front foot across, go down on a knee, and heave Murtaza against the spin over long on. Can't get enough on it, and Rohit Sharma on the boundary takes it. 52/5
14.2 to Uthappa, Pollard does a Jonty Rhodes. And then does a Flintoff. Uthappa's got to go, and he's perished to a fantastic catch. Murtaza sees him coming out, drops it just back of a length and forces Uthappa to heave down the ground despite not getting to the pitch. Uthappa could not time it well, and it seemed like he would hence be safe, since this was set to land some ten metres in front of long on. Try telling Pollard that. He runs forward and to his left, swoops in and plucks it when he is horizontal, inches off the ground. And then has the presence of mind to ensure he gets the hand under the ball when he lands. And then he gets up on his knees, puts his arms wide and stands like Flintoff as his team-mates charge in. Spectacular. 98/7



JSCA International Stadium , Ranchi
Qualifier 2 was played between Chennai and the Royal Challengers Bangalore . Dhoni won the toss and elected to bowl first expecting dew to play a part in the latter stages of the match, while Bangalore captain Virat Kohli wanted to bat first on what he believed was a dry pitch. [20] [21] Bangalore innings started off slowly and R Ashwin was introduced into the attack early with Chris Gayle at the crease. Nehra struck twice in the fifth over picking up the wickets of Kohli and AB de Villiers . [20] After losing another wicket, Bangalore steadied the innings with a 44-run partnership between Gayle and Dinesh Karthik . [22] In the 14th over, Gayle struck two consecutive sixes but, was dismissed caught and bowled by Raina, trying to hit a third. [20] Sarfaraz Khan then played a useful innings of 31 from 21 balls and lifted Bangalore's total to 139 for 8 in 20 overs. [22] In reply, Chennai lost the wicket of Smith early in their innings. In the tenth over, Yuzvendra Chahal claimed the wickets of du Plessis and Raina [20] and the score read 61 for 3. Dhoni then joined Hussey at the crease and the pair put on 47 runs for the fourth wicket, before Hussey was dismissed for 56. [22] Towards the end, Chennai lost three wickets within six balls, but managed to win the match off the penultimate ball of the innings with a single from Ashwin. [20] [22]
Background[ edit ]
The Final was played at the neutral venue of Eden Gardens , Kolkata . The 2013 Final between these two teams was also played at this venue where Mumbai had defeated Chennai by 23 runs to win their first IPL title. This was the seventh encounter between these two teams in the knockout/playoff stage of IPL, with Chennai leading 4–2 in such matches prior to this game. [6]
Chennai had the tournament's leading wicket-taker Dwayne Bravo in their ranks [8] but were without their best batsman of the season Brendon McCullum who was playing for New Zealand in England. [9] Mumbai's leading run-scorer Lendl Simmons was 90 runs behind the Orange Cap holder, [23] while their leading bowler Lasith Malinga was two wickets behind Bravo on the Purple Cap list. [8]
Report[ edit ]
The toss was won by Chennai who chose to bowl first. Their captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni described the pitch as being dry and predicted it would stay the same throughout the match. Mumbai captain Rohit Sharma said he wanted to bat first and post a good total to defend. Both teams were unchanged from their respective previous matches. [24]
Mumbai's innings began with opener Parthiv Patel being dismissed run out for a duck in the first over. [2] Rohit Sharma then joined Lendl Simmons at the crease and started aggressively, scoring 16 runs from the second over by Mohit Sharma . [3] The duo of Simmons and Sharma continued to attack the Super Kings bowlers with the former reaching his sixth half-century of the season. [3] Dwayne Bravo was introduced into the attack in the 12th over and Sharma was dismissed soon after completing his fifty which had come off just 24 balls. [3] Dwayne Smith then claimed the wicket of Simmons in the first ball of the following over, which was also Smith's first ball of the season. [3] Mumbai were at 120 for 3 in the 13th over, before Kieron Pollard and Ambati Rayudu struck boundaries at regular intervals, with the former striking three sixes and a four in the 17th over by Ashish Nehra . [3] Their partnership had reached 71 runs in less than seven overs [25] before Mohit Sharma dismissed Pollard off the final ball of the 19th over. [2] Mumbai lost Hardik Pandya for a duck in the final over, but were able to post 202 for 5 by the end of their innings. [2] This was the second 200-plus total in an IPL final. [3]
Chennai's run-chase got off to a slow start as Smith was struggling to time the ball. [3] Mitchell McClenaghan dismissed Michael Hussey in the fifth over for 4. [2] Suresh Raina then arrived at the crease and Smith started to score boundaries. Their partnership had reached 66 runs and was broken when Harbhajan Singh dismissed Smith for 57 in the 12th over. [2] Harbhajan got the wicket Raina in his next over, [3] after which Chennai lost a wicket in each of their following five overs with the required run rate increasing after every over. [2] McClenaghan and Lasith Malinga bowled economically in each of their four overs and had figures of 3 for 25 and 2 for 25 respectively. [2] Ravindra Jadeja and Mohit Sharma added 24 runs for the ninth wicket but their 20 overs ended 41 runs short of the target. [2]
Summary[ edit ]
It was Mumbai's second IPL title, making them the third team after the Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders to have won the IPL title more than once. [26] Rohit Sharma was awarded man of the match for his 26-ball 50. With 26 wickets in the tournament, Bravo finished as the leading wicket-taker and won the Purple Cap for the second time after the 2013 season . [8] Mumbai won a prize money of ₹15 crore for becoming the champions, while runners-up Chennai were awarded ₹10 crore. Chennai also won the Fair Play Award , while Mumbai were at the bottom of this table. [27]



Rules[ edit ]
The International Cricket Council state the official rules for Super Overs in the Standard Twenty20 International Match Playing Conditions, in effect from 1 October 2012. [11] [12] A Super Over determines the winner of matches ending with the scores tied according to the following rules:
Weather permitting, the Super Over will commence 10 minutes after the main match.Each team bats one over under the same restrictions as for the final over in a pool match.
The team batting second in the main match will bat first in the Super Over.
The bowler of the batting team can not both bat and bowl in the same super over
Each side has three nominated batsmen, meaning that the loss of two wickets ends the Super Over.
In the event of the scores being level in the Super Over, the first satisfied of the following criteria will determine the winner:
If the regular match utilised the Duckworth–Lewis method , criterion 4 immediately applies.
The team with the most number of boundaries combined from the main match and the Super Over is the winner.
The team with the most number of boundaries from the main match (that is, not including the Super Over) is the winner.
A count-back from the final ball of the Super Over shall be conducted. The team with the higher scoring delivery is the winner. Runs scored from illegal deliveries count towards the total for the following legal delivery.
Before 1 October 2010, Super Overs ending in a tie had the winner first decided by the number of boundary sixes the teams hit in both innings, then by the sixes hit in the main match. [13]
This rule was applied on 5 May 2010 in a 2010 ICC Women's World Twenty20 match between Australia and England , won by Australia by scoring more sixes in both innings. [14] [15] In the 2014 Indian Premier League , a Super Over used in a tied match between the Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight Riders was also tied as both teams scored 11 runs. The match was won by the Rajasthan Royals as they had hit more sixes during the main match.
Variations[ edit ]
In the 2014–15 season, the Big Bash League began using a variation of the rules, allowing each innings the full amount of 10 wickets. [16]
Example[ edit ]
Chris Gayle scored 25 runs in the first Super Over
The first implementation of Super Overs was in the tied Twenty20 match between the West Indies and New Zealand on 26 December 2008. West Indies scored 25/1 in their super over and New Zealand replied with 15/2. [17] This particular match was a trial of the Super Over concept, and the official result was a tie. [2]
The 26 December 2008 Twenty20 match between New Zealand and the West Indies was tied after each sides' 20 overs. [2]
- Daniel Vettori was the "nominated bowler" for New Zealand.
- Chris Gayle and Xavier Marshall opened the "mini-innings".
- Marshall was run out without facing a ball, and Shivnarine Chanderpaul similarly remained at the non-striker's end.
- Gayle hit 25 runs off the 6 balls he faced.
The Windies' "Super Over" score was 25 for 1 from six balls. [18]
- Sulieman Benn was the nominated bowler for the West Indies.
- NZ opener Jacob Oram was caught on Benn's third "super over" delivery.
- Third man in Ross Taylor hit a six but was then clean bowled on the next ball. Oram's "super over" opening partner Brendon McCullum didn't face a delivery.
The Black Caps' Super Over score was 15 for 2 (all out) from five balls. [18]
The West Indies thus won the Super Over.

Date last Updated:
2 September 2015
The Ashes series was the last for Australian captain Mark Taylor , who retired. Steve Waugh was appointed as Taylor's replacement, while Warne was promoted to the position of vice-captain. [39] However, he was dropped from the Test team during Australia's tour of the West Indies in early 1999. Warne took just two wickets in the first three Tests of the series, leading to calls from the Australian media for his removal from the team. [40] He was replaced for the final Test by off-spinner Colin Miller . Miller and MacGill took eight wickets between them as Australia won the Test to retain the Frank Worrell Trophy . [41] Warne's form recovered in the ODI series against the West Indies, and he was selected to play in the 1999 World Cup in the United Kingdom. [42] Just before the start of the World Cup, he was given a fine and a two-match suspended ban by the International Cricket Council for telling a newspaper about Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga that: "There is plenty of animosity between Arjuna and myself. I don't like him and I'm not in a club of one". [43]
Australia were seeking to win their first World Cup since 1987. Warne took 12 wickets in the preliminary phases of the tournament as Australia qualified for a semi-final against South Africa . While the match became notable for the dramatic fashion in which it finished, Warne was the man of the match, dismissing four key South African batsmen: Herschelle Gibbs , Gary Kirsten , Hansie Cronje and Jacques Kallis . [44] Australia faced Pakistan in the tournament's Final . Pakistan batted first, and were all out for only 132; Warne took 4/33. Australia chased down the target comfortably to win the World Cup. Warne was the tournament's joint top wicket-taker with Geoff Allott and was named the man of the match in the Final. [45]
After his World Cup performances, Warne was retained as Australia's vice-captain for the tours of Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe later in 1999. [41] The following Australian summer, he played in all Tests of the series against Pakistan and India. He reached his highest score with the bat in the first Test against Pakistan in Brisbane, with 86, before matching that score in the first Test against India in Adelaide the following month. [46] Warne's performances in the Brisbane Test were overshadowed by the Joe the Cameraman controversy, in which a jibe about the abilities of Australian bowler Scott Muller was picked up by an on-field microphone during the match. Channel Nine cameraman subsequently confessed to making the "can't bowl, can't throw" remark that many had believed was made by Warne. [47] Warne took 18 wickets over the six summer Tests and Australia won both series 3–0. [27] He then took another 15 wickets in Australia's 3–0 sweep of New Zealand in March 2000. [48] In the first Test of the series at Eden Park , he surpassed Dennis Lillee (with 355 wickets) as Australia's leading ever wicket-taker. [49]
Warne joined English county side Hampshire in 2000 and played for them during the year's English summer. Reports emerged that during the county season he had repeatedly sent lewd SMS messages to an English nurse. In August 2000, the Australian Cricket Board removed him as Australia's vice-captain, citing his history of indiscretions off the field. The Board's decision was contrary to the wishes of the team's selectors, including captain Steve Waugh . Warne was replaced as vice-captain by Adam Gilchrist . [50]
Wickets and injuries (2001–2003)[ edit ]
Warne missed the entire Australian summer of 2000–01 with a finger injury, and found himself battling Stuart MacGill and an in-form Colin Miller to be selected for Australia's tour of India in early 2001. [51] MacGill was ultimately the spinner left out. Warne took 10 wickets over the three-Test series at an average of 50.50. His Indian spin counterpart Harbhajan Singh was the man of the series with 32 wickets at an average of 17.03. [52] Australia lost the series 2–1. [53] In the northern summer of 2001, Warne made his third Ashes tour and took 31 wickets in the five-Test series , which Australia won 4–1. [54] He took three five-wicket hauls in the series. [55] In the final Test at The Oval he took 11 wickets across both innings, including the 400th wicket of his Test career ( Alec Stewart ). He became the sixth person and the first Australian in the history of cricket to reach the milestone. [56]
In the 2001–02 Australian summer, Australia played home series against New Zealand and against South Africa . Warne took six wickets in three Tests against New Zealand, and in the third Test in Perth made his highest career score with the bat in international cricket. He was caught at mid-wicket off the bowling of Daniel Vettori while on 99 runs, one run short of a maiden Test century. [57] He took 17 wickets in the three Tests against South Africa—more than any other player—including a five-wicket haul (5/113) in the first innings of the first Test. [58] [59] Warne was again the leading wicket-taker when Australia played a three-Test series in South Africa in February and March 2002, with 20 dismissals. [60] In February 2002, Ricky Ponting replaced Steve Waugh as captain of Australia's ODI squad. The elevation of Ponting—five years younger than Warne—appeared to extinguish any prospect of Warne ever being appointed to captain Australia. [61]
Australia played a three-Test series against Pakistan in October 2002, held in neutral Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates . Warne, who had lost weight over the previous months, took 27 wickets, was named the player of the series, and was man of the match in the first Test (with 11 wickets) and the third Test (with eight wickets). [62] [63] [64] [65] He returned to Australia for the Ashes series against England, starting in November 2002. He scored a half-century (57) with the bat in the first Test, before taking 11 wickets in the first three Tests of the series. However, in an ODI in December 2002, he suffered a shoulder injury. [66] The injury not only ruled him out of the remainder of the Ashes series, but put him in doubt for the World Cup , due to commence in February 2003. [67]
Ban from cricket (2003)[ edit ]
In February 2003, a day before the start of the World Cup , Warne was sent home after a drug test during a one-day series in Australia returned a positive result for a banned diuretic . [68] Warne claimed that he took only one of what he called a "fluid tablet" – the prescription drug Moduretic – given to him by his mother to improve his appearance. [69] A committee established by the Australian Cricket Board found Warne guilty of breaching the Board's drug code, and imposed a one-year ban from organised cricket. [70]
At the time, Warne took the view that the ban imposed would lengthen his Test playing career. [71] That Warne was allowed to play in charity matches while serving his one-year ban was criticised by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) [72] although WADA, in turn, was criticised by Warne for interfering in the matter. [73]
During his suspension, Warne was hired by the Nine Network , Australia's main free-to-air cricket broadcaster, as a TV commentator . [74] During the winter of 2003, he worked for the St Kilda Australian rules football club in an unpaid consultancy role, after the Australian Football League disallowed him from holding an official club position because of his drugs ban. [75] He also received invitations to play in various celebrity "park cricket" teams, and the newly renamed Cricket Australia reversed its decision on whether Warne, as a contracted player, should be allowed to play in such matches.
Return to cricket (2004–2006)[ edit ]
Warne returned to competitive cricket following his ban in February 2004. [76] In March, in the first Test of a three-Test series against Sri Lanka in Galle , he became the second cricketer after Courtney Walsh to take 500 Test wickets. [77] Warne took five wickets in each innings of the first and second Tests; a further six wickets in the third Test saw him named the player of the series. [78] He broke the record for most career wickets in Test cricket on 15 October 2004 during the second Test of Australia's series against India at Chennai . His dismissal of Irfan Pathan , caught at slip by Matthew Hayden , saw him overtake his Sri Lankan rival, Muttiah Muralitharan , with 533 wickets. Muralitharan, who was injured at the time, had taken the record himself from Courtney Walsh five months earlier. [79] [80] Australia won the series 2–1; it was Australia's first series win in India since 1969. Warne's 14 wickets at an average of 30.07 was a marked improvement on his previous performances in India, when in six Tests he had taken 20 wickets at an average of 52 runs each. [81] [82]
On 11 August 2005 at Old Trafford , in the Third Ashes Test, he became the first bowler in history to take 600 Test wickets, at a time when he separated with his wife at the time. In 2005, Warne also broke the record for the number of wickets in a calendar year, with 96 wickets. His ferocious competitiveness was a feature of the 2005 Ashes series, when he took 40 wickets at an average of 19.92 and scored 249 runs. Warne shared player of the series honour with England's Andrew Flintoff .
International retirement (2006–2007)[ edit ]

Warne began his 2006/07 Ashes campaign with an indifferent Test in Brisbane and a poor first innings showing in Adelaide. However, his second innings performance, including bowling Kevin Pietersen around the legs, triggered England's fifth-day collapse and Australia's victory. Warne again bowled well in the second innings in the third Test, and took the final wicket of Monty Panesar as Australia regained the Ashes.
On 21 December 2006 Warne announced his retirement, which came into effect after the fifth Ashes Test match at the SCG . He became the first cricketer to reach the 700-wicket milestone in his second last Test, on Boxing Day 2006. Warne said that it was his intention to "go out on top", adding that he might have retired after the 2005 Ashes series, had Australia won. Warne achieved his 700th test wicket at 3.18 pm on 26 December 2006 [83] ( AEST ) by bowling English batsman Andrew Strauss out at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , in what was almost certainly his final appearance at the ground. This was the first occasion that a player had taken 700 career wickets. The wicket was described as a "classic Warne dismissal" to which the crowd of 89,155 gave a standing ovation. [84]
Warne's final Test was held at the same venue as his first, 15 years earlier: the Sydney Cricket Ground . Warne ended England's first innings by trapping Monty Panesar lbw for a duck and his 1000th total international wicket. His final Test wicket was that of all-rounder Andrew Flintoff , stumped by Adam Gilchrist . [85]
Twenty20 career (2008–2013)[ edit ]
Warne bowling at Lord's for the Rajasthan Royals in a Twenty20 match against Middlesex in 2009
After his retirement from international cricket, Warne was signed as the captain for Rajasthan y the first Test of the 1954–55 tour of Australia . He took 1 for 131 as seven catches were dropped off his bowling, including Arthur Morris (153) before he had scored - and England lost by an innings. He was subsequently diagnosed as suffering from shingles and despite a recovery and a green wicket tailor-made for his bowling in the second Test he was dropped from the side, and watched as the younger Frank Tyson and Brian Statham bowled England to victory. He was recalled for one Test against South Africa in 1955.
In a Test career extending from 1946 to 1955, Bedser played 51 matches and took 236 wickets (average 24.89), at the time the most wickets taken in Test cricket. He was England's post-war bowling spearhead. He had 14 new ball partners, and took five wickets in an innings 15 times and ten wickets in a match 5 times. His entire first-class career spanned 485 matches, in which he helped Surrey to eight County Championships between 1950 and 1958. Bedser occasionally captained the side in place of Stuart Surridge or Peter May . He took 100 wickets in a county season eleven times, figures that place him high amongst the game's greats. He took five or more wickets in an innings 96 times, and ten wickets or more in a match 16 times. Bedser retired from cricket in 1960, and his brother Eric retired in 1962.
After retirement[ edit ]
After retiring from playing cricket, Bedser went into business with his brother. Among other business interests, they co-operated with Ronald Straker in a successful stationery firm, Straker-Bedser , which was later taken over by Ryman in 1977.
Bedser served as a national team selector from 1962 to 1985, and was chairman of selectors from 1968 to 1981. He was on the board of selectors who controversially left Basil d'Oliveira out of the England team for 1968's tour of South Africa. [9] England won ten of the 18 series while Bedser was chairman of selectors. [9] Bedser also managed two England overseas tours. Bedser was made president of Surrey in 1987 in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the county's cricketing fortunes over the previous five decades. He was knighted for his services to cricket in the 1997 New Year Honours . In October 2004 Bedser was selected in 'England's Greatest Post-War XI' by The Wisden Cricketer , an authoritative monthly cricket magazine. In May 2009, Christopher Martin-Jenkins ranked Bedser 29th in picking his 100 greatest cricketers of all time.[ citation needed ]
Outside of cricket, Bedser was a founding member of the right-wing pressure group , the Freedom Association during the 1970s, which advocated the maintenance of sporting relations with South Africa during the apartheid era. [10] [11] [12]
He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1964, advanced to Commander (CBE) in 1982, and in 1996 he became the first (and still only) England bowler to be knighted for services to cricket .
Neither Alec nor his brother Eric ever married. They lived together in Woking until Eric's death in 2006. Sir Alec Bedser died in hospital in Woking [13] on 4 April 2010 after a short illness. [14] Among those to pay tribute to the more famous of the two brothers was former Prime Minister, well-known cricket lover and lifelong Surrey supporter John Major , who said: "Alec Bedser was one of the greatest medium-fast bowlers of all time. He was also one of the great thinkers about cricket and his wisdom was one of the great untapped resources of the modern game." [15] For three months following the death of Arthur McIntyre on 26 December 2009, Bedser was the oldest surviving England Test cricketer. On Bedser's death, that distinction passed to Reg Simpson .



132/75
Source: [1] , 9 February 2006
Romesh Shantha Kaluwitharana (born November 24, 1969) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who played in 49 Test and 189 ODIs from 1990 to 2004. He was appointed as the interim cricket coach of Malaysia on the 17th of May 2008. He was a key member and wicket-keeper for 1996 Cricket World Cup winning team.
Early career[ edit ]
His early career made him look like a good Sri Lankan prospect, and the undoubted highlight of his career was the entertaining innings of 132 not out (including 26 boundaries) that he made on Test debut against a powerful Australian side in 1992. However, he failed to deliver on his promise in a declining Sri Lankan team (prior to the revival of Sri Lankan cricket at the 1996 World Cup ).
Aggressive Dual[ edit ]
Once in the national side, he sometimes threw his wicket away due to poor shot-selection and was suspect to the swinging delivery. However, he relished pace and would often be quick to put away any delivery off line or length. His greatest contribution to ODIs came after he was promoted to the top of the batting order to partner opener Sanath Jayasuriya during the 1995–96 tour of Australia, helping to give birth to an aggressive batting approach in the first fifteen overs of fielding restrictions . This new strategy of attacking from the outset heavily contributed to Sri Lanka to win all their matches and secure the 1996 Cricket World Cup as all other teams were not prepared for such an attack. Kaluwitharana was the wicket keeper and opener with Jayasuriya in that world cup series that was captained by Arjuna Ranatunga .
The two of them revolutionized the one day game and their tactics are now commonly used by limited overs openers. The two were commonly known as Little Dynamite and Master Blaster by commentators due to the fast attacking batting display where the fielding team has been devastated.
Kaluwitharana has spent a number of years contributing to charity work in the impoverished Northern part of Sri-Lanka along with his long-time cricket companion Muttiah Muralitharan .
Kalu was also admired by the critics due to unorthodox wicket-keeping display which given him lot of stumpings at that time.

History[ edit ]
The cover of the newspaper's first edition, on 18 April 1831
Three employees of the now-defunct Sydney Gazette , Ward Stephens , Frederick Stokes and William McGarvie , founded The Sydney Herald in 1831. The four-page weekly had a print run of 750. In 1840, the newspaper began to publish daily. In 1841, an Englishman named John Fairfax purchased the operation, renaming it The Sydney Morning Herald the following year. Fairfax, whose family were to control the newspaper for almost 150 years, based his editorial policies "upon principles of candour, honesty and honour.

During the decade 1890, Donald Murray worked there.
The SMH was late to the trend of printing news rather than just advertising on the front pagepital at Pathankot, now a district of Punjab, India. The kingdom included Pathankot and a large tract on the plains of the Punjab; also the whole of the present Nurpur Tahsil of Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, with the addition of Shahpurkandi, now in Pathankot, and also a small tract to the west of the Ravi, called Lakhanpur, now in Jammu & Kashmir State. The Kingdom was bounded on the north by Kangra and Chamba, on the south by the Punjab plains, and on the west by the Ravi river. The Capital was at Pathankot, which was known as Paithan in the medieval times. Throughout their history the Pathania clan rebelled against the foreign invaders. Though the Pathania kings sometimes held the high offices of generals known as Mansabdar in the Mughal military, and captured many a kingdom for the Mughal Emperor in Hindustan and beyond the Indus up till Uzbekistan. Yet, they repeatedly rebelled against the Mughal's and other foreign invaders. The most popular uprising was by Wazir Ram Singh Pathania who led a rebellion against the British Raj and was subsequently defeated by the British after a hard-fought battle. He was deported to Rangoon where he died in prison. Locals still sing ballads for their brave warrior, and a statue commemorating his deeds was erected on Pathankot Punjab-Dalhousie Himachal Highway.
Raja Jagat Singh Pathania (1618–1646) succeeded Suraj Mal (his elder brother) as the king of Dhameri (now Nurpur) in present-day Himachal, India. He was the second son of Raja Basu Dev . The golden period of Pathania rule on Nurpur (then Dhameri) came under the reign of Raja Jagat Singh. Raja Jagat Singh ruled until 1644 and during his reign rendered assistance to Mughal forces in Qandhar, Kabul.
After independence[ edit ]
After the independence of India, Pathankot, has developed as an important town in many aspects. The strategic point of location has prompted the establishment of the army and for the air force station for the defence of India. The Indian army and Indian air force has successful defended the territory of India in times of war. Traders supplying the army needs have also increased their business. After the partition of India, a huge amount of refugees came from newly formed Pakistan and settled in and around Pathankot. Most of them started trades of different kinds and many those businesses have grown into large business houses.

Indian Premier League[ edit ]
Albie played for the Chennai Super Kings since the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League where he had a very successful tournament as an all-rounder.
He is one of the regular names in the overseas four of the playing XI.

International career[ edit ]
Kamran Akmal is a quick-scoring batsman and a wicket-keeper, who has achieved 6 centuries in Test cricket. However, his first century was vital – his 109 from the number eight position at Mohali , coming in with Pakistan in a lead of 39 against India in the first Test, ensured that the visitors could draw the match. His form against the touring England in 2005 made him one of the most important players in the team. Naturally, he is a batsman that plays lower down the order but has sometimes opened in both Test and One-day cricket[ citation needed ]. As an opener he has scored two back to back centuries in ODIs against England. Coming in lower down the order in Test matches, he played one memorable innings. He saved Pakistan from a score of 39/6, scoring a century, to a competitive 245 which helped Pakistan win the match and the series.
His batting was highly productive in early 2006 as he scored seven international hundreds within the space of 6 months. Since his tour of England in Summer 2006 however his batting form dwindled and steadily become worse. His wicket-keeping also worsened and dropped many catches on both the England tour and on a tour to South Africa in early 2007. He then scored an international hundred in the Bangladeshi tour of Pakistan in 2008. He later moved to have some injuries and did not play for some days but later he was again brought into the team.
Akmal was dropped for the 2008 Asia Cup as a result of his poor wicket-keeping. He was replaced by Sarfraz Ahmed who performed very well at the domestic level and also because of Sarfraz's strong showing in the U-19 World Cup. Akmal was named in the 30 man probable squad for the 2008 ICC Champions Trophy .
Akmal was part of the Pakistan team that won the T20 World Cup in 2009 . He was notable for his quick stumpings, dismissing 4 batsmen in one match against Netherlands.
On 12 November 2008, Akmal hit two consecutive 6s in the last over. As a result Pakistan won the first ODI in Abu Dhabi against West Indies.
On 17 July 2010, Akmal was appointed the vice-captain of the Pakistani test squad but later removed because of his alleged involvement in spot fixing. [5]
In August 2012, Akmal was recalled for the three ODI series against Australia. [6]
Match fixing allegations[ edit ]
In the 2nd Test match in Sydney on the 2009–10 tour of Australia , Akmal dropped four catches in the Australian innings, three of those coming from Michael Hussey . Hussey went on to score 134 * and was involved in a massive 9th wicket partnership stand of 133 runs with Peter Siddle . Pakistan eventually went on to lose the match by 36 runs, after being dismissed for just 139 in the second innings. Later it was alleged that he, along with pace bowler Rana Naved-ul-Hasan were involved in match fixing , and were questioned by Pakistan Cricket Board and subsequently dropped for the Twenty20 series against England . [7]
In early September 2010, the International Cricket Council (ICC) sent an official notice to Kamran Akmal telling him that he is under investigation for allegedly fixing the Sydney Test. [3] For the subsequent series against South Africa in October 2010 Akmal had an operation to remove his appendix and was unavailable for the limited-overs squad. Akmal was able to recover from the operation to participate in the two-match test series but Zulqarnain Haider was selected ahead of him. [8] Another reason also emerged that Kamran Akmal, Shoaib Malik , Umar Amin and Yasir Hameed were not selected for the tour due to the fact that suspicions were raised that they were involved with the spot-fixing scandal that included Salman Butt , Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif . Another player Wahab Riaz was under investigation for match fixing but the ICC had interrogated him and he was no longer part of the investigation therefore he was allowed to take part on the tour of South Africa that included two Twenty20 Internationals, five ODI matches and two Test matches. Though this has not been confirmed by the board, it is believed that the reason they were not picked was that the suspicion had not been cleared. [9] The ICC confirmed that Akmal had been barred from entering the team. Once his investigation was completed he was available for national selection. [10]
Wicket-keeping[ edit ]
Kamran Akmal has been constantly criticized for his lack of consistent wicket-keeping. After another horrendous series behind the stumps against Sri Lanka in January 2009, journalists and former players called for his removal from the national team. [11] His wicket-keeping steadily improved, with a very strong showing in the 2009 T20 World Cup , including a world-record performance of four stumpings in a single match against the Netherlands. However during the second test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground he dropped four catches, including three chances from Michael Hussey in one session on Day 4. Hussey went on to score a match winning century with the Pakistan team losing in a shock result after dominating the first three days of play. [12] [13] He was subsequently dropped for the third test , being replaced by Sarfraz Ahmed . After this tour Akmal saw a steady improvement in his wicket-keeping for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 , 2010 Asia Cup and against Australia in July 2010 however the next test series against England saw Akmal drop three easy catches and miss a stumping. The match as a consolation saw Akmal take a superb catch of Kevin Pietersen before dropping a catch on the very next ball against Paul Collingwood . In the first innings Akmal dropped a catch of Eoin Morgan when he was on 23 who then went on to score 130. [14] Despite having another keeper, Zulqarnain Haider , in the squad, Pakistani captain Salman Butt announced it was too early in the series as only one match had been played to decide the fate of Kamran Akmal. [15]
Personal life[ edit ]
Kamran Akmal comes from a large family, of which two of his brothers, Adnan Akmal and Umar Akmal , are also professional cricketers, the former being a keeper-batsman and the latter being a specialist batsman as well as part-time wicket-keeper. He married in 2006 and lives with his wife, Aaiza, and their daughter, Laiba. [1] He is a graduate of Beaconhouse School System Garden Town, Lahore. [2]
IPL career[ edit ]
Akmal was signed on to the Rajasthan Royals , and played in the inaugural season of the IPL . He played five matches in the tournament, as wicket-keeper and top-order batsman, including the final of the tournament against the Chennai Super Kings . He took two catches in the first innings, however he was run out for six runs during the Royal's chase. The Royals went on to win the tournament after a thrilling finish. He did not play in 2009 because Pakistani players were not selected by any IPL teams to participate that season as a result of the tense atmosphere after the 2008 Mumbai attacks .



Overview[ edit ]
Physical therapy involves the interaction between therapist(s), patients or clients, other health care professionals, families, care givers, and communities in a process where movement potential is assessed and diagnosed and goals are agreed upon. [1] Physical therapy is performed by a physical therapist and sometimes services are provided by a physical therapist assistant (PTA) acting under their direction. Physical therapists and occupational therapists often work together in conjunction to provide treatment for patients. In some cases, physical rehabilitation technicians may provide physiotherapy services. [2]
PTs are Rehabilitation professionals who diagnose and treat individuals of all ages, from newborns to the very oldest, who have medical or surgical problems or other health-related conditions, illnesses, or injuries that limit their abilities to move and perform functional activities as well as they would like in their daily lives. [3] PTs use an individual's history and physical examination to arrive at a diagnosis and establish a management plan and, when necessary, incorporate the results of laboratory and imaging studies like X-rays, CT-scan, or MRI findings. Electrodiagnostic testing (e.g., electromyograms and nerve conduction velocity testing) may also be of assistance. [4] PT management commonly includes prescription of or assistance with specific exercises, manual therapy and manipulation, mechanical devices such as traction, education, physical agents which includes heat, cold, electricity, sound waves, radiation, rays, prescription of assistive devices, prostheses, orthoses and other interventions. In addition, PTs work with individuals to prevent the loss of mobility before it occurs by developing fitness and wellness-oriented programs for healthier and more active lifestyles, providing services to individuals and populations to develop, maintain and restore maximum movement and functional ability throughout the lifespan. This includes providing therapeutic treatment in circumstances where movement and function are threatened by aging, injury, disease or environmental factors. Functional movement is central to what it means to be healthy .
Physical therapy is a professional career which has many specialties including sports , neurology , wound care , EMG , cardiopulmonary , geriatrics , orthopaedic and pediatrics . Neurological rehabilitation is in particular a rapidly emerging field. PTs practice in many settings, such as private-owned physical therapy clinics, outpatient clinics or offices, health and wellness clinics, rehabilitation hospitals facilities, skilled nursing facilities, extended care facilities, private homes, education and research centers, schools , hospices , industrial and this workplaces or other occupational environments, fitness centers and sports training facilities. [5]
Physical therapists also practise in the non-patient care roles such as health policy, [6] [7] [8] [9] health insurance, health care administration and as health care executives. [10] [11] Physical therapists are involved in the medical-legal field serving as experts, performing peer review and independent medical examinations . [12]
Education qualifications vary greatly by country. The span of education ranges from some countries having little formal education to others having doctoral degrees and post doctoral residencies and fellowships. [13] [14]

(May 2012)
Exercise to shoulder and elbow to increase motion following fracture and dislocation of humerus is being given by an Army therapist to a soldier patient.
Physicians like Hippocrates and later Galen are believed to have been the first practitioners of physical therapy, advocating massage , manual therapy techniques and hydrotherapy to treat people in 460 BC. [15] [ verification needed ] After the development of orthopedics in the eighteenth century, machines like the Gymnasticon were developed to treat gout and similar diseases by systematic exercise of the joints, similar to later developments in physical therapy. [16] The earliest documented origins of actual physical therapy as a professional group date back to Per Henrik Ling , "Father of Swedish Gymnastics," who founded the Royal Central Institute of Gymnastics (RCIG) in 1813 for manipulation , and exercise . The Swedish word for physical therapist is sjukgymnast = someone involved in gymnastics for those who are ill. In 1887, PTs were given official registration by Sweden’s National Board of Health and Welfare. Other countries soon followed. In 1894, four nurses in Great Britain formed the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy . [17] The School of Physiotherapy at the University of Otago in New Zealand in 1913, [18] and the United States' 1914 Reed College in Portland, Oregon, which graduated "reconstruction aides." [19] Since the profession's inception, spinal manipulative therapy has been a component of the physical therapist practice. [20]
Modern physical therapy was established towards the end of the 19th century due to events that had an effect on a global scale, which called for rapid advances in physical therapy. Soon following American orthopedic surgeons began treating children with disabilities and began employing women trained in physical education, and remedial exercise. These treatments were applied and promoted further during the Polio outbreak of 1916. During the First World War women were recruited to work with and restore physical function to injured soldiers, and the field of physical therapy was institutionalized. In 1918 the term "Reconstruction Aide" was used to refer to individuals practicing physical therapy. The first school of physical therapy was established at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C., following the outbreak of World War I. [21] Research catalyzed the physical therapy movement. The first physical therapy research was published in the United States in March 1921 in "The PT Review." In the same year, Mary McMillan organized the Physical Therapy Association (now called the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA). In 1924, the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation promoted the field by touting physical therapy as a treatment for polio . [22] Treatment through the 1940s primarily consisted of exercise , massage, and traction . Manipulative procedures to the spine and extremity joints began to be practiced, especially in the British Commonwealth countries, in the early 1950s. [23] [24] Around this time when polio vaccines were developed, physical therapists have become a normal occurrence in hospitals throughout North America and Europe. [25] In the late 1950s, physical therapists started to move beyond hospital-based practice to outpatient orthopedic clinics, public schools, colleges/universities health-centres, geriatric settings (skilled nursing facilities), rehabilitation centers and medical centers. Specialization for physical therapy in the U.S. occurred in 1974, with the Orthopaedic Section of the APTA being formed for those physical therapists specily lives in Pretoria . Prior to marriage, he used to live with his brother Morné and team mate AB de Villiers in Pretoria .

Taxila in Pakistan is a World Heritage Site
The Punjab region of India and Pakistan has a historical and cultural link to Indo-Aryan peoples as well as partially to various indigenous communities. As a result of several invasions from Central Asia and the Middle East , many ethnic groups and religions make up the cultural heritage of the Punjab.
In prehistoric times, one of the earliest known cultures of South Asia , the Indus Valley Civilisation was located in the region.
The epic battles described in the Mahabharata are described as being fought in what is now the present-day State of Haryana and historic Punjab. The Gandharas , Kambojas , Trigartas, Andhra, Pauravas, Bahlikas (Bactrian settlers of the Punjab), Yaudheyas and others sided with the Kauravas in the great battle fought at Kurukshetra . [16] According to Dr Fauja Singh and Dr L. M. Joshi: "There is no doubt that the Kambojas, Daradas, Kaikayas, Andhra, Pauravas, Yaudheyas, Malavas, Saindhavas and Kurus had jointly contributed to the heroic tradition and composite culture of ancient Punjab". [17]
Menander I Soter (165/155 –130 BC) conqueror of the Punjab, he carved out a Greek kingdom in the Punjab and ruled the Punjab till his death in 130 B.C. [18] [19]
In 326 BCE, Alexander the Great invaded the tip of the Punjab from the north (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan) and defeated King Porus . His armies entered the region via the Hindu Kush in northwest Pakistan and his rule extended up to the city of Sagala (present-day Sialkot in northeast Pakistan). In 305 BCE the area was ruled by the Maurya Empire . In a long line of succeeding rulers of the area, Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka stand out as the most renowned. The Maurya presence in the area was then consolidated in the Indo-Greek Kingdom in 180 BCE. Menander I Soter "The Saviour" (known as Milinda in Indian sources) is the most renowned leader of the era, he conquered the Punjab and made Sagala the capital of his Empire . [18] Menander carved out a Greek kingdom in the Punjab and ruled the region till his death in 130 B.C. [19] The neighbouring Seleucid Empire rule came to an end around 12 BCE, after several invasions by the Yuezhi and the Scythian people.
In 711–713 CE, 18-year-old Arab Sultan Muhammad bin Qasim of Taif , a city in Saudi Arabia , came by way of the Arabian Sea with Arab troops to defeat Raja Dahir . The Sultan then led his troops to conquer the Sindh and Punjab regions for the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate . Qasim was the first to bring Islam to the region.
A section of the Lahore Fort built by the Mughal emperor Akbar .
During the establishment and consolidation of the Muslim Turkic Mughal Empire prosperity, growth, and relative peace were established. Particularly under the reign of Jahangir . Muslim empires ruled the Punjab for approximately 1000 years. The period was also notable for the emergence of Guru Nanak (1469–1539), the founder of Sikhism .
The Panjab 1880
In 1758, Punjab came under the rule of Marathas who captured the region by defeating Afghan forces of Ahmad Shah Abdali . Abdali's Indian invasion weakened the Maratha influence, but he could not defeat the Sikhs . After the death of Ahmad Shah, the Punjab was freed from the Afghan yoke by Sikhs between 1773 and 1818. At the time of the formation of the Dal Khalsa in 1748 at Amritsar , the Punjab had been divided into 36 areas and 12 separate Sikh principalities, called misl . From this point onward, the beginnings of a Punjabi Sikh Empire emerged. Out of the 36 areas, 22 were united by Maharaja Ranjit Singh . The other 14 accepted British sovereignty . After Ranjit Singh's death, assassinations and internal divisions severely weakened the empire. Six years later the British East India Company was given an excuse to declare war and in 1849, after two Anglo-Sikh wars , the Punjab was annexed by the British.
Punjab Province (British India) , 1909
In the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the Sikh rulers backed the East India Company, providing troops and support, [20] but in Jhelum 35 British soldiers of HM XXIV regiment were killed by the local resistance and in Ludhiana a rebellion was crushed with the assistance of the Punjab chiefs of Nabha and Malerkotla .
The British Raj had political, cultural, philosophical and literary consequences in the Punjab, including the establishment of a new system of education. During the independence movement, many Punjabis played a significant role, including Madan Lal Dhingra , Sukhdev Thapar , Ajit Singh Sandhu , Bhagat Singh , Udham Singh , Kartar Singh Sarabha , Bhai Parmanand , Muhammad Iqbal , Chaudhary Rehmat Ali , and Lala Lajpat Rai .
At the time of partition in 1947, the province was split into East and West Punjab. East Punjab (about 35%) became part of India, while West Punjab (65%) became part of Pakistan. [21] The Punjab bore the brunt of the civil unrest following the British Raj, with casualties estimated to be in millions.
Physical geography[ edit ]
At the time of the Sikh Empire Punjab covered a large territory – the entire Indus basin and the watershed between the Indus and Gangetic plains. It could be divided into four natural areas: [2]
the eastern mountainous region including Jammu Division ;
the central plain with its five rivers;
the north-western region, separated from the central plain by the Salt Range between the Jhelum and the Indus rivers;
the semi-desert to the south of the Sutlej river.
The formation of the Himalayan Range of mountains to the east and north-east of the Punjab is the result of a collision between the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate . The plates are still moving together, and the Himalayas are rising by about 5mm per year.
The upper regions are snow-covered the whole year. Lower ranges of hills run parallel to the mountains. The Lower Himalayan Range runs from north of Rawalpindi though Jammu and Kashmir , Himachal Pradesh and further south. The mountains are relatively young, and are eroding rapidly. The Indus and the five rivers of the Punjab have their sources in the mountain range and carry loam, minerals and silt down to the rich alluvial plains, which consequently are very fertile. [22]
Climate[ edit ]
The snow-covered Himalayas
The climate is a factor contributing to the economy of the Punjab. It is not uniform over the whole region, the sections adjacent to the Himalayas receiving heavier rainfall than those at a distance. [23]
There are three main seasons and two transitional periods. During the Hot Season, from about mid April to the end of June, the temperature may reach 49˚C. The Monsoon Season, from July to September, is a period of heavy rainfall, providing water for crops in addition to the supply from canals and irrigation systems. The transitional period after the monsoon is cool and m, doing so from 15 April 1944. Of the country's metropolitan dailies, only The West Australian was later in making the switch. In 1949, the newspaper launched a Sunday edition, The Sunday Herald. Four years later, this was merged with the newly acquired Sun newspaper to create The Sun-Herald, which continues to this day.
In 1995, the company launched smh.com.au , the newspaper's web edition. The site has since grown to include interactive and multimedia features beyond the content in the print edition. Around the same time, the organisation moved from Jones Street to new offices at Darling Park and built a new printing press at Chullora , in the city's west. The SMH has since moved with other Sydney Fairfax divisions to a building at Darling Island.
In May 2007, Fairfax Media announced it would be moving from a broadsheet format to the smaller compact or tabloid-size , in the footsteps of The Times , for both The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. [9] Fairfax Media dumped these plans later in the year. However, in June 2012, Fairfax Media again announced it planned to shift both broadsheet newspapers to tabloid size, in March 2013. [10] Fairfax also announced it would cut staff across the entire group by 1,900 over three years and erect paywalls around the papers' websites. [11] The subscription type is to be a freemium model, limiting readers to a number of free stories per month, with a payment required for further access. [12] The announcement was part of an overall "digital first" strategy of increasingly digital or on-line content over printed delivery, to "increase sharing of editorial content", and to assist the managements wish for "full integration of its online, print and mobile platforms". [11]
In July 2013 it was announced that the SMH's news director, Jack Brennan, will become Editor-in-Chief, replacing Sean Aylmer. [13]
On 22 February 2014, the final Saturday edition was produced in broadsheet format with this too converted to compact format on 1 March 2014. [14] ahead of the decommissioning of the printing plant at Chullora in June 2014. [15]
Political viewpoint[ edit ]
Historically, the SMH had been a conservative newspaper. It did not endorse the Australian Labor Party at any election until 1984 or at a state election until 2003.
During the 2004 Australian federal election the Herald announced it would "no longer endorse one party or another at election time". The newspaper said the policy might yet be revised: "A truly awful government of any colour, for example, would bring reappraisal." [16] The Herald subsequently endorsed the conservative Coalition at the 2007 NSW State election , [17] but endorsed Labor at the 2007 and 2010 Federal elections , [18] before endorsing the Coalition again at the 2013 Federal elections : "The Herald believes only the Coalition can achieve [a stable government that can be trusted to deliver what it promises]". [19]
The newspaper has in recent years attempted to spearhead political campaigns, including the "Campaign for Sydney" (planning and transport) and " Earth Hour " (environment).[ citation needed ]

Additionally, commentators or spectators discussing the details of field placement will often use the terms for descriptive phrases such as "gully is a bit wider than normal" (meaning he is more to the side than normal) or "mid off is standing too deep, he should come in shorter" (meaning he is too far away and should be positioned closer to the batsman).
Restrictions on field placement[ edit ]
Main article: Fielding restrictions (cricket)
Fielders may be placed anywhere on the field, subject to the following rules. At the time the ball is bowled:
No fielder may be standing on or with any part of his body over the pitch (the central strip of the playing area between the wickets). If his body casts a shadow over the pitch the shadow must not move until after the batsman has played (or had the opportunity to play) at the ball.
There may be no more than two fielders, other than the wicket-keeper, standing in the quadrant of the field behind square leg. See Bodyline for details on one reason this rule exists.
In some one-day matches :
During designated overs of an innings (see Powerplay ), there may be no more than two fielders standing outside an oval line marked on the field, being semicircles centred on the middle stump of each wicket of radius 30 yards, joined by straight lines parallel to the pitch. This is known as the fielding circle . In addition, during these overs there must be two fielders (other than the wicket-keeper) in designated "close catching" positions.
For the remainder of the innings there may be no more than four fielders standing outside the fielding circle.
The restriction for one-day cricket is designed to prevent the fielding team from setting extremely defensive fields and concentrating solely on preventing the batting team from scoring runs.
If any of these rules is violated, an umpire will call the delivery a no ball . Additionally a player may not make any significant movement after the ball comes into play and before the ball reaches the striker. If this happens, an umpire will call and signal 'dead ball'. For close fielders anything other than minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to the striker is significant. In the outfield, fielders may move in towards the striker or striker's wicket; indeed, they usually do. However, anything other than slight movement off line or away from the striker is to be considered significant.
Tactics of field placement[ edit ]
With only nine fielders (apart from the bowler and wicket-keeper), the captain of the fielding team must decide which fielding positions to cover, and which to leave vacant. The placement of fielders is one of the major tactical considerations for the fielding captain.
Attacking and defending[ edit ]
Marcus Trescothick misfields at slip during a Twenty20 match.
The main decision for a fielding captain is to strike a balance between setting an attacking field and a defensive field. An attacking field is one in which fielders are positioned in such a way that they are likely to take catches, and thus likely to get the batsman out. Such a field generally involves having many fielders close to the batsman, especially in either slip short leg positions.
A defensive field is one in which most of the field is covered by a fielder; the batsman will therefore find it hard to score large numbers of runs. This generally involves having many fielders far from the batsman and in front of him, in the positions where he is most likely to hit the ball.
Many elements govern the decisions on field placements, including: the tactical situation in the match; which bowler is bowling ; how long the batsman has been in; the wear on the ball; the state of the wicket; the light; or even how close you are to an interval in play.
Some general principles:
Attack…
… new batsmen 
A batsman early in his innings is more likely to make a miscalculated or rash shot, so it pays to have catching fielders ready.
… with the new ball 
fast bowlers get the most swing and bounce with a newer ball, factors that make it harder to bat without making an error.
… when returning from a break in play 
Batsmen must settle into a batting rhythm again when resuming play for a new session or after drinks, bad weather, or injury interrupt a session. While doing so, they are more likely to make mistakes.
… with quality bowlers 
A team's best bowlers tend to deliver the most difficult balls to hit, so they get the most benefit from the support of an attacking field.
… when the pitch helps the bowler 
A moist pitch helps fast bowlers get unpredictable seam-movement of the ball, while a dry, crumbling pitch helps spin bowlers get unpredictable spin and damp, overcast conditions help swing bowlers. All three situations can lead to catches flying to close attacking fielders.
… when the batting team is under pressure 
If the batting team is doing poorly or has low morale, increase the pressure by attacking with the field.
… when the batting side are playing for a draw 
when a team is a long way behind in a first-class game and there is not much time left to play, it becomes more important to bowl out the side and finish the game than to control runs.

Defend…
… when batsmen are settled in 
It is difficult to get batsmen out when they have been batting for a long time and are comfortable with the bowling. The best tactic is often to defend and force the run scoring rate to slow down, which can frustrate the batsman into playing a rash shot.
… when the batting team needs to score runs quickly 
In situations where the batting team must score quickly in order to win or press an advantage (e.g. the " death overs " at the end of a limited-over innings), slowing down the scoring becomes more important than trying to dismiss the batsmen.
… when the batting team is scoring quickly 
If the batsmen are managing to score runs quickly, it is unlikely they are offering many chances to get them out, so reduce the run scoring rate.
… when the ball and pitch offer no help to the bowlers 
If there is no movement of the ball and the batsmen can hit it comfortably every time, there is little point in having lots of close catching fielders.
… when using weak bowlers 
If a relatively poor bowler must bowl for any reason, the best tactic is often to limit the potential damage by containing the free scoring of runs.
Off- and leg-side fields[ edit ]
Another consideration when setting a field is how many fielders to have on each side of the pitch. With nine fielders to place, the division must necessarily be unequal, but the degree of inequality varies.
When describing a field setting, the numbers of fielders on the off side and leg side are often abbreviated into a shortened form, with the off side number quoted first. For example, a 5–4 field means 5 fielders on the off side and 4 on the leg side.
Usually, most fielders are placed on the off side. This is because most bowlers tend to concentrate the line of their deliveries on or outside the off stump , so most shots are hit into the off side.
When attacking, there may be 3 or 4 slips and 1 or 2 gullies, potentially using up to six fielders in that region alone. This would typically be accompanied by a mid off, mid on, and fine leg, making it a 7–2 field. Although there are only two fielders on the leg side, they should get relatively little work as long as the bowlers maintain a line outside off stump. This type of field leaves large gaps in front of the wicket, and is used to entice the batsmen to attack there, with the hope that they make a misjudgment and edge the ball to the catchers waiting behind them.
As fields get progressively more defensive, fielders will move out of the slip and gully area to cover more of the field, leading to 6–3 and 5–4 fields.
If a bowler, usually a leg spin bowler, decides to attack the batsman's legs in an attempt to force a stumping , bowl him behind his legs, or induce a catch on the leg side, the field may stack 4–5 towards the leg side. It is unusual to see more than 5 fielders on the leg side, because of the restriction that there must be no more than two fielders placed behind square leg.
Main article: Leg theory
Sometimes a spinner will bowl leg theory and have seven fielders on the leg side, and will bowl significantly wide of the leg stump to prevent scoring. Often the ball is so wide that the batsman cannot hit the ball straight of mid-on while standing still, and cannot hit to the off side unless they try unorthodox and risky shots such as a reverse sweep or pull, or switch their handedness. The batsman can back away to the leg side to hit through the off side, but can expose their stumps in doing so.
Main article: Off theory
The reverse tactic can be used, by fast and slow bowlers alike, by placing seven or eight fielders on the off side and bowling far outside off stump. The batsman can safely allow the ball to pass without fear of it hitting the stumps, but will not score. If they want to score they will have to try and risk an edge to a wide ball and hit through the packed off side, or trying and drag the ball from far outside the stumps to the sparsely-populated leg side.
Another attacking placement on the leg side is the leg side trap, which involves placing fielders near the boundary at deep square and backward square leg and bowling bouncers to try to induce the batsman to hook the ball into the air. For slower bowlers, the leg trap fieldsmen tend to be placed within 10–15 m from the bat behind square, to catch leg glances and sweeps.

A silly point (far) and a short leg (near) fielding for Nottinghamshire. Both are wearing helmets. The wicket-keeper's shin pads are on the outside of his trousers, but the fielders must fit their guards underneath their clothing.
No member of the fielding side other than the wicket-keeper may wear gloves or external leg guards, though fielders (in particular players fielding near to the bat) may also wear shin protectors, groin protectors ('boxes') and chest protectors beneath their clothing. Apart from the wicket-keeper, protection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires.
Fielders are permitted to wear a helmet and face guard. This is usually employed in a position such as silly point or silly mid-wicket, where proximity to the batsman gives little time to avoid a shot directly at their head. Due to the discomfort and risk of being hit, the duty of fielding "under the helmet" or "under the lid" is often delegated to the most junior member of the team. If the helmet is only being used for overs from one end, it will be placed behind the wicketkeeper when not in use. Some grounds have purpose-built temporary storage in the form of a cavity beneath the pitch, approximately 1m x 1m x 1m in size, accessed through a hatch flush with the grass, which can be used for storing a helmet, shin pads or drinks for the fielding side. 5 penalty runs are awarded to the batting side should the ball touch a fielder's headgear whilst it is not being worn unless the ball previously struck a batsman not attempting to hit or avoid the ball. This rule was introduced in the 19th century to prevent the unfair practice of a fielder using a hat (often a top hat ) to take a catch.
As cricket balls are hard and can travel at high speeds off the bat, protective equipment is recommended to prevent injury. There have been a few recorded deaths in cricket, [3] but they are extremely rare, and not always related to fielding.ain the king of the Rakshasas, viz Ravana, with his brother Kumbhakarna, and sons and kindred, Rama installed in the kingdom of Lanka the Rakshasa chief, Vibhishana, pious, and reverent, and kind to devoted dependents. The battle in Lanka is depicted in a famous bas-relief in the 12th century Khmer temple of Angkor Wat.
Portuguese Era[ edit ]
Portuguese explorers led by Dom Lourenço de Almeida first arrived in Sri Lanka in 1505. During their initial visit they made a treaty with the King of Kotte , Parakramabahu VIII (1484–1508), which enabled them to trade in the island's crop of cinnamon, which lay along the coastal areas of the island, including in Colombo. [17] As part of the treaty, the Portuguese were given full authority over the coastline in exchange for the promise of guarding the coast against invaders. They were allowed to establish a trading post in Colombo. [17] Within a short time, however, they expelled the Muslim inhabitants of Colombo and began to build a fort in 1517.
The Portuguese soon realized that control of Sri Lanka was necessary for protection of their coastal establishments in India and they began to manipulate the rulers of the Kotte kingdom to gain control of the area. After skilfully exploiting rivalries within the royal family, they took control of a large area of the kingdom and the Sinhalese King Mayadunne established a new kingdom at Sitawaka, a domain in the Kotte kingdom. [17] Before long he annexed much of the Kotte kingdom and forced the Portuguese to retreat to Colombo, which was repeatedly besieged by Mayadunne and the later kings of Sitawaka, forcing them to seek reinforcement from their major base in Goa , India. Following the fall of the kingdom in 1593, the Portuguese were able to establish complete control over the coastal area, with Colombo as their capital. [17] [18] This part of Colombo is still known as Fort and houses the presidential palace and the majority of Colombo's five star hotels. The area immediately outside Fort is known as Pettah (Sinhala පිට කොටුව piṭa koṭuva, "outer fort") and is a commercial hub.
Dutch Era[ edit ]
Dutch engraving of Colombo in about 1680
In 1638 the Dutch signed a treaty with King Rajasinha II of Kandy which assured the king assistance in his war against the Portuguese in exchange for a monopoly of the island's major trade goods. The Portuguese resisted the Dutch and the Kandyans but were gradually defeated in their strongholds beginning in 1639. [19] The Dutch captured Colombo in 1656 after an epic siege, at the end of which a mere 93 Portuguese survivors were given safe conduct out of the fort. Although the Dutch (e.g., Rijcklof van Goens ) initially restored the captured area back to the Sinhalese kings, they later refused to turn them over and gained control over the island's richest cinnamon lands including Colombo which then served as the capital of the Dutch maritime provinces under the control of the Dutch East India Company until 1796. [19] [20]
British era[ edit ]

Although the British captured Colombo in 1796, it remained a British military outpost until the Kandyan Kingdom was ceded to them in 1815 and they made Colombo the capital of their newly created crown colony of British Ceylon . Unlike the Portuguese and Dutch before them, whose primary use of Colombo was as a military fort, the British began constructing houses and other civilian structures around the fort, giving rise to the current City of Colombo. [10]
Initially, they placed the administration of the city under a "Collector", and John Macdowell of the Madras Service was the first to hold the office. Then, in 1833, the Government Agent of the Western Province was charged with the administration of the city. Centuries of colonial rule had meant a decline of indigenous administration of Colombo, and in 1865 the British conceived a Municipal Council as a means of training the local population in self-governance . The Legislative Council of Ceylon constituted the Colombo Municipal Council in 1865 and the Council met for the first time on the January 16, 1866. At the time, the population of the region was around 80,000. [10]
During the time they were in control of the Colombo, the British were responsible for much of the planning of the present city. In some parts of the city tram car tracks and granite flooring laid during the era are still visible today. [20] [21]
After independence[ edit ]
The formal ceremony marking the start of self-rule at Independence Square .
This era of colonialism ended peacefully in 1948 when Ceylon gained independence from Britain. [22] Due to the tremendous impact this caused on the city's inhabitants and on the country as a whole, the changes that resulted at the end of the colonial period were drastic. An entire new culture took root. Changes in laws and customs, clothing styles, religions and proper names were a significant result of the colonial era. [22] These cultural changes were followed by the strengthening of the island's economy. Even today, the influence of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British is clearly visible in Colombo's architecture, names, clothing, food, language and attitudes. Buildings from all three eras stand as reminders of the turbulent past of Colombo. The city and its people show an interesting mix of European clothing and lifestyles together with local customs. [22]
Historically, Colombo referred to the area around the Fort and Pettah Market which is famous for the variety of products available as well as the Khan Clock Tower , a local landmark. At present, it refers to the city limits of the Colombo Municipal Council . [23] More often, the name is used for the Conurbation known as Greater Colombo , which encompasses several Municipal councils including Kotte , Dehiwela and Colombo.
Although Colombo lost its status as the capital of Sri Lanka in the 1980s, it continues to be the island's commercial centre. Despite the official capital of Sri Lanka moving to the adjacent Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte, most countries still maintain their diplomatic missions in Colombo. [24]
The Beira Lake at night
Colombo's geography is a mix of land and water. The city has many canals and, in the heart of the city, the 65-hectare (160-acre) Beira Lake . [25] The lake is one of the most distinctive landmarks of Colombo, and was used for centuries by colonists to defend the city. [25] It remains a popular attraction, hosting regattas , [26] and theatrical events on its shores. The Northern and North-Eastern border of the city of Colombo is formed by the Kelani River , which meets the sea in a part of the city known as the Modera (mōdara in Sinhala) which means river delta .
Climate[ edit ]
Colombo features a tropical monsoon climate under the Köppen climate classification , falling just short of a tropical rainforest climate . Colombo's climate is fairly temperate all throughout the year. From March to April the temperature averages around 31 degrees Celsius (88 degrees Fahrenheit) maximum. [27] The only major change in the Colombo weather occurs during the monsoon seasons from May to August and October to January. This is the time of year where heavy rains can be expected. Colombo sees little relative diurnal range of temperature, although this is more marked in the drier winter months, where minimum temperatures average 22 degrees Celsius (72 degrees Fahrenheit). Rainfall in the city averages around 2,400 millimetres (94 in) a year. [28]

1879 Australian rules football match played under electric lights
Crowd during a VFL football match, early 1900s
Despite being called the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the stadium has been and continues to be used much more often for Australian rules football . Spectator numbers for football are larger than for any other sport in Australia, and it makes more money for the MCG than any of the other sports played there.
Although the Melbourne Cricket Club members were instrumental in founding Australian Rules Football, there were understandable concerns in the early days about the damage that might be done to the playing surface if football was allowed to be played at the MCG. Therefore, football games were often played in the parklands next to the cricket ground, and this was the case for the first documented football match to be played at the ground. The match which today is considered to be the first Australian rules football, played between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar over three Saturdays beginning 7 August 1858 was played in this area.
It wasn’t until 1869 that football was played on the MCG proper, a trial game involving a police team. It was not for another ten years, in 1879, after the formation of the Victorian Football Association, that the first official match was played on the MCG and the cricket ground itself became a regular venue for football. Two night matches were played on the ground during the year under the newly invented electric light . [20] [21]
In the early years, the MCG was the home ground of Melbourne Football Club , Australia’s oldest club, established in 1858 by the founder of the game itself, Thomas Wills. Melbourne won five premierships during the 1870s using the MCG as its home ground.
The first of nearly 2500 Victorian Football League/Australian Football League games to be played at the MCG was on 15 May 1897, with Melbourne beating Geelong 64 to 19.
Several Australian Football League (AFL) clubs later joined Melbourne in using the MCG as their home ground for matches: Richmond (1965), North Melbourne (1985), Essendon (1992), Collingwood (started moving in 1994, became full-time tenant in 2000) and Hawthorn (2000). Melbourne used the venue as its training base until 1984, before being required to move to preserve the venue's surface when North Melbourne began playing there. [22]
Finals and Grand Finals[ edit ]
A sold out MCG during the 2007 AFL Grand Final
The VFL/AFL Grand Final has been played at the MCG every season since 1902, except in 1924 , when no Grand Final was held because of the season's round-robin finals format (it hosted three of the six games in the Finals Series), 1942–1945, when the ground was used by the military during World War II; and in 1991 , as the construction of the Great Southern Stand had temporarily reduced the ground’s capacity below that of Waverley Park . All three Grand Final Replays have been played at the MCG.
Before the ground was fully seated, the Grand Final could draw attendances above 110,000. The record for the highest attendance in the history of the sport was set in the 1970 VFL Grand Final , with 121,696 in attendance.
Since being fully seated, Grand Final attendances are typically between 95,000 and 100,000, with the record of 100,016 attending the first 2010 AFL Grand Final (which ended in a draw, requiring a replay).
In the modern era, most finals games held in Melbourne have been played at the MCG. Under the current contract, ten finals (excluding the Grand Final) must be played at the MCG over a five-year period. Under previous contracts, the MCG was entitled to host at least one match in each week of the finals, which on two occasions required a non-Victorian club to play a "home" final in Victoria.
The MCG and the VFL/AFL[ edit ]
For many years the VFL had an uneasy relationship with the MCG trustees and the Melbourne Cricket Club . Both needed the other, but resented the dependence. The VFL made the first move which brought things to a head by beginning the development of VFL Park at Mulgrave in the 1960s as its own home ground and as a potential venue for future grand finals. Then in 1983, president of the VFL, Alan Aylett started to pressure the MCG Trust to give the VFL a greater share of the money it made from using the ground for football.
In March 1983 the MCG trustees met to consider a submission from Aylett. Aylett said he wanted the Melbourne Cricket Club’s share of revenue cut from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. He threatened to take the following day’s opening game of the season, Collingwood vs Melbourne, away from the MCG. The money was held aside until an agreement could be reached.
Different deals, half deals and possible deals were done over the years, with the Premier of Victoria , John Cain, Jr. , even becoming involved. Cain was said to have promised the VFL it could use the MCG for six months of the year and then hand it back to the MCC, but this never eventuated, as the MCG Trust did not approve it. In the mid-1980s, a deal was done where the VFL was given its own members area in the Southern Stand.
Against this background of political manoeuvring, in 1985 North Melbourne became the third club to make the MCG its home ground. In the same year, North played in the first night football match at the MCG for almost 110 years, against Collingwood on 29 March 1985.
In 1986, only a month after Ross Oakley had taken over as VFL Commissioner, VFL executives met with the MCC and took a big step towards resolving their differences. Changes in the personnel at the MCC also helped. In 1983 John Lill was appointed secretary and Don Cordner its president.
Shortly after the Southern Stand opened in 1992, the Australian Football League moved its headquarters into the complex. The AFL assisted with financing the new stand and came to an agreement that ensures at least 45 AFL games are played at the MCG each year, including the Grand Final in September. Another 45 days of cricket are also played there each year and more than 3.5 million spectators come to watch every year.
As of the end of 2011, Matthew Richardson holds the records for having scored the most goals on the MCG, and Kevin Bartlett holds the record for playing the most matches at the MCG. Two players have scored 14 goals for an AFL or VFL game in one match at the MCG: Gary Ablett, Sr. in 1989 and 1993, and John Longmire in 1990.
Before an AFL match between Richmond and Carlton on 27 August 1999, the city end scoreboard caught on fire due to an electrical fault, causing the start of play to be delayed by half an hour.

World War II[ edit ]
During World War II, the government requisitioned the MCG for military use. From 1942 until 1945 it was occupied by (in order): the US Army Air Forces, the Royal Australian Air Force, the US Marine Corps and again the RAAF. [23] Over the course of the war, more than 200,000 personnel were barracked at the MCG. From April to October 1942, the US Army’s Fifth Air Force occupied the ground, naming it "Camp Murphy", in honor of officer Colonel William Murphy, a senior USAAF officer killed in Java . In 1943 the MCG was home to the legendary First Regiment of the First Division of the United States Marine Corp. The First Marine Corp were the heroes of the battle of Guadalcanal (and later Okinawa) used the "cricket grounds", as the marines referred to it, to rest and recuperate. [23] On 14 March 1943 the marines hosted a giant "get together" of US and Australian troops on the arena. [23]
In 1977, Melbourne Cricket Club president Sir Albert Chadwick and Congressional Medal of Honour winner Colonel Mitchell Page unveiled a commemorative plaque recognizing the Americans' time at the ground. [23]
In the 2010 TV miniseries, The Pacific , episode 3, members of the US Marines are shown to be camped in the war-era MCG.
Main article: 1956 Summer Olympics
The MCG’s most famous moment in history was as the main stadium for the 1956 Olympic Games. [24] The MCG was only one of seven possible venues, including the Melbourne Showgrounds, for the Games’ main arena. The MCG was the Federal Government’s preferred venue but there was resistance from the MCC. The inability to decide on the central venue nearly caused the Games to be moved from Melbourne. Prime Minister Robert Menzies recognised the potential embarrassment to Australia if this happened and organised a three-day summit meeting to thrash things out. Attending was Victorian Premier John Cain, Sr. , the Prime Minister, deputy opposition leader Arthur Calwell , all State political leaders, civic ledrew Strauss and coach Andy Flower met with the Indian captain Dhoni and their coach Duncan Fletcher and they agreed to withdraw the appeal. [20] Bell was eventually dismissed for 159. England continued to bat strongly with tail-ender Tim Bresnan getting 90 runs. England were eventually bowled out for 544 runs, setting India a target of 478 runs to win. India's response to this target was poor and they slumped to 68/6 at tea on day 4. England dismissed India's top second innings scorer, Sachin Tendulkar for 56 soon after tea. England wrapped the game up in the evening session, finally dismissing India for 158 runs, winning by 319 runs.



Narendra Modi meets Vladimir Putin at the 6th BRICS summit . India and Russia share extensive economic, defence, and technological ties .
Since its independence in 1947, India has maintained cordial relations with most nations. In the 1950s, it strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a lead role in the Non-Aligned Movement . [192] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of neighbouring countries: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'état attempt in Maldives. India has tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times : in 1947 , 1965 , 1971 , and 1999 . Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir , while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh . [193] After waging the 1962 Sino-Indian War and the 1965 war with Pakistan, India pursued close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union ; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier. [194]
Aside from ongoing strategic relations with Russia , India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France . In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organisation . The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit , the G8+5 , and other multilateral forums. [195] India has close economic ties with South America , [196] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a "Look East" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan , and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security. [197] [198]

China's nuclear test of 1964 , as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons. [199] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out further underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , considering both to be flawed and discriminatory. [200] India maintains a " no first use " nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its " minimum credible deterrence " doctrine. [201] [202] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, in collaboration with Russia, a fifth-generation fighter jet . [203] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines . [203]
Since the end of the Cold War , India has increased its economic, strategic, and military cooperation with the United States and the European Union . [204] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group , ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. [205] India subsequently signed cooperation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, [206] France, [207] the United Kingdom , [208] and Canada . [209]
The President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces; with 1.325 million active troops, they compose the world's third-largest military . [210] It comprises the Indian Army , the Indian Navy , and the Indian Air Force ; auxiliary organisations include the Strategic Forces Command and three paramilitary groups : the Assam Rifles , the Special Frontier Force , and the Indian Coast Guard . [211] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP. [212] For the fiscal year spanning 2012–2013, US$40.44 billion was budgeted. [213] According to a 2008 SIPRI report, India's annual military expenditure in terms of purchasing power stood at US$72.7 billion. [214] In 2011, the annual defence budget increased by 11.6%, [215] although this does not include funds that reach the military through other branches of government. [216] As of 2012, India is the world's largest arms importer; between 2007 and 2011, it accounted for 10% of funds spent on international arms purchases. [217] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean . [215]

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as of October 2015, the Indian economy is nominally worth US$2.182 trillion; it is the 7th-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is, at US$8.027 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity , or PPP. [14] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–12, [218] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies . [219] However, the country ranks 140th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 129th in GDP per capita at PPP . [220] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy ; [221] since then it has slowly moved towards a free-market system [222] [223] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows. [224] India's recent economic model is largely capitalist. [223] India has been a member of WTO since 1 January 1995. [225]
The 486.6-million worker Indian labour force is the world's second-largest , as of 2011. [211] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes. [190] Major industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software. [190] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985. [222] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.68%; [226] In 2011, India was the world's tenth-largest importer and the nineteenth-largest exporter . [227] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and leather manufactures. [190] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals. [190] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%. [228] India was the second largest textile exporter after China in the world in calendar year 2013. [229]
Averaging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007, [222] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century. [230] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580 million by 2030. [231] Though ranking 51st in global competitiveness , India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies, as of 2010. [232] With 7 of the world's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States, as of 2009. [233] India's consumer market, the world's eleventh-largest , is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030. [231]
Driven by growth, India's nominal GDP per capita has steadily increased from US$329 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,265 in 2010, and is estimated to increase to US$2,110 by 2016; however, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future. However, it is higher than Pakistan, Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and others. [234]
According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, India's GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045. [235] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050. [235] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. [235] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure , agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education , energy security , and public health and nutrition. [236]
Sectors
India's telecommunication industry , the world's fastest-growing, added 227 million subscribers during the period 2010–11, [237] and after the first quarter of 2013, India surpassed Japan to become the third largest smartphone market in the world after China and the U.S. [238]

Its automotive industry , the world's second fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–10, [239] and exports by 36% during 2008–09. [240] India's capacity to generate electrical power is 250 gigawatts, of which 8% is renewable . At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8 million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100 billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP and contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports. [241]
The pharmaceutical industry in India is among the significant emerging markets for global pharma industry. The Indian pharmaceutical market is expected to reach $48.5 billion by 2020. India's R & D spending constitutes 60% of the biopharmaceutical industry. [242] [243] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations of the world. [244] [245] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–13, increasing its revenues from 204.4 Billion INR (Indian Rupees) to 235.24 Billion INR (3.94 B US$ - exchange rate June 2013: 1 US$ approx. 60 INR). [246] Although hardly 2% of Indians pay income taxes . [247]
Poverty
Despite impressive economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. India contains the largest concentration of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day, [248] the proportion having decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005, and 25% in 2011. [249] 30.7% of India's children under the age of five are underweight. [250] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of Indian population is undernourished. [251] [252] The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates. [253] Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest. [254] Corruption in India is perceived to have increased significantly, [255] with one report estimating the illegal capital flows since independence to be US$462 billion. [256] India has the highest number of people living in conditions of slavery , 14 million, most of whom are in bonded labour . [257] India has the largest number of child labourers under the age of 14 in the world with an estimated 12.6 million children engaged in hazardous occupations. [258] [259] [260]

With 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report, [13] India is the world's second-most populous country. Its population grew by 17.64% during 2001–2011, [261] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001). [261] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males. [13] The median age was 24.9 in the 2001 census. [211] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361.1 million people. [262] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the " Green Revolution " have caused India's population to grow rapidly. [263] India continues to face several public health-related challenges. [264] [265]
Life expectancy in India is at 68 years with life expectancy for women being 69.6 years and for men being 67.3. [266] There are around 50 physicians per 100,000 Indians. [267] The number of Indians living in urban areas has grown by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001. [268] Yet, in 2001, over 70% lived in rural areas. [269] [270] The level of urbanization increased from 27.81% in 2001 Census to 31.16% in 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall growth rate of population was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991. [271] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus cities in India ; among them Mumbai , Delhi , Bangalore , Hyderabad , Chennai , Ahmedabad , Pune and Kolkata are in order of the most populous metropolitan areas . The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males. [272] The rural urban literacy gap which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in literacy rate in rural area is two times that in urban areas. [271] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%. [272]
India is home to two major language families : Indo-Aryan (spoken by about 74% of the population) and Dravidian (24%). Other languages spoken in India come from the Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan language families. India has no national language. [273] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government. [274] [275] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a "subsidiary official language"; [4] it is important in education , especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 "scheduled languages". The Constitution of India recognises 212 scheduled tribal groups which together constitute about 7.5% of the country's population. [276] The 2011 census reported [277] that Hinduism (79.8% of the population) is the largest religion in India , followed by Islam (14.23%). Other religions or none (5.97% of the population) include Christianity , Sikhism , Buddhism , Jainism , Judaism , Zoroastrianism , and the Bahá'í Faith . [278] India has the world's largest Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Zoroastrian, and Bahá'í populations, and has the third-largest Muslim population and the largest Muslim population for a non-Muslim majority country. [279] [280]
Culture
Main article: Culture of India
The Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya , Bihar commemorates the enlightenment of Gautama Buddha.
Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years. [281] During the Vedic period (c. 1700 – 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy , mythology , theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma , kárma , yóga , and mokṣa , were established. [21] India is notable for its religious diversity , with Hinduism , Buddhism , Sikhism , Islam , Christianity , and Jainism among the nation's major religions. [282] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads , [283] the Yoga Sutras , the Bhakti movement , [282] and by Buddhist philosophy . [284]
Art and architecture
Much of Indian architecture , including the Taj Mahal , other works of Mughal architecture , and South Indian architecture , blends ancient local traditions with imported styles. [285] Vernacular architecture is also highly regional in it flavours. Vastu shastra , literally "science of construction" or "architecture" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan , [286] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings; [287] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs. [288] As applied in Hindu temple architecture , it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras , a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the " absolute ". [289] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". [290] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture , developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture . [291]
Literature
Main article: Indian literature
The earliest literary writings in India, composed between 1700 BCE and 1200 CE, were in the Sanskrit language. [292] [293] Prominent works of this Sanskrit literature include epics such as the Mahābhārata and the Ramayana , the dramas of Kālidāsa such as the Abhijñānaśākuntalam ( The Recognition of Śakuntalā ), and poetry such as the Mahākāvya . [294] [295] [296] Kamasutra , the famous book about sexual intercourse also originated in India. Developed between 600 BCE and 300 CE in South India, the Sangam literature , consisting of 2,381 poems, is regarded as a predecessor of Tamil literature . [297] [298] [299] [300] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets such as Kabīr , Tulsīdās , and Guru Nānak . This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions. [301] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of Bengali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore . [302]
Performing arts
A Kuchipudi dance performance is accompanied by Carnatic vocalisations.
Indian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools. [303] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music ; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are the bhangra of Punjab, the bihu of Assam, the chhau of Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and the lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama . These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam. [304] Theatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue. [305] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka. [306]
Motion pictures, television
The Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema. [307] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese , Bengali , Bhojpuri , Hindi , Kannada , Malayalam , Punjabi , Gujarati , Marathi , Odia , Tamil , and Telugu languages. [308] South Indian cinema attracts more than 75% of national film revenue. [309]
Television broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication, and had slow expansion for more than two decades. [310] [311] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s and, since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped popular culture of Indian society. [312] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012 there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite and/or cable connections, compared to other forms of mass media such as press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million). [313]
Society

Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis , or "castes". [314] India declared untouchability to be illegal [315] in 1947 and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace in urban India and in international or leading Indian companies, the caste related identification has pretty much lost its importance. [316] [317] Family values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. [318] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family members. [319] Marriage is thought to be for life, [319] and the divorce rate is extremely low. [320] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women in India wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age. [321] Female infanticide in India and female foeticide in India have caused a discrepancy in the sex ratio, as of 2005 it was estimated that there were 50 million more males than females in the nation. [322] [323] However the recent report from 2011 shown improvement among the gender ratio. [324] The payment of dowry , although illegal , remains widespread across class lines. [325] Deaths resulting from dowry , mostly from bride burning , are on the rise. [326]
Many Indian festivals are religious in origin; among them are Chhath , Christmas , Diwali , Durga Puja , Bakr-Id , Eid ul-Fitr , Ganesh Chaturthi , Holi , Makar Sankranti or Uttarayan , Navratri , Thai Pongal , and Vaisakhi . India has three national holidays which are observed in all states and union territories: Republic Day , Independence Day , and Gandhi Jayanti . Other sets of holidays, va [4]
Fielding skills[ edit ]
Fielding in cricket requires a range of skills.
Close catchers require the ability to be able to take quick reaction catches with a high degree of consistency. This can require considerable efforts of concentration as a catcher may only be required to take one catch in an entire game, but his success in taking that catch may have a considerable effect on the outcome of the match.
Infielders field between 20 to 40 yards away from the batsman. The ball will often be hit at them extremely hard, and they require excellent athleticism as well as courage in stopping it from passing them. Infield catches range from simple, slow moving chances known as "dollies" to hard hit balls that require a spectacular diving catch. Finally, infielders are the main source of run outs in a game of cricket, and their ability to get to the ball quickly, throw it straight and hard and make a direct hit on the stumps is an important skill.
Outfielders field furthest from the bat, typically right on the boundary edge. Their main role is to prevent the ball from going over the boundary and scoring four or six runs. They need good footspeed to be able to get around the field quickly, and a strong arm to be able to make the 50–80-yard throw. Outfielders also often have to catch high hit balls that go over the infield.
Fielding specialities[ edit ]
Many cricketers are particularly adept in one fielding position and will usually be found there:
Slips and bat pad require fast reactions, an ability to anticipate the trajectory of the ball as soon as it takes the edge, and intense concentration. Most top slip fielders tend to be top-order batsmen like Virender Sehwag , Graeme Smith and Rahul Dravid (although Shane Warne , Andrew Flintoff and Graeme Swann are a few recent notable exceptions to this rule), as these are both skills that require excellent hand–eye coordination.
Pace bowlers will often be found fielding in the third man, fine leg and deep backward square positions during the overs between those they are bowling. These positions mean that they are at the correct end for their bowling over. They should see relatively little fielding action with plenty of time to react, allowing them to rest between overs. They also usually have an ability to throw the ball long distances accurately.
Players noted for their agility, acceleration, ground diving and throwing accuracy will often field in the infield positions such as point, cover and mid-wicket.
However, players are rarely selected purely because of their fielding skills, and all players are expected to win their place in the team as either a specialist batsman or bowler (or both). This even applies to wicket keepers, who are generally expected to be competent middle-order batsmen.
Throwing a cricket ball[ edit ]
There have been many competitions for throwing a cricket ball the furthest distance, particularly in the earlier years of the game. Wisden describes how the record was set around 1882, by one Robert Percival at Durham Sands Racecourse, at 140 yards and two feet (128.7 m). Former Essex all-rounder Ian Pont threw a ball 138 yards (126.19 m) in Cape Town in 1981. There are unconfirmed reports that Jānis Lūsis , the non-cricketer Soviet javelin thrower, who won the Olympic gold medal in 1968, once threw a ball 150 yards. [5]
Specialist fielding coaches[ edit ]

The use of specialist fielding coaches has become more prevalent in recent years, following the trend of specialist batting & bowling coaches within professional cricket. The most well known specialist fielding coaches currently working in cricket are:
Julien Fountain (joined West Indies cricket team in 1998, current Pakistan cricket team fielding coach, a former cricketer and British Olympic baseball player) [6]
Mike Young (joined Australia cricket team in 2001, a former professional baseball player, manager and coach)
Richard Halsall (joined England Cricket Team in 2008,a former PE teacher and former professional cricketer from Zimbabwe)

Conditions[ edit ]
In recent times, spin bowling has been a forte of the bowlers from the South Asian sub-continent. The primary reason for that is that the pitches in the sub-continent provide more help to the spin bowlers. The faster the pitch degenerates, the earlier the spinners come into the picture. Australian and South African pitches are usually very hard and bouncy, helping the fast bowlers more. They do not break up very much during the duration of the match. In contrast, pitches in the sub-continent are not that hard. They are not usually held together by the grass as much; hence they break up more quickly and help spin bowlers. In general, leg spin is considered to be one of the toughest types of bowling in which to keep control of the ball, but it is very effective in picking off wickets. [6]
Flight, turn, bounce, drift, dip[ edit ]
It is customary among cricket commentators to describe and judge the quality of spin bowling in terms of the characteristics flight, turn, bounce, drift, and dip. All these are arts to deceive the batsman and require lots of practice. The basic trajectory of spin bowling is two-lines-at-an-angle, but the above characteristics (described below) modify this 'normal' trajectory into more complex shapes.
Turn: How much the ball turns after pitching (e.g. 5 degree deviation after meeting the ground). It depends on the number and direction of revolutions of the ball. The movement and rotation of the ball varies, depending on the position of the wrist and the finger. An occasional unexpected straight ball can usefully be included in an attack, but spin variation is the main technique used to deceive the batsman and take wickets.
Bounce: Getting the ball to bounce more than normal, so that the ball meets the batsman at a greater height than expected. Sometimes, if the ball spins horizontally (e.g. a slider), the batsman will not be able to make contact with the ball and it may hit the stumps before the second bounce.
Drift: Getting the ball to move sideways while in air. Late drift causes the batsman to cover the wrong line and the ball may catch the edge of the bat.
Dip: Getting the ball to pitch (meet the ground) at a shorter distance than normal. Late dip causes the batsman to misjudge the length of the ball.
Flight : throwing the ball up a bit more than normal, so that its time in the air before pitching is longer. A slow ball with extra flight may deceive the batsman into thinking it is slower than it is and therefore mistiming his shot. This is very effective for offspinners. Usually a spin bowler relies on tricks during flight to produce turn, bounce, drift and dip, or combinations of them.

Earliest cricket[ edit ]
Cricket may have been played in Worcestershire during the 18th century, however the earliest reference to cricket in the county is 1829[ citation needed ] and the county cricket club was not formed until 1865. [1]
A match on 28 August 1844 at Hartlebury Common between Worcestershire and Shropshire is the earliest known instance of a county team in Worcestershire. Two years later, XXII of Worcestershire played William Clarke's All-England Eleven at Powick Hams.[ citation needed ]
Origin of the club[ edit ]
Worcestershire CCC was formed on 4 March 1865 at the Star Hotel in Worcester .
The club owes much to Paul Foley who was from a family of iron masters in Stourbridge . He also owned an agricultural estate at Stoke Edith in Herefordshire. He became involved with the club in the 1880s and helped to establish the Minor Counties Championship which began in 1895. Worcestershire shared the inaugural title with Durham and Norfolk before winning outright in 1896, 1897 and 1898.
With this success behind it, the club applied for first-class status and entered the County Championship in 1899. Worcestershire CCC played its initial first-class match versus Yorkshire CCC on 4, 5 & 6 May 1899.
The first-class county[ edit ]
The inclusion of Worcestershire increased the County Championship to 15 teams. At first they performed moderately despite the superb batting of Tip Foster , who could rarely play after 1901. Weak bowling on perfect New Road pitches was responsible for this, but in 1907 when Tip Foster played regularly for three months their batting, considering the difficulty of the pitches, was among the finest of any county team. Their best performance that year was an innings of 567 on a somewhat difficult pitch against Fielder and Blythe of Kent CCC . After that year, however, the batting was never strong enough to make up for woefully weak bowling.
Worcestershire were so weak the club could not compete in the Championship in 1919, and their form in 1920 – when they lost three successive games by an innings and over 200 runs – was probably the worst of any county side. Their form, with one remarkable exception, was woeful up to the early thirties. Fred Root , one of the first exponents of leg theory bowling, took over 1,500 wickets for the county and was a Test standard player in an otherwise fourth-rate team. In Cyril Walters and the Nawab of Pataudi the team acquired its first class batsmen since the Fosters, but both had to give up the game after playing brilliantly in 1933 – when the bowling was briefly very weak.
The emergence of Dick Howorth and Reg Perks in the 1930s, however, was built up so well that by 1947 Worcestershire were sufficiently strong in bowling to be competitive at county level even if their batting was not adequate for high honours. Roly Jenkins , with 183 wickets in 1949, gave them briefly the best attack in county cricket, but they soon declined again and their form in the 1950s was indifferent at best.
Their first period of great success came in the 1960s under the Presidency of Sir George Dowty and the captaincy of Don Kenyon , when the county won two County Championships thanks to the achievements of such players as Norman Gifford , Tom Graveney , Jack Flavell , Len Coldwell and Basil D'Oliveira . They were also losing finalist in the first ever Gillette Cup Final in 1963 - the inaugural limited overs knockout competition in England. [2] In 1971 Worcestershire won their first ever Sunday League title thanks largely to the bowling of Vanburn Holder and the New Zealander Glenn Turner was instrumental in Worcestershire's third championship win in 1974. In the 1980s, the prodigious batting feats of Graeme Hick and the arrival of Ian Botham paved the way for two more county titles in 1988 and 1989 - the same year in which they beat the touring Australians inside two days. [3] Worcestershire also won the Sunday League in 1987 and 1988.
Worcestershire's success continued into the 1990s, with a first ever success in the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1991, following final defeats in 1973, 1976 and 1990. Captained by Phil Neale, the Pears beat Lancashire by 65 runs in the final at Lord's, gaining revenge for defeat against Lancashire in the previous year's competition. [4] Worcestershire's next title came in 1994 when they won the Natwest Trophy, beating arch-rivals Warwickshire in the final. [5] Not only did they avenge their defeat at the hands of Warwickshire in the B&H Cup Final earlier that summer but it was also their first success in the competition after three previous final defeats. Worcestershire's best showing in the County Championship came in 1993 when they finished second to Middlesex. Worcestershire finished 15th in 1999, the final year of single division County Championship cricket, meaning they would start the new millennium in Division Two.
The modern day (2000-present)[ edit ]
Worcestershire failed to gain promotion in 2000, despite overseas signing Glenn McGrath taking 76 Championship wickets at an average of 13.77. [6] In 2003, Worcestershire were promoted to County Championship Division One for the first time after winning the Division Two title. [7] Worcestershire also reached the final of the Cheltenham & Gloucester trophy, beating Lancashire in a memorable semi-final at New Road on 9 August 2003. [8] There was disappointment in the Lord's final, though, as Worcestershire lost by seven wickets and the Pears were also relegated from Division One of the National League. 2004 was a yo-yo year with Worcestershire relegated in the County Championship, promoted back to Division One in the rebranded totesport League and losing finalists again in the C&G Trophy. Vikram Solanki scored centuries in both the semi-final win against Warwickshire [9] and the final against Gloucestershire, but the 'Gladiators' won by eight wickets at Lord's. [10]
In 2006, Worcestershire won promotion to the first division of the Championship on the last day of the season by beating Northamptonshire while their rivals for second promotion spot, Essex , lost to Leicestershire . However, their 2007 season began badly, including an innings-and-260-run loss to Yorkshire , Worcestershire's worst innings defeat since 1934. [11] A flood-hit season inflicted serious financial damage, and on-field results in the Championship gave little cheer as Worcestershire were relegated. However, in the Pro40 First Division things were very different, and victory over Gloucestershire in mid-September brought the title to New Road, the county's first trophy since 1994. [12] The feat was all the more remarkable for the fact that every one of Worcestershire's games was played away from their New Road home, due to the floods, with 'home' games played at Edgbaston, Taunton and Kidderminster. [13]
2008 saw Worcestershire promoted back to Division One, despite losing their final game of the season. [14] 2008 was also Graeme Hick's last season at Worcestershire, having scored 136 first-class centuries in 25 seasons at New Road. [15] 2009 proved disastrous in first-class cricket, with Worcestershire finishing bottom of the First Division without a single victory, the first time the county had failed to win a Championship match since 1928. [16]
Following a win on the last day of the season against Sussex, Worcestershire were promoted back to Division One in 2010. The following season they avoided relegation for the first time ever, giving them consecutive seasons in Division One. [17] However, at the end of the 2012 season they were relegated back to Division Two. [18] Worcestershire had a mixed campaign in 2013, finished fifth out of nine in Division Two but a bright start to the 2014 saw them second in the table after seven games, following a draw with Surrey in June.

[88] [89]
Warne was signed as a player for the Melbourne Stars in Australia's inaugural Big Bash League (BBL) in November 2011. The Stars qualified for the semi-finals of the tournament, and Warne took seven wickets in eight matches at an economy rate of 6.74 runs conceded per over. [90]
In 2013 Warne was fined $4500 and banned for one match for using obscene language, making inappropriate physical contact with a player or official ( Marlon Samuels ) and showing serious dissent at an umpire's decision during a BBL match. [91]
In July 2013, he officially retired from all formats confirming that he won't be captaining the Melbourne Stars in BBL. [5]
In July 2014, he captained the Rest of the World side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's . [92]
Playing style and influence[ edit ]
After an inauspicious start to his Test career, Warne revolutionised cricket thinking with his mastery of leg spin, which many cricket followers had come to regard as a dying art due to its immense difficulty of execution. For all his on-pitch and off-pitch controversies, Warne's place in cricketing posterity has been assured by the fact that he has overturned the domination of cricket by fast bowling that had prevailed for two decades before his debut. Despite the presence of high quality spin bowlers such as the Indian spin quartet of the 1970s or Abdul Qadir on the Test scene, Australia's fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had dominated cricket in the early 1970s. Furthermore, from 1976 until the early 1990s, the West Indies had lost only one (ill-tempered and controversial) Test series with a bowling attack almost exclusively comprising fast bowlers. In the early 1990s, with the West Indies on the wane, Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram of Pakistan were assuming the mantle of the world's most feared bowling combination. It was in that context that Warne's tormenting of batsmen became so significant rather than his actual statistics. His humiliation of Mike Gatting and subsequent dominance, in particular, of English and South African batsmen, provided a welcome sight for cricket watchers weary of the relentless intimidation by West Indian bowlers of the 1980s and 1990s. His treatment of South African batsman Daryll Cullinan was such that Cullinan was said to have sought the help of a therapist to overcome Warne's psychological hold. [93]
Warne combined the ability to turn the ball prodigiously, even on unhelpful pitches , with unerring accuracy and a variation of deliveries (notable among these being the flipper ) In the latter stages of his career, variation was less evident, despite regular press conferences announcing a "new" delivery for each series he participated in. Gideon Haigh , the Australian journalist, said of Warne upon his retirement: "It was said of Augustus that he found Rome brick and left it marble: the same is true of Warne and spin bowling." [94]
Where my ability to spin a cricket ball came from, I honestly don't know. I can only think that I was born with it. I have a skill as cricketer and fortunately cricket found me. [95]
– Shane Warne
Many of his most spectacular performances have occurred in Ashes series against England In particular, the famous "Gatting Ball", otherwise known as the " Ball of the Century " which spun sharply and bowled a bemused Mike Gatting in the 1993 Ashes series. Conversely, he has struggled against India , particularly against Sachin Tendulkar : his bowling average against India is 47.18 runs per wicket, compared with his overall average of less than 26. [96] In fairness to Warne, other foreign spinners have also struggled against India in recent years; Warne's contemporary off-spinner rival, Muttiah Muralitharan , for instance, has a much higher bowling average (32.61) in Tests played in India than his overall Test figures. [97]
As well as his Test career Warne has been highly effective bowling in one-day cricket , something few other leg spin bowlers have managed. He also captained Australia on several occasions in One Day Internationals , winning ten matches and losing only one. Warne was instrumental in helping Australia win the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England. His performances in the semifinal against South Africa and in the final against Pakistan helped him get Man of the Match Awards. Warne had intended to retire from ODI cricket at the end of the 2003 World Cup: as it transpired, his last game for Australia was in January 2003. However, he did appear for the ICC World XI for the Tsunami benefit match in 2005.
Warne is also noted for his exuberant (and sometimes effective) lower-order batting , once famously being dismissed for 99 with a reckless shot on what was later shown to be a no ball . In fact, of all Test cricketers Warne has scored the most Test runs without having scored a century, with two scores in the nineties being his best efforts (99 and 91). Warne is also third overall in the most international test ducks. Of players who have batted in more than 175 Test innings, his proportion of dismissals by being out bowled is the lowest, at under seven percent. [98] In 2006 Warne and Glenn McGrath reportedly lost a bet of which bowler would be the first to get a Test century with fellow Australian bowler Jason Gillespie after Gillespie scored a record double-century as a nightwatchman against Bangladesh.
Warne has also been a successful slip fielder , and is currently seventh in the list of most catches as a fielder in test cricket.
Media[ edit ]
On 13 July 2005, Australia's Nine Network announced it would not renew Warne's commentating contract, worth around A$300,000 annually. [99] Warne had previously been seen as a future member of the Nine cricket commentary team, and had done commentary work during his one-year ban from cricket in 2003. He later rejoined Nine in 2008, and was signed by Sky Sports in 2009. [100]
Warne took over from Ally McCoist as a team captain on the BBC television sports quiz A Question of Sport in September 2007.
In 2010, the Nine Network commissioned a chat show hosted by Warne, entitled Warnie. The program debuted on 24 November 2010, with Warne interviewing James Packer . [101] Celebrities interviewed on the programme included then captain of the Australian cricket team Ricky Ponting , and the singers Chris Martin and Susan Boyle . [102] [103] The program experienced spiralling audience figures and was axed before its final scheduled episode, although the network denied that it had been cancelled due to poor ratings. [104]
Endorsements[ edit ]
In 2005, Shane Warne signed a lucrative multi-year sponsorship deal [105] [106] with Messages On Hold. The irony of Warne promoting On Hold phone messages after weathering the ignominy of several SMS/ text messaging scandals was not lost on the spin bowler. [107] Several media sources, and even Messages On Hold’s own promotional materials quote him as saying, "Trust me with this recommendation—I know a thing or two about spin." [108]
Warne also does promotional work for hair-loss-recovery company Advanced Hair. This matter was investigated by the British Advertising Standards Authority in relation to an illegal celebrity endorsement of medical services. [109]
Warne has also endorsed the Codemaster video games Shane Warne Cricket and Shane Warne Cricket '99. Outside Australia these were known as Brian Lara Cricket and Brian Lara Cricket '99.
For the 2007/08 Australian cricket series , Warne took over as Victoria Bitter spokesperson from David Boon in the Boonanza promotion. [110] Warne had a talking figurine as part of the promotion, which continued from the "Talking Boony" doll. [111]
In January 2008, Warne signed a two-year agreement with 888poker to represent them at poker events around the world including the Aussie Millions , World Series of Poker and the 888 UK Poker Open . This sponsorship agreement ended in January 2015. [112]
Personal life[ edit ]
Warne has three children—Brooke, Summer and Jackson—with his ex-wife Simone Callahan.
Since retirement, Warne has been doing "work for the Shane Warne Foundation ... [which] assists seriously ill and underprivileged children." [113] Since launching in 2004, the charity has distributed £400,000; its activities include a charity poker tournament and a breakfast and "by the end of our summer, we hope to have raised £1.5 million." [113]
Warne's private life has been beset by scandals and subjected to scrutiny by British tabloid newspapers. He came under criticism for text messaging a woman while on tour in South Africa, accused of sending lewd and harassing messages. However, the woman who made the claims was subsequently charged with extortion in her own country. [114]
In 2000, he lost his Australian vice-captaincy after sending erotic text messages to a British nurse. He was also involved in an altercation with some teenage boys who took a photo of him smoking; Warne had accepted a sponsorship of a nicotine patch company in return for quitting smoking. [115]
Allegations of extramarital affairs broke in 2005 as Australia began its tour of England in preparation for The Ashes . On 25 June 2005, Warne and his wife Simone Callahan announced that they had decided to separate.
On 7 May 2006, the News of the World tabloid newspaper published pictures of Warne standing in his underwear with models Coralie Eichholz and Emma Kearney , as well as explicit text messages allegedly from Warne. [116]
On 1 April 2007, Warne and his wife were reported to be getting back together. [117] However, in September 2007, Simone returned to Australia from England after her husband had accidentally sent a text message meant for another woman to her phone. [118] [119]
Warne's history of high-profile marital infidelities inspired Australian singer-songwriter Kevin Bloody Wilson 's 2003 music video entitled "The Shane Warne Song" as well as lines in Tim Minchin 's "Some People Have It Worse Than Me" and "The JLA Song".
On 12 December 2010, following press reports and footage of him and English actress Elizabeth Hurley kissing, Warne announced via his Twitter account that he and Simone had separated a couple of months previously, but only his close friends and family had been informed. [120] [121] [122] Although the relationship with Hurley at first seemed short-lived following the disclosure of Warne texting salacious messages to a married Melbourne businesswoman, [123] [124] the couple created a media frenzy when Hurley later moved into Warne's Brighton mansion. [125] On 30 September 2011, it was reported that Hurley and Warne were engaged and she was spotted wearing a large sapphire ring; [126] their engagement was confirmed via Twitter shortly thereafter. [127] On December 17, 2013, WHO Magazine confirmed that the couple had "called off" their engagement. [128]
Controversies[ edit ]
In early December 1998, the Australian Cricket Board revealed that three years earlier it had fined Warne and Mark Waugh for accepting money from a bookmaker for giving information about pitch and weather conditions. [129]
Just before the start of the 1999 World Cup, he was given a fine and a two-match suspended ban by the International Cricket Council for telling a newspaper about Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga that: "There is plenty of animosity between Arjuna and myself. I don't like him and I'm not in a club of one". [43]
In February 2003, a day before the start of the World Cup , Warne was sent home after a drug test during a one-day series in Australia returned a positive result for a banned diuretic . [68] Warne claimed that he took only one of what he called a "fluid tablet" – the prescription drug Moduretic – given to him by his mother to improve his appearance. [69] A committee established by the Australian Cricket Board found Warne guilty of breaching the Board's drug code, and imposed a one-year ban from organised cricket. [70]
In 2013, Warne was fined $4500 and banned for one match for using obscene language, making inappropriate physical contact with a player or official ( Marlon Samuels ) and showing serious dissent at an umpire's decision during a BBL match. [91]

Early life and education[ edit ]
Lalit Modi was born in Delhi in 1963, into one of India's leading business families. [1] His parents are Krishan Kumar Modi and Bina Modi . He has an elder sister, Charu Modi Bhatia , and a younger brother, Samir Modi . [2] His grandfather Gujar Mal Modi had established a business conglomerate and the town of Modinagar . His father KK Modi greatly expanded the family business. [3] [4] :191
Lalit Modi joined Bishop Cotton School in Shimla , in 1971. [5] His family later moved him to St Joseph's College, Nainital , because of a kidnapping threat. [6] In 1980, he was expelled from St. Joseph's for bunking off to watch a movie. [7]
Between 1983 and 1986, Modi studied Electrical Engineering and Business Administration in the United States. He attended Pace University in New York for two years, and then Duke University in North Carolina for one year. He didn't graduate from either of these institutions. In 1985, while a sophomore , Modi and three other students tried to buy half a kilogram of cocaine for $10,000 at a motel. The man posing as a seller threatened them with a shotgun, and robbed them of $10,000. The next day, Modi and his friends beat up a student, whom they suspected of setting them up. [6] As a result, on 1 March 1985, Modi was arrested on charges of conspiracy to traffic cocaine, assault and second-degree kidnapping. The next day, Modi and another student were indicted. [8] Modi pleaded guilty to the crime when the case was heard in the Durham County court, North Carolina and later entered a plea bargain, which resulted in a suspended two-year prison sentence. [9] In lieu of prison time, he was placed under a five-year probation and ordered to do 100 hours' community service. In 1986, Modi sought permission from court to return to India, citing bad health. The Durham County Court accepted his plea and ordered him to perform 200 hours of community service in India. [6] Modi's return to India was facilitated by some of his father's businessmen friends, including Leonard Lauder . [10]
In 1986, Modi came back to Delhi, and joined the family business. He served as the President of International Tobacco Company Limited from 1987 to 1991. On 21 August 1989, he was made a Non-Executive & Non-Independent Director at Godfrey Phillips India , one of India's largest tobacco companies, and a joint venture between his family's Modi Enterprises and Philip Morris International . In February 1992, he was made an Executive Director of Godfrey Phillips India, and retained that position until 1 August 2010. [11]
In Delhi, Modi started courting his mother's friend Minal Sagrani. His family initially opposed the marriage, as Minal was a recently divorced mother and nine years elder to him. Modi managed to get his grandmother Dayawati Modi on his side, who convinced the family to agree to the marriage. Lalit and Minal married on 17 October 1991 in Mumbai . The couple settled in Mumbai, as Minal faced social boycott in Delhi. They initially lived in KK Modi's apartment in Pedder Road area, but later bought Minal's father's house in Juhu as their family grew. They have two children - son Ruchir and daughter Aliya. Lalit Modi also has a step-daughter Karima Sagrani, from Minal's first marriage. [10] [12]
Early business career[ edit ]
In 1993, Modi established Modi Entertainment Networks (MEN), using money from a family trust. MEN started as a 10-year joint venture with Walt Disney Pictures , to broadcast some of Disney's content in India, including Fashion TV . [13] [14] In 1994, MEN became the pan-India distributor of ESPN on a ten-year contract worth $975 million. His job was to collect money from the cable companies in India in exchange for them broadcasting ESPN . [3] ESPN did not renew its contract with Modi, alleging that he underreported revenues. MEN also lost a contract with Fashion TV, after Modi fell out with its founder Michel Adam Lisowski . [6] Most of Modi's businesses in Mumbai were not profitable, and he lived on a maintenance allowance from his father's company. [10]
Later, Modi became the President and Managing Director of Modi Enterprises, an industrial conglomerate run by his family. [15] [16]
In 2002, Modi launched an online lottery business in Kerala called Sixo. [17]
Cricket administration[ edit ]
In the USA, Modi had been impressed by the huge revenues of the American sports leagues. In 1995, he pitched his idea for a new 50-over tournament to BCCI. He even registered a name - Indian Cricket League Limited - for the proposed league. However, the BCCI did not take the proposal seriously. Modi then resolved to join the Board. As a step towards this goal, in 1999, he managed to get elected to the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association , a constituent body of BCCI. [4] :166 However, his attempt to gain control of the Association failed, and he was forced to leave the Association by the Chief Minister of the state. [18] In 2004, Modi was elected as the Vice-President of the Punjab Cricket Association , under the President Inderjit Singh Bindra. [12] He retained this position in the 2008 elections. [19]
Rajasthan Cricket Association[ edit ]
In 2003, Modi's friend Vasundhara Raje was elected as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan . Modi knew Raje through a common school friend Bina Kilachand, and had become one of the Chief Minister's closest associates. [10]
After his failed stint in Himachal Pradesh, Modi decided to gain control of the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA), another constituency body of BCCI. The RCA had been controlled by the Rungta business family for over three decades. It had 32 district associations as its constituent members, plus 66 individual members - all of whom were members or peons of the Rungta household. During the 1980s and 1990s, there were several unsuccessful attempts to eject the Rungta family from the RCA. After Vasundhara Raje became the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, a faction led by Modi started fresh attempts to defeat the Rungtas. Modi registered himself with the RCA under the name "Lalit Kumar", as a member of the Nagore district 's cricket association. He didn't use his full name for the fear of being denied entry. [18] [20]
In 2005, Modi used his connections with Raje to get the Rajasthan Sports Act passed. This ordinance took away voting rights from the 66 individual members, leaving only the 32 district associations as voters. [21] As a result, Modi was elected as the President of RCA, defeating the incumbent Kishore Rungta by just 1 vote. [22]
As the RCA President, he spent ₹ 200 million to renovate Jaipur's Sawai Mansingh Stadium, making it one of the best cricket stadiums in the country. He spent another ₹ 70 million to build a state-of-the-art cricket academy. [2] He sold the boundary-rope advertising for ₹ 1.5 million per spot, more than double the previous rate. He also ended the practice of giving away tickets for free and sold corporate box seats for ₹ 125,000 each. [6]
Board of Control for Cricket in India[ edit ]
After becoming the RCA President in 2005, Modi helped the Indian National Congress leader Sharad Pawar defeat Jagmohan Dalmiya in the BCCI Presidential elections. [10] Subsequently, Modi was appointed Vice-President of the BCCI. [23]
Lalit Modi was heavily involved in the commercial side of the BCCI. Between 2005 and 2008, BCCI's revenues increased sevenfold, touching the $1 billion mark. [24]
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
In 2008, Lalit Modi was instrumental in launching the Indian Premier League (IPL), based around Twenty20 cricket. He also engineered the IPL's move to South Africa in 2009, after the dates of the tournament clashed with the Indian general election and the Union Minister of Home Affairs , P. Chidambaram, could not commit to the security of the tournament. [25] [25] [26] The IPL grew into one of the world's biggest sports league, worth over $4 billion. The commercial success of IPL and Modi's control of the league led to him being compared to Don King and Bernie Ecclestone. [27]
Modi's family and friends also profited from IPL. Suresh Chellaram, his brother-in-law (husband of his sister Kavita), owned a majority share in the Rajasthan Royals franchise. His step-daughter Karima's husband Gaurav Burman was a stakeholder in Global Cricket Venture, which won the digital, mobile and internet rights of the IPL. Gaurav's brother Mohit Burman was a stakeholder in Kings XI Punjab . Jay Mehta , one of the owners of Kolkata Knight Riders , is a childhood friend of Lalit Modi. [10] Rajasthan Royals, Kings XI Punjab and Kolkata Knight Riders were the cheapest franchises and very closely priced, leading to speculation that Modi had passed on insider information to the owners. [12]
Role in Rajasthan politics[ edit ]
As a close associate of the Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, Lalit Modi became a powerful figure in Rajasthan, and came to be known as a "super chief minister". He continued to live in Mumbai, where his network had expanded to include leading industrialists and Bollywood stars. He visited Jaipur frequently, and stayed at the Rambagh Palace , where ministers and civil servants would queue up to meet him and ask for favours. [20]
Modi entered the real estate business with a company called Amer Heritage City Construction Pvt Ltd, where his wife, Minal, served as a director. [28] Modi pressured local officials and secured control of two havelis near the Amer Fort , in contravention of Archaeological Survey of India 's rules. [12] He intended to renovate and convert these havelis into a heritage resort. Mahant Shiv Prakash Bhattacharya, the 75-year-old titleholder of the Choor Singh ki Haveli, initiated a court case to thwart Modi's attempt to take over his haveli. [29] During Raje's tenure, the Jaipur Development Authority framed ad-hoc rules to allow re-classification of agricultural land and its use for non-agricultural purposes. This change, which benefited several big builders from Delhi, was allegedly presided over by Lalit Modi. [29]
In 2007, Modi refused to allow the IAS officer Mahendra Surana watch a match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, because he believed Suarana to be an associate of the Rungta faction of RCA. When Surana and his friend Hemendra Suarana (an army doctor and a former Ranji player) arrived at the Stadium, Modi tore their tickets. He repeated this act with the IPS officer R.P. Srivastava. [29] During a cricket match, he slapped a constable for walking into his box at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, leading to protests by the city's constabulary. [29]
Modi's increasing power in Rajasthan politics became a key issue in the 2008 Rajasthan elections , which Raje lost. Ashok Gehlot of Congress, who succeeded Raje as the Chief Minister, accused Modi of acting as an "extra-constitutional authority" during his campaign.
After Raje was voted out of power, Modi's power in Rajasthan reduced considerably. In January 2009, he had spent several hours at a police station after an FIR was registered on the basis of a complaint by a Samajwadi Party activist for forgery. [29] In March 2009, his faction lost the RCA election. The new leadership appointed a committee to probe alleged financial irregularities during his regime. [2]
Kochi Tuskers Kerala controversy[ edit ]
By 2009, suggestions of a rivalry between Modi and N. Srinivasan surfaced. [21] During 2009-2010, Lalit Modi oversaw the bidding process for induction of two new teams in the Indian Premier League. In December 2009, he inserted two new clauses in the invitation to tender (ITT): the bidder should have a net worth of at least USD 1 billion and must provide a bank guarantee of USD 100 million. Modi stated that these clauses protected BCCI's interests. However, other BCCI board members claimed that he was rigging bids to suit Adani Group and Videocon Group , as the new clauses would rule out most of the other prospective bidders. After the ITT was floated on 22 February 2010, some of the prospective bidders, including Sahara Group and Jagran Group , complained to the BCCI President Shashank Manohar that they were being deliberately kept out of the tendering process. [30] After receiving only two bids, IPL changed the ITT, removing the net worth clause and reducing the guarantee amount to USD 10 million. [31]
In March 2010, a consortium of investors led by Rendezvous Sports World (RSW) won a bid for the Kerala -based Kochi Tuskers Kerala franchise. Indian National Congress leader and External Affairs minister Shashi Tharoor was involved in bringing together the various companies in this consortium. At that time, both Modi and Tharoor stated that the minister had no stake in the franchise, and was only facilitating a team for his native state Kerala. [32] On 11 April 2010, when a formal agreement was being signed between BCCI and the Kochi franchise, Modi asked the Kochi representatives about the identities of the sweat equity holders in the franchise. According to Modi, he received "evasive replies", and subsequently, a call from Tharoor instructing him not to probe the identities of Kochi's stakeholders. One of the sweat equity holders was Sunanda Pushkar , a close friend (and later wife) of Shashi Tharoor. Shortly after the agreement was signed, Modi disclosed the names of Kochi's stakeholders via a tweet . [30] Modi alleged that Pushkar's shares were actually a hidden gift to Tharoor. RSW threatened to sue Modi for violating confidentiality agreement, and claimed that Modi was creating problems for Kochi because he wanted other bidders to win. Tharoor denied that he had any financial stake in the Kochi franchise, and stated that his role was limited to offering "encouragement, blessings and expert advise" to the RSW-led group of bidders. [33] Tharoor argued that there was no reason for the investors to bribe him, since he had no influence over the auction. Sunanda Pushkar stated that she would give up her stake in the Kochi franchise. Ultimately, Tharoor had to resign as a minister amid allegations of corruption. [34]
Expulsion from BCCI and exile in London[ edit ]
On 16 April 2010, the representatives of the Kochi franchise complained to BCCI that Lalit Modi had threatened them to give up the franchise. A day after the IPL final on 24 April, BCCI suspended Modi on 22 charges, including bypassing the governing council while taking decisions, not following proper processes, bid rigging , awarding contracts to his friends, accepting kickbacks on a broadcast deal, selling franchises to members of his family, betting and money laundering . Soon after his suspension, Modi moved to London, where his wife Minal's family lived. [6] In London, he hired Carter-Ruck to fight BCCI's charges, and sent out defamation notices of his own. He also spent time expanding his family business in Europe. [6] Modi believed that N Srinivasan, who later became the BCCI President, had masterminded his ouster from BCCI. In 2012, Modi alleged that Srinivasan had fixed the auction of Andrew Flintoff in 2009. He also supported Aditya Verma, the secretary of Cricket Association of Bihar, who was fighting a separate legal battle against Srinivasan. [21]
Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate of the Congress-led Indian government launched investigations in following cases against Modi and other BCCI officials: [35]
Contravening the provisions of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) to the extent of ₹ 890 million (a charge against Lalit Modi, BCCI and few other officials). Modi blamed N Srinivasan, who was the treasurer of BCCI at the time.
Accepting deposit of ₹ 200 million from UK-based Emerging Media (IPL), in contravention of FEMA (charge against Modi, BCCI, N Srinivasan and Niranjan Shah)
Payment of ₹ 2.43 billion to Cricket South Africa for IPL 2009, in contravention of FEMA (charge against Modi, BCCI, Shashank Manohar and other BCCI officials)
Payment of USD 80 million to World Sports Group (WSG) by Multi Screen Media (MSM), as facilitation fees to withdraw from the telecast rights contract
Routing of USD 25 million from MSM-WSG deal to illegal accounts of Lalit Modi, his associates and politicial beneficiaries
Telling selective bidders how much to bid during the first IPL team auction in 2008
Using illegal money to buy corporate jet through a Cayman Islands company
Investment of ₹ 100 million by Modi's wife in Indian heritage hotel through a Mauritius-based company
Other cases related to FEMA violations, including ownership of IPL franchisee, nature of foreign investments, and valuation and transfer of shares
Modi defended himself arguing that he was not individually responsible for the decisions: BCCI and its committees took these decisions collectively. [36] He refused to return to India, stating that there was a threat to his life. The Mumbai Police endorsed his claim, stating that underworld gangsters had threatened him after he refused to pay extortion money. Dawood Ibrahim and his associate Chhota Shakeel had sent hitmen to kill Modi and his family, when the Modis were on a vacation in Thailand. [37] [38]
In 2010, Modi claimed on Twitter that New Zealand cricketer Chris Cairns had been involved in match-fixing during 2008. In March 2012, Cairns successfully sued Modi for making false statements and won $950,000 in damages. [39]
In 2013, a BCCI committee found Modi guilty on 8 charges, which resulted in his expulsion from BCCI. The committee was led by the BCCI vice-president and BJP leader Arun Jaitley ; its other members included the Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and Chirayu Amin . [40] The charges against Modi included: [41]
Rigging bids: Adding two onerous clauses to the invitation to tender draft without informing the BCCI, to favour two bidders. (Modi claimed that he had verbally informed the BCCI President Shashank Manohar).
Threatening a representative of the Kochi Tuskers Kerala to give up their franchise rights or face sanctions
Favouring World Sports Group (WSG) for TV rights
Failing to disclose links to owners with interests in Internet rights (Guarav Burman, his step-daughter's husband, held a stake in Global Cricket Venture)
Misconduct of threatening to "expose certain individuals in the BCCI" via tweets
Planning a rival cricket league with clubs in England
Awarding theatrical rights to a company without the governing council's approval
Signing a free commercial time deal with an agency without the governing council's approval
As a result, BCCI banned Modi for life in 2013. [42]
Re-election and ouster from RCA[ edit ]
In December 2013, the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) held fresh elections. However, the results were postponed 6 times by the Supreme Court due to court cases filed by Kishore Rungta and the BCCI. [22] On 6 May 2014, Lalit Modi was re-elected as the President of Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA), while residing in London. Immediately after his election, the BCCI banned the RCA and elected an adhoc body to carry administrative function of RCA. Lalit Modi took the legal route to fight BCCI's declaration. [43]
In March 2014, Modi alleged that the International Cricket Council (ICC) had evidence regarding the existence of spot and match-fixing in the Champions League T20 cricket tournament and that world cricket's governing body was deliberately not making it public. [44]
On 9 March 2015, a group led by Amin Pathan moved a no-confidence motion against Lalit Modi, who was until then, the President of RCA. According to the Rajasthan State Sports Act, a minimum attendance of 23 was required ಗ್ರ ಸ್ಥಾನ ಗಳಿಸಿದ ವಿಕೆಟ್-ಕೀಪರ್ ಗಳು1

Purposes
The keeper's major function is to stop deliveries that pass the batsman (in order to prevent runs being scored as 'byes'), but he can also attempt to dismiss the batsman in various ways:
The most common dismissal effected by the keeper is for him to catch a ball that has nicked the batsman's bat, called an edge, before it bounces. Sometimes the keeper is also in the best position to catch a ball which has been hit high in the air. More catches are taken by wicket-keepers than by any other fielding position.
The keeper can stump the batsman by using the ball to remove the bails from the stumps , if the batsman has come out of his crease during a delivery.
When the ball is hit into the outfield, the keeper moves close to the stumps to catch the return throw from a fielder and, if possible, to run out a batsman.
A keeper's position depends on the bowler : for fast bowling he will crouch some distance from the stumps, in order to have time to react to edges from the batsman, while for slower bowling, he will come much nearer to the stumps (known as "standing up"), to pressure the batsman into remaining within the crease or risk being stumped. The more skilled the keeper, the faster the bowling to which he is able to "stand up", for instance Godfrey Evans often stood up to Alec Bedser . [3]
Wicket-keeping is a specialist discipline and it requires training consistent with the level expected of a specialist batsman or bowler . However, the modern-day keeper is also expected to possess reasonable batting skill, suiting him for the middle order at least. Wicket-keepers who are also capable of batting at the top of the order are known informally as keeper/batsmen.
Since there is only room for one keeper in a cricket side, selectors (especially at the international level) are often faced with a difficult choice between two or more skilled keepers. Often, one of the two keepers is an exceptional keeper, but only an average batsman, whereas the other is a keeper/batsman who is clearly better at batting, but not quite as good a keeper as his rival. One such selection dilemma was that faced by England selectors in the 1990s between Jack Russell (the pure keeper) and Alec Stewart (the keeper/batsman). They were never able to consistently choose between the two until 1998, when Russell began to fade: prior to that, they had regularly swapped the role, often with Stewart maintaining his place when not wicket-keeping thanks to his batting skill.
The keeper may also have a captaincy role. Uniquely, they are usually involved in every delivery of an innings, and may be in a position to see things that the captain misses. They can frequently be heard encouraging the bowler, and may also indulge in the practice (not meant to be overheard) of " sledging " the batsman with well timed comments about their skill, appearance or personal habits.
The keeper is the only fielder allowed to touch the ball with protective equipment, typically large padded gloves with webbing between the index finger and thumb, but no other webbing. The protection offered by the gloves is not always adequate. The England keeper Alan Knott sometimes placed steaks inside his gloves for added cushioning. Wicket-keepers also tend to wear leg pads and a box to protect the groin area.
Wicket-keepers are allowed to take off their pads and bowl, though this rarely happens but is not uncommon when matches are drifting to draws or a bowling team is desperate for a wicket. Two keepers have removed their pads and taken hat-tricks in first-class cricket: Probir Sen for Bengal v Orissa at Cuttack in 1954–55 and A.C. (Alan) Smith for Warwickshire v Essex at Clacton in 1965; Smith was a most unusual player in that he was primarily a wicket-keeper, but was sometimes selected as a frontline bowler.
Legal specifications of wicket-keeping gloves
Wicket keeping gloves along with the inner gloves
Law 40.2, which deals with the specifications for wicketkeepers' gloves, states that: If,.... the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the fingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. If used, the webbing shall be:
(a) a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing material attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks.
(b) such that the top edge of the webbing-
(i) does not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to the top of the thumb.
(ii) is taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended. [4]
Substitutes
According to Law 2 of the Laws of Cricket, a substitute (taking the place of an ill or injured player) may not keep wicket. [5]
This rule is sometimes suspended, by agreement with the captain of the batting side, although Law 2 does not provide for such agreement to be made. For example, during the England–New Zealand Test Match at Lord's in 1986, England's specialist keeper, Bruce French was injured during England's first innings. England then used 4 keepers in New Zealand's first innings: Bill Athey kept for the first two overs; 45-year-old veteran Bob Taylor was pulled out of the sponsor's tent to keep, immaculately, for overs 3 to 76; Bobby Parks , the Hampshire keeper, was called up for overs 77 to 140; and Bruce French kept wicket for the final ball of the innings. [6] The same two teams were involved in a wicketkeeper switch in 2015 when BJ Watling was injured, and his gloves was given to Tom Latham for the entire 2nd innings. In the second Test, however, both were relieved of their wicketkeeping duties, allowing Luke Ronchi to make his Test debut, having played many matches for both Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand also used 4 wicketkeepers for the 2nd Test, even when Brendon McCullum has given up wicket-keeping completely since 2013.
Occasional wicket-keepers
Occasional wicket-keepers are players that usually play in other roles but sometimes keep wicket. Rahul Dravid , John Wisden was described as an occasional wicket-keeper. [7] Other players who have been described as occasional wicket-keepers include Ambati Rayudu , [8] Lokesh Rahul , [9] Johnson Charles , [10] Peter Handscomb ., [11] Tillakaratne Dilshan , Lendl Simmons , Eoin Morgan , Phillip Hughes , and Everton Weekes .
Playing without a wicket-keeper
There is no rule stating a team must play a wicket-keeper. [12] On 5 June 2015 during a T20 Blast game between the Worcestershire Rapids and the Northamptonshire Steelbacks , Worcestershire chose not to play a wicket-keeper in the 16th over of the match. [13] Their keeper, Ben Cox , became an extra fielder at fly slip while spinner Moeen Ali bowled. [13] The umpires consulted with each other and agreed that there was nothing in the rules to prevent it from happening. [14]

Orthodox technique and strokeplay[ edit ]
Names of orthodox cricket shots and the directions in which they are hit for a right-handed batsman. The batsman is standing at the centre point facing south. The positions are mirrored for left-handers.
Over time a standard batting technique has been developed which is used by most batsmen. Technique refers to the batsman's stance before the ball is bowled as well as the movement of the hands, feet, head and body in the execution of a cricket stroke. Good technique is characterised by quickly getting into the correct position to play the shot, especially getting one's head and body in line with the ball , one's feet placed next to where the ball would bounce and then swinging the bat at the ball to make contact at the precise moment required for the particular stroke being played.
The movement of the batsman for a particular delivery depends on the shot being attempted. Front-foot shots are played with the weight on the front foot (left foot for a right-hander) and are usually played when the ball is pitched up to the batsman, while back-foot shots are played putting the weight onto the back foot, usually to bowling that is pitched short. Shots may also be described as vertical bat shots, in which the bat is swung vertically at the ball (e.g. when playing a drive or leg glance), or horizontal or cross-bat shots, in which the bat is swung horizontally at the ball (e.g. when playing the pull or cut shot).
While a batsman is not limited in where or how he may hit the ball, the development of good technique has gone hand in hand with the development of standard or orthodox cricket shots played to specific types of deliveries. These "textbook" shots are standard material found in many coaching manuals.
The advent of limited overs cricket , with its emphasis on rapid run-scoring, has led to increasing use of unorthodox shots to hit the ball into gaps where there are no fielders . Unorthodox shots are typically—but not always— more high-risk than orthodox shots due to some aspects of good batting technique being abandoned.
Stance[ edit ]
The stance is the position in which a batsman stands in order to have the ball bowled to him. An ideal stance is "comfortable relaxed and balanced," with the feet 40 centimetres (16 in) apart, parallel and astride the crease. Additionally, the front shoulder should be pointing down the wicket, the head facing the bowler, the weight equally balanced and the bat near the back toe. [1] As the ball is about to be released, the batsman will lift his bat up behind up in anticipation of playing a stroke, and will shift his weight onto the balls of his feet. By doing this he is ready to move swiftly into position to address the ball once he sees its path out of the bowler's hand.
Although this text-book, side-on stance is the most common, a few international batsmen, such as Shivnarine Chanderpaul , use an "open" or "square on" stance.
Backlift[ edit ]
Backlift is the term used to describe how a batsman lifts his bat in preparation for hitting the ball. [2]
While the bat should be raised as vertically as possible, coaching manuals often suggest that correct technique is for the bat to be slightly angled from the perpendicular; a common instruction is to point the face of the bat in the direction of first or second slip . [2]
Some players (notably, in recent times, Brian Lara ) [3] have employed an exaggerated backlift. Others, who have employed the more unorthodox open stance, such as Peter Willey , had a more abbreviated backlift.
Forward and back[ edit ]
Depending upon the path of the ball, the batsman will either move forward or back in his attempt to intercept it. A forward movement is designated a front foot shot, whereas a backwards movement is designated a back foot shot. A front foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between ankle and thigh height. The batsman will step forward towards the ball, bending his front knee in order to bring his bat down to the anticipated height of the ball. By moving forwards, the batsman is also able to intercept the ball immediately after it has pitched, thus nullifying any potentially dangerous lateral movement. A back foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between thigh and head height. The batsman will step back and, if necessary, stand on his tip toes to raise his bat to the height of the ball. By stepping back towards the wicket, he also receives the advantage of having an extra small amount of time to react to any unexpected lateral movement or variation in bounce. The famous 'back drive', made famous by Sir Donald Bradman. This involves the use of deft footwork and skilled bat handling to allow the impression of a genuine front foot shot when the batsmen is actually on the back foot- thus the stroke being given the name 'back drive'.
Leave[ edit ]
The leave. Note the batsman's head focussed on where the ball had bounced. The bat and hands are held well out of the way of the ball.
The leave is sometimes considered a cricket shot, even though the batsman physically does not play at or interfere with the ball as it passes him. The leave is likely to be used by batsmen during the first few balls they receive, to give themselves time to judge the conditions of the pitch and the bowling before attempting to play a shot. Leaving a delivery is a matter of judgement and technique. The batsman still has to watch the ball closely to ensure that it will not hit him or the wicket; he also has to ensure that his bat and hands are kept out of the path of the ball so that it cannot make accidental contact and possibly lead to him being out caught .
Vertical bat strokes[ edit ]
Vertical bat or straight-bat shots can be played either off the front foot or the back foot depending upon the anticipated height of the ball at the moment it reaches the batsman. The characteristic position of the bat is a vertical alignment at point of contact. Vertical bat shots are typically played with the batsman's head directly above the point of contact so that he is able to accurately judge the line of the ball. At this point the bat can either be stationary and facing straight back down the wicket – known as a block or defensive shot; angled to one side – known as a glance or deflection; or travelling forwards towards the bowler – known as a drive.
Defensive shot[ edit ]
Having taken a long stride, a batsman blocks the ball with a forward defensive shot.
A block stroke is usually a purely defensive stroke designed to stop the ball from hitting the wicket or the batsman's body. This shot has no strength behind it and is usually played with a light or "soft" bottom-hand grip and merely stops the ball moving towards the wicket. A block played on the front foot is known as a forward defensive, while that played on the back foot is known as a backward defensive. The application of these strokes may be used to score runs, by manipulating the block to move the ball into vacant portions of the infield, in which case a block becomes a "push". Pushing the ball is one of the more common ways batsmen manipulate the strike.
Leaving and blocking are employed much more often in first-class cricket (including Test matches ), as there is no requirement to score runs as quickly as possible, thus allowing the batsman to choose which deliveries to play.
Ranjitsinhji playing a leg glance, 1897.
Glance[ edit ]
A leg glance is a delicate straight-batted shot played at a ball aimed slightly on the leg side, using the bat to flick the ball as it passes the batsman, and requiring some wrist work as well, deflecting towards the square leg or fine leg area. The stroke involves deflecting the bat-face towards the leg side at the last moment, head and body moving inside the line of the ball. This shot is played "off the toes, shins or hip". It is played off the front foot if the ball is pitched up at the toes or shin of the batsman, or off the back foot if the ball bounces at waist/hip height to the batsman. Although the equivalent term off glance is not employed within cricket, the concept of angling the bat face towards the offside to deflect the ball away from the wicket for the purpose of scoring runs through the off side is a commonly used technique. This would commonly be described instead as "running (or steering) the ball down to third man".

Drive[ edit ]
A drive is a straight-batted shot, played by swinging the bat in a vertical arc through the line of the ball , hitting the ball in front of the batsman along the ground. It is one of the most common shots in a batsman's armoury and often the first shot taught to junior cricketers. Depending on the direction the ball travels, a drive can be a cover drive (struck towards the cover fielding position), an off drive (towards mid-off), straight drive (straight past the bowler), on drive (between stumps and mid-on) or square drive (towards point). A drive can also be played towards midwicket, although the phrase "midwicket drive" is not in common usage. Drives can be played both off the front and the back foot, but back-foot drives are harder to force through the line of the ball. Although most drives are deliberately struck along the ground to reduce the risk of being dismissed caught, a batsman may decide to play a lofted drive in order to hit the ball over the infielders and potentially even over the boundary for six.

Flick[ edit ]
A flick shot is a straight-batted shot played on the leg side by flicking a full-length delivery using the wrists. It is often also called the clip off the legs. The shot is playing with the bat coming through straight as for the on drive, but the bat face is angled towards the leg side. It can be played both off the front foot or the back foot, either off the toes or from the hips. The shot is played between the mid on and square leg region. Typically played along the ground, the flick can also be played by lofting the ball over the infield.
Horizontal bat shots[ edit ]
The second class of cricket stroke are the horizontal bat shots, also known as cross bat shots. These comprise the cut, the square drive, the pull, the hook and the sweep. Typically horizontal bat shots have a greater probability of failing to make contact with the ball than vertical bat shots, and therefore are restricted to deliveries that are not threatening to hit the stumps, either by dint of being too wide or too short. The bat is swung in a horizontal arc, with the batsman's head typically not being perfectly in line with the ball at point of contact.
A batsman plays a cut off the back foot. Note the balance and weight of the batsman is on his back (right) leg.
Cut[ edit ]
A cut is a cross-batted shot played at a short-pitched ball, placing it wide on the off side. The batsman makes contact with the ball as it draws alongside or passes him and therefore requires virtually no effort on his part as he uses the bowler's pace to divert the ball. A square cut is a shot hit into the off side at near to 90 degrees from the wicket (towards point). A late cut, is played as or after the ball passes the batsman's body and is hit towards third man. The cut shot is typically played off the back foot, but is also sometimes played off the front foot against slower bowling. The cut should be played with the face of the bat rolling over the ball to face the ground thus pushing the ball downwards. A mistimed cut with an open-faced bat (with the face of the bat facing the bowler) will generally lead to the ball rising in the air, giving a chance for the batsman to be caught. Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardena is a master class in late cut.
Square drive[ edit ]
Although confusingly named a drive, the square drive is actually a horizontal bat shot, with identical arm mechanics to that of the square cut. The difference between the cut and the square drive is the height of the ball at contact: the cut is played to a ball bouncing waist high or above with the batsman standing tall, whereas the square drive is played to a wide ball of shin height with the batsman bending his knees and crouching low to make contact.
Ricky Ponting playing a pull shot.
Pull and hook[ edit ]
A pull is a cross-batted shot played to a ball bouncing around waist height by swinging the bat in a horizontal arc in front of the body, pulling it around to the leg side towards mid-wicket or square leg. The term hook shot is used when the shot is played against a ball bouncing at or above chest high to the batsman, the batsman thus "hooking" the ball around behind square leg, either along the ground or in the air. Pull and hook shots can be played off front or back foot, with back foot being more typical.
A left-handed batsman plays a sweep shot.
Sweep[ edit ]
A sweep is a cross-batted front foot shot played to a low bouncing ball, usually from a slow bowler , by kneeling on one knee, bringing the head down in line with the ball and swinging the bat around in a horizontal arc near the pitch as the ball arrives, sweeping it around to the leg side, typically towards square leg or fine leg. A paddle sweep shot is a sweep shot in which the ball is deflected towards fine leg with a stationary or near-stationary bat extended horizontally towards the bowler, whereas the hard sweep shot is played towards square leg with the bat swung firmly in a horizontal arc. Typically the sweep shot will be played to a legside delivery, but it is also possible for a batsman to sweep the ball to the legside from outside off stump. Attempting to sweep a full straight delivery on the stumps is generally not recommended because of the risk of lbw .
Unorthodox strokeplay[ edit ]
Since a batsman is free to play any shot to any type of delivery as he wishes, the above list is by no means a complete list of the strokes that batsmen choose to play. Many unorthodox, typically high-risk, shots have been used throughout the history of the game. The advent of limited overs cricket has seen the increased use of unorthodox shots to hit the ball into gaps where there are no fielders placed. Unorthodox shots are rarely used in first-class cricket as the pace of the game is slower and it is relatively more important to keep one's wicket than to try to score runs off every ball.
A few unorthodox shots have gained enough popularity or notoriety to have been given their own names and entered common usage.
Reverse sweep[ edit ]
A reverse sweep is a cross-batted sweep shot played in the opposite direction to the standard sweep, thus instead of sweeping the ball to the leg side, it is swept to the off side, towards backward point or third man. The batsman may also swap his hands on the bat handle to make the stroke easier to execute. The batsman may also bring his back foot to the front therefore making it more like a traditional sweep. The advantage of a reverse sweep is that it effectively reverses the fielding positions and thus is very difficult to set a field to.
It was first regularly played in the 1970s by the Pakistani batsman Mushtaq Mohammad , though Mushtaq's brother Hanif Mohammad is sometimes credited as the inventor. Cricket coach Bob Woolmer has been credited with popularising the stroke. [4] [5]
The most famous example of a reverse sweep backfiring was in the case of Mike Gatting of England against Allan Border of Australia in the 1987 Cricket World Cup final. With England on course for victory Gatting attempted a reverse sweep off the first delivery bowled by Border, top- edged the ball and was caught by wicket-keeper Greg Dyer . England subsequently lost momentum and eventually lost the match.
Because of the unorthodox nature of hand and body position, it is often difficult to get a lot of power behind a reverse sweep; in many situations, the intention is to glance or cut the ball to the backward leg area. However, in rare occasions, players have been able to execute reverse sweeps for a six. Kevin Pietersen , who pioneered switch hitting is adept at this, but one could argue that the resulting shot is basically a sweep rather than a reverse sweep. A more 'classic example' of such a shot would be Yusuf Pathan 's six off Robin Peterson . [6]
Slog and slog sweep[ edit ]
A slog is a powerful pull shot played over mid-wicket, usually hit in the air in an attempt to score a six . A shot would be described as a slog when it is typically played at a delivery that would not ordinarily be pulled. A slog can also be described as hitting the ball to "cow corner". This phrase is designed to imply that the batsman is unsophisticated in his strokeplay and technique by suggesting he would be more at home playing on more rudimentary cricket fields in which there may be cows grazing along the boundary edge. The slog can be an effective shot because all the batsman's power and body weight can be put into swinging the bat at the ball.
A slog sweep is a slog played from the kneeling position used to sweep. Slog sweeps are usually directed over square-leg rather than to mid-wicket. It is almost exclusively used against reasonably full-pitched balls from slow bowlers, as only then does the batsman have time to sight the length and adopt the kneeling position required for the slog sweep. The front leg of the shoto make a quorum . 23 people attended the meeting, out of whom 17 voted against Modi. Only one vote in Modi's support was counted: five other votes were discarded as disputed. 12 more of Modi's supporters were denied entry into the meeting, on the ground that they were late by 10 minutes. The delay occurred because their vehicles were stopped, and they were beaten with rods by a mob. 5 more voters were discarded as disputed. In the end, Modi was ousted as the President by a controversial 17-1 vote. Pathan denied any role in the attack on Modi's supporters, and suggested that the attack was staged by them as an excuse for their pending defeat. [45]
"Modigate"[ edit ]
In March 2010, while Modi was in London, the Congress-led Indian Government revoked his passport. Modi challenged the decision in the Delhi High Court, and BJP leader Sushma Swaraj 's daughter Bansuri Swaraj was one of the nine lawyers who represented him. [21] In 2014, BJP won the Indian general elections and formed government at the Centre. Meanwhile, the High Court restored Modi's passport in August 2014. [46] In June 2015, British Member of Parliament Keith Vaz was reported to the parliamentary standards commissioner for lobbying UK immigration officials on behalf of Lalit Modi. It was revealed that Vaz had mentioned a recommendation from Sushma Swaraj (then an opposition leader) in his correspondence with the immigration officials. Modi's wife Minal was diagnosed with breast cancer during 2008-09, and was being treated in Portugal . In 2014, when requested by British Authorities, Sushma Swaraj requested the British authorities to go by law of the land. British authorities provided Modi travel documents to attend to his ailing wife in Portugal. [47]
Modi also revealed that on 25 August 2011, BJP leader Vasundhara Raje (also an opposition leader at that time) signed a document supporting his application to the British authorities. The application, which was never presented to the British authorities, had a secrecy clause that it should not be revealed to the Indian authorities. [48] In her affidavit, Raje had claimed that Modi was a victim of a "political witch hunt" by the Congress. [49] Earlier, in 2013, a Jaipur-based lawyer Poonam Chand Bhandari had filed a public interest litigation in the Delhi high court, claiming that Lalit Modi had transferred millions of rupees to a company owned by Vasundhara Raje and her son Dushyant Singh , using a shell company . [50] Dushyant Singh owns Niyant Heritage Hotels Private Limited (NHHPL), and his mother Vasundhara Raje holds 3,280 shares in the company. [51] In 2008, Lalit Modi's company Anand Heritage Hotels Private Limited (AHHPL) provided an unsecured loan of ₹ 38 million to NHHPL. During 2008-09, AHHPL acquired 815 shares in NHHPL, paying ₹ 96,000 for each share, although the face value of each share was only ₹ 10. NHHPL, which previously had a paid up capital of ₹ 1 million, thus received a total of 116.3 million from AHHPL. [52] [53] In June 2015, the Congress accused Vasundhara Raje of corruption, alleging that she had granted favours to Lalit Modi in exchange for the money. BJP argued that Raje had acted as a friend of Modi, and not in her capacity as a political leader. [54]
The controversy resulting from these revealations was termed as "Modigate" by the Indian media. The opposition parties accused the BJP leaders of shielding Lalit Modi, who was wanted in several cases of financial irregularities in India. [55] [56] Modi's lawyer Mehmood Abdi called the controversy a matter of political vendetta, and claimed that he had been hounded by the Congress ever since the Shashi Tharoor-Sunanda Pushkar controversy of 2010. [57]
As a result, Interpol, the international law enforcement agency, issued a light blue notice against Modi to be arrested on Indian soil. However, in June 2015, and despite the Interpol notice, Modi took a picture with ex-Interpol Chief Ronald Noble and uploaded it to his Instagram account while attending the El Clasico match in Barcelona. In the post, he referred to Noble as his “brother”. The incident caused significant media backlash within India as many began to raise questions about the connection between men with criminal reputations like Modi and international law enforcement. Yet Noble, who served as the head of Interpol from 2000 to 2014, denied any knowledge of Modi's criminal activities despite evidence that Modi was on an Interpol watch list for some time. [58]
One month later, a series of emails revealed Modi's further ties with Noble and his brother James. Indian media released a set of emails exchanged between the three men between January 21-26, 2014, discussing a property worth $365,000 in the United States. Ronald Noble explained that his brother and Modi entered into a joint business venture around the property, under which Modi would purchase the house, while James Noble would maintain it at his own expense. Modi and James Noble would split the profits equally once the property was sold.
"There never could have been a conflict of interest," Noble emphasized. "My brother has never had anything to do with Interpol and that Modi was never of interest to Interpol." [59]
As of 2015, Lalit Modi has not been convicted of any charges as part of the ED investigation. [60]
Awards and recognitions[ edit ]

On 28 December 2009, Business Standard named Lalit Modi as one of the ‘Game Changers of the Decade’ [70]
In February 2010, Sports Illustrated named Lalit Modi as the 2nd Most Powerful Person in Indian Sports [71]



Points system[ edit ]
After each match, the two on-field umpires, and the third umpire, scores the performance of both the teams. A team can be awarded a total of ten points per match, out of which four points are given on the basis of how the team has adhered to the "spirit of the game" in the opinion of the umpires. The other three criteria are based on the respect towards to the opposition, the laws of cricket and the umpires. Each of these three criteria represents 2 points. If a team has got two points in the criterion, its performance is considered as "good", whereas getting one or zero points indicates that its performance is "average" or "bad" respectively. [1]
Winners[ edit ]
The Chennai Super Kings has received the award six times in the 2008 , 2010 , 2011 , 2013 , 2014 and 2015 Indian Premier League seasons. [2] The Kings XI Punjab won the award in the 2009 season, [3] whereas the Rajasthan Royals won it in the 2012 season. [4]

Main article: Physical therapy education
Educational criteria for physical therapy providers vary from state to state and from country to country, and among various levels of professional responsibility. Most U.S. states have physical therapy practice acts that recognize both physical therapists (PT) and physical therapist assistants (PTA) and some jurisdictions also recognize physical therapy technicians (PT Techs) or aides. Most countries have licensing bodies that require physical therapists to be a member of before they can start practising as independent professionals.
Physical therapists[ edit ]
The primary physical therapy practitioner is the Physical Therapist (PT) who is trained and licensed to examine, evaluate, diagnose and treat impairment, functional limitations and disabilities in patients or clients. Currently, most Physical Therapist education curricula in the United States culminate in a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree, [27] but many currently practising PTs hold a Master of Physical Therapy degree and some hold a Bachelor's degree . The World Confederation of Physical Therapy (WCPT) recognizes there is considerable diversity in the social, economic, cultural, and political environments in which physical therapist education is conducted throughout the world. WCPT recommends physical therapist entry-level educational programs be based on university or university-level studies, of a minimum of four years, independently validated and accredited as being at a standard that accords graduates full statutory and professional recognition. [2] WCPT acknowledges there is innovation and variation in program delivery and in entry-level qualifications, including first university degrees (Bachelors/Baccalaureate/Licensed or equivalent), Masters and Doctorate entry qualifications. What is expected is that any program should deliver a curriculum that will enable physical therapists to attain the knowledge, skills, and attributes described in these guidelines. Professional education prepares physical therapists to be autonomous practitioners, that may work in collaboration with other members of the health care team.[ citation needed ] Curricula in the United States are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE). As of 2011, APTA reports that 222 out of 227 entry-level professional degree programs accredited in the United States are at the doctoral level. [27] According to CAPTE, as of 2012 there are 25,660 students currently enrolled in 210 accredited PT programs in the United States . [28]
The physical therapist professional curriculum is rigorous and includes content and learning experiences in the clinical sciences (e.g., content about the cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, metabolic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, integumentary, musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular systems and the medical and surgical conditions frequently seen by physical therapists).
Curricula for the Physical Therapist professional degree include:
Screening to determine when patients/clients need further examination or consultation by a physical therapist or referral to another health care professional.
Examination: Examine patients/clients by obtaining a history from them and from other sources. Examine patients/clients by performing systems reviews. Examine patients/clients by selecting and administering culturally appropriate and age related tests and measures. Tests and measures include, but are not limited to, those that assess: a.

Canada[ edit ]
Canadian Physiotherapy programs are offered at 15 Universities, often through the university's respective college of medicine. In the past decade, each of Canada's physical therapy schools has transitioned from 3-year Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy (BScPT) programs that required 2 years of pre-requisites university courses (5-year bachelor's degree) to 2-year Master's of Physical Therapy (MPT) programs that require pre-requisite bachelor's degrees. The last Canadian university to follow suit was the University of Manitoba who transitioned to the MPT program in 2012, making the MPT credential the new entry to practice standard across Canada. Existing practitioners with BScPT credentials are not required to upgrade their qualifications.
In the province of Quebec, prospective physiotherapists are required to have completed a college diploma in either health sciences, which lasts on average two years, or physical rehabilitation technology, which lasts at least three years, to apply to a physiotherapy program or program in university. Following admission, physical therapy students work on a bachelor of science with a major in physical therapy and rehabilitation. The B.Sc. usually requires three years to complete. Students must then enter graduate school to complete a master's degree in physical therapy, which normally requires one and a half to two years of study. Graduates who obtain their M.Sc. must successfully pass the membership examination to become member of the Ordre professionnel de la physiothérapie du Québec (OPPQ). Physiotherapists can pursue their education in such fields as rehabilitation sciences, sports medicine, kinesiology, and physiology.
To date, there are no bridging programs available to facilitate upgrading from the BScPT to the MPT credential. However, research Master's of Science (MSc) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs are available at every university. Aside from academic research, practitioners can upgrade their skills and qualifications through continuing education courses and curriculums. Continuing education is a requirement of the provincial regulatory bodies.
The Canadian Alliance of Physiotherapy Regulators (CAPR), or simply known as The Alliance, offers eligible program graduates to apply for the national Physiotherapy Competency Examination (PCE). Passing the PCE is one of the requirements in most provinces and territories to work as a licensed physiotherapist in Canada. [29] The Alliance has members which are physiotherapy regulatory organizations recognized in their respective provinces and territories:
Government of Yukon, Consumer Services
College of Physical Therapists of British Columbia
Physiotherapy Alberta College + Association
Saskatchewan College of Physical Therapists
College of Physiotherapists of Manitoba
College of Physiotherapists of Ontario
Ordre professionnel de la physiothérapie du Québec
College of Physiotherapists of New Brunswick/Collège des physiothérapeutes du Nouveau-Brunswick
Nova Scotia College of Physiotherapists
Prince Edward Island College of Physiotherapists
Newfoundland & Labrador College of Physiotherapists [30]
The Canadian Physiotherapy Association offers a curriculum of continuing education courses in orthopaedics and manual therapy. The program consists of 5 levels (7 courses) of training with ongoing mentorship and evaluation at each level. The orthopaedic curriculum and examinations takes a minimum of 4 years to complete. However, upon completion of level 2, physiotherapists can apply to a unique 1-year course-based Master's program in advanced orthopaedics and manipulation at the University of Western Ontario to complete their training. This program accepts only 16 physiotherapists annually since 2007. Successful completion of either of these education streams and their respective examinations allows physiotherapists the opportunity to apply to the Canadian Academy of Manipulative Physiotherapy (CAMPT) for fellowship. Fellows of the Canadian Academy of manipulative Physiotherapists (FCAMPT) are considered leaders in the field, having extensive post-graduate education in orthopaedics and manual therapy. FCAMPT is an internationally recognized credential, as CAMPT is a member of the International Federation of Manipulative Physiotherapists (IFOMPT), a branch of the World Confederation of Physical Therapy (WCPT) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Physical therapist assistants[ edit ]
Physical therapist assistants may deliver treatment and physical interventions for patients and clients under a care plan established by and under the supervision of a physical therapist. Physical therapist assistants in the United States are currently trained under associate of applied sciences curricula specific to the profession, as outlined and accredited by CAPTE. As of August 2011, there were 276 accredited two-year ( Associate degree ) programs for physical therapist assistants In the United States of America. [31] According to CAPTE, as of 2012 there are 10,598 students currently enrolled in 280 accredited PTA programs in the United States. [28]

De wicketkeeper, die hier vlak achter het wicket staat.
Cricket wicket-keeping handschoenen
De wicketkeeper is de speler in het cricket die achter de batsman en het wicket staat, waarop gebowld wordt.
De taak van de wicketkeeper is in grote lijnen hetzelfde als die van de catcher (of achtervanger ) bij honkbal . De wicketkeeper is de enige speler van de fieldende partij, die handschoenen en beenbeschermers mag dragen.
De belangrijkste taak van de wicketkeeper is het tegenhouden van de ballen die door de batsman niet worden weggeslagen, zodat de batsmen geen runs kunnen maken. Een andere belangrijke taak is ballen te vangen die door het bat slechts worden geschampt (dus wel geraakt), om daarmee de batsman uit te krijgen.



History[ edit ]
Fairfax Media building at Pyrmont, NSW
John Fairfax purchased The Sydney Morning Herald in 1841. [5] Several generations of the Fairfax family continued to control the company.
Fairfax Media was founded by the Fairfax family as John Fairfax and Sons, later to become John Fairfax Holdings. The Fairfax family lost control of the company in December 1990. It was renamed from John Fairfax Holdings to Fairfax Media in 2007.
1950s to 1999[ edit ]
The Australian Financial Review was founded in 1951. In that decade, Fairfax started two television stations, ATN and QTQ . Fairfax began expanding in the 1960s, acquiring, among others, The Age , The Newcastle Herald and the Illawarra Mercury . In 1979, Rupert Murdoch attempted to take over rival The Herald and Weekly Times . Due to the costs of defending the takeover, Fairfax sold its television properties, including the Seven Network . In 1988, Fairfax sold its magazines (including Woman's Day , People , Dolly , and Good Housekeeping ) to Australian Consolidated Press , and discontinued its Sydney afternoon tabloid The Sun , transferring some of its content and the sponsorship of the City to Surf to its new Sunday tabloid The Sun-Herald which also replaced the broadsheet Sunday Herald.
In 1987, Warwick Fairfax , then aged 26, controversially bought out his family's holdings in the company by borrowing heavily. He successfully took it over; but, on 10 December 1990, the company collapsed and a receiver was appointed, [6] with company debts of A$1.7 billion. [5] By 1993, the company was re-listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and the two biggest shareholders of John Fairfax Holdings were the Canadian newspaper magnate Conrad Black and his Hollinger Group with 25%, and the Australian media mogul, Kerry Packer and his publicly listed company, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited with 15%. Due to Australian government concerns over media consolidation that limited any single foreign shareholder holding more than 25% interest in national and metropolitan newspapers, [7] after intense lobbying for the right to increase his stake, Black conceded defeat in 1996, [8] [9] [10] selling his holding to the New Zealand corporate "raider" Brierley Investments , that was ultimately subject to the same restrictions. [6]
2000 to 2009[ edit ]
In April 2003, Fairfax acquired the publishing assets of New Zealand's Independent Newspapers Limited ( News Corp Australia ), including many of New Zealand's highest-profile newspapers. In July 2005, Fairfax acquired the RSVP dating site for A$38 million. [11] In August 2005, Fairfax's general classifieds site created in March 2004, Cracker.com.au consistently exceeded 500,000 unique visitors a month.[ citation needed ] In December 2005, Fairfax acquired Stayz Pty Ltd [12] for A$12.7 million. [13] This investment proved to be very successful as Stayz was sold on 27 November 2013, for $220 million, far exceeding its estimated net debt of $154 million. [13]
In August 2005, Fairfax ended its 16-month search for a new chief executive officer with David Kirk , a former Rugby Union World Cup winning captain of the New Zealand All Blacks being appointed to replace departing CEO Fred Hilmer . David Kirk got the job ahead of Fairfax COO Brian Evans (former head of Fairfax New Zealand) and Doug Flynn , who took the top job at UK Pest control company Rentokil after negotiations with Fairfax broke off. In March 2006, Fairfax acquired New Zealand auction website Trademe.co.nz for NZ$700 million.[ citation needed ] On 4 March 2006, it was announced that Fairfax would purchase The Border Mail newspaper in Albury-Wodonga for A$162 million. In October 2006, speculation began to grow that the company would be bought out and split up after the passage of changes to Australian media laws. Rival media company News Corp Australia purchased a 7.5 per cent stake in the company at this time, with the stated aim of keeping Fairfax in one piece.[ citation needed ]
On 7 December 2006, John Fairfax Holdings and Rural Press announced the beginning of their merger proceedings. Once merged, the new entity formed a publishing company worth A$9 billion and resulted in regaining control of The Canberra Times (which it owned in the 1980s), and through John B. Fairfax of Rural Press, saw the return of the Fairfax family to the company board. The company also gained a number of other regional newspapers, radio stations and websites; plus agricultural publications in various countries.[ citation needed ] On 12 January 2007, John Fairfax Holdings changed its name to Fairfax Media. [14]
On 7 March 2007, Fairfax Media announced a new website for Brisbane, called the Brisbane Times . The website initially employed 14 journalists and was an attempt by Fairfax to break into the South East Queensland market.[ citation needed ] On 20 March 2007 Fairfax Media launched a new business website, BusinessDay.com.au that aggregated feeds from the other news vehicles in the Fairfax stable as well as "from the world's most respected news sources". It featured breaking news updated "every 15 minutes".[ citation needed ] Also in 2007 Fairfax Media bought the radio assets of Southern Cross Broadcasting . Macquarie Media Group purchased Southern Cross for A$1.35 billion and onsold these assets to the Fairfax Group. [15]
On 26 August 2007, Kirk and Deputy CEO Brian McCarthy announced that 550 staff would be cut as part of a "business improvement" programme. The staff reductions would take place in both Australia and New Zealand, with the latter country bearing the brunt of the cuts, with 160 full-time employees losing their jobs. [16] On 5 December, David Kirk tendered his resignation, and on 10 December Brian McCarthy (former Rural Press CEO) was appointed as CEO. A new campaign, "Fair Go, Fairfax: Don't discount journalism", [17] was launched by the MEAA [ citation needed ] in protest to the cuts arguing that the jobs losses will affect "quality journalism".
As of May 2008 Fairfax Media had a market capitalisation of over A$5 billion.[5] The number of printed edition readers has fallen since at least 2006 and the group's stock price has declined by more than 60 percent since 2007, to less than A$2 billion by September 2011, and by 85 percent at June 2012.[6]
On 11 July 2007, Fairfax Media acquired the former radio assets of Southern Cross Broadcasting (on-sold from Macquarie Media Group's purchase of SCB): 2UE Sydney, 3AW and Magic 1278 Melbourne, 4BC and 4BH Brisbane, and 6PR and 96fm Perth. Graham Mott will continue in his role as general manager of the broadcast radio group under Fairfax. Mott indicated at the time of the acquisition that national syndication of programming (such as that of the since-retired John Laws ) would largely be replaced on the network with more localised syndication at a state level. [18]
Fairfax also acquired Satellite Music Australia (SMA) as part of the SCB deal, who provide music channels to retailers, as well as Foxtel and Austar [19] (where it is branded AIR). MyTalk Datacasting Channel was officially purchased from Southern Cross Broadcasting on 5 November 2007, [20] and ceased broadcasting on 25 February 2008.
2010 to present[ edit ]
In late 2011, John B. Fairfax and his family investment company, Marinya Media, sold their remaining 9.7 percent stake in Fairfax Media for A$189 million. The sale came after an earlier dispute between John B. Fairfax and Ron Walker , Chairman of the Board of Fairfax Media, which led to the very public departure of Walker. Continued poor performance of Fairfax Media in light of changing news services was cited as one of the reasons for the sale of Marinya Media's interests in Fairfax. John B. Fairfax had earlier stood down from the Fairfax board, and his son, Nick Fairfax, was reported to be discussing his future with the rest of the company board. [21] [22] [23] [24]
In 2012 mining billionaire Gina Rinehart (the wealthiest person in Australia) became Fairfax's biggest shareholder, purchasing a 14 percent stake in the company. Rinehart also sought a position on the Fairfax board. [25] By June 2012, Rinehart had increased her stake in Fairfax Media to 18.67 percent, and was believed to seek three board seats and involvement in editorial decisions. [26] There were reports that Rinehart sought to increase her total share to 19.99%, the maximum allowed before a takeover offer must be made. But provisions in Fairfax Media's insurance policy denied cover for directors owning more than 15%, so Rinehart had to sell down to 14.99%. Rinehart was denied a place on the board because she would not agree to Fairfax's charter of independence, and sold her stake in 2015.
On 18 June 2012, as part of evolving to a sustainable model for its news media business, Fairfax Media announced it would cut 1,900 staff and begin to erect digital paywalls around its two main metropolitan news brands, the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. It also announced it was shifting to "compact" or tabloid-sized editions of the broadsheet newspapers from March 2013, and that its two printing facilities at Chullora and Tullamarine would close. The changes, prompted by shrinking advertising revenue, were expected to generate A$235 million in annual savings over three years.
In 2012, Fairfax Media acquired Netus Pty Ltd, a technology investment company which owned 85% of Allure Media, and purchased the remaining 15% from minority shareholders. Allure Media own a range of websites, including the Australian licenses for Lifehacker, Gizmodo, and Kotaku.
In December 2014, Fairfax merged with Macquarie Radio Network . Under the deal, Fairfax gained a 55% share in Macquarie. A party may hold only two radio licences in each market, so some stations including 2CH and the Macquarie Regional Radio network were sold. [27] In turn, 96FM Perth was sold to Australian Radio Network . [28] [29] The merger was completed in March 2015. [30] [31]
In 2014, Fairfax Media founded online streaming company Stan with Nine Entertainment Co. , investing AU$50 million into the joint venture.
In 2015, Fairfax created a partnership with Huffington Post to launch HuffPost Australia.

How runs are scored and teams win a match.
In the sport of cricket , a run is the basic unit of scoring . Runs are scored by a batsman , and the aggregate of the scores of a team's batsmen (plus any extras ) constitutes the team's score.
A batsman scoring 50 (a 'half century') or 100 runs (a ' century ', 'hundred' or 'ton'), or any higher multiple of 50 runs, is considered a particular achievement. By extension, a partnership of two batsmen moving the team score on by a multiple of 50 runs, or the team score passing a multiple of 50 runs, is also cause for celebration.
Rules[ edit ]
The rules concerning the scoring of runs are mostly contained in Law 18 of the Laws of cricket . [1] The simplest way for a batsman to score a run is by the striker hitting the ball such that both batsmen can run from one end of the pitch to the other without either batsman getting out: the batsmen effectively exchanging positions, so the striking batsman becomes the non-striker, and vice versa. The batsmen may be able to run up and down the pitch more than once, crossing each time, to score two, three or more runs. A batsman can also score four or six runs by hitting the ball to or over the boundary (four if it strikes the ground before the boundary; six if it crosses the boundary in the air without striking the ground), and may be awarded five penalty runs in certain situations. A batsman is never compelled to run (cricket has no equivalent of baseball 's force out ).
Thus, according to Law 18, a run is scored when:
the batsmen, or their runner , at any time while the ball is in play, have crossed and made good their ground from end to end;
a boundary is scored;
" lost ball " is called.
Runs are added to the team score, but not the score of an individual batsman, for extras ( no balls , wides , byes and leg byes ).
Short runs[ edit ]
To score a run, each batsman must run from the popping crease at one end to the popping crease at the other end. A run is "short" if one of the running batsmen fails to make good his ground on turning for a further run (that is, the batsman fails to complete the run by putting some part of his body or his bat on the ground behind the popping crease) – in this event, the number of runs achieved is decreased by the number of "short" runs. Although a short run also shortens the next run, since the second run starts somewhat closer to the destination than it should, the second run is not regarded as "short" if it is completed. A batsman taking up his batting stance in front of his crease may also run from that point without penalty.
If either umpire considers that either or both batsmen deliberately run short, the umpire can give a warning to the batsman that this is unfair and disallow any earned runs from that delivery. If an umpire considers that any batsman deliberately runs short again in that innings , a 5-run penalty is conceded to the bowling side. In practice, this rule is rarely invoked. Also, if either of the batsmen is not in possession of their bat, the run is called short.



Domestic career[ edit ]
Rahul made his debut in the 2010-11 season, playing first-class cricket for Karnataka . He made his debut in Indian Premier League in 2014, playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad . [1]
Playing for South Zone in the final of the 2014–15 Duleep Trophy against Central Zone, Rahul scored 185 off 233 balls in the first innings and 130 off 152 balls in the second. Although his contribution went in vain with S the nine matches he played.
International career[ edit ]
After an excellent domestic season in 2014, Rahul was picked in the Indian Test squad for the Australian tour . He made his Test Debut in the Boxing Day Test Match beginning on 26 December 2014 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . He replaced Rohit Sharma and was handed over the Test cap by MS Dhoni . He come to bat at no. 6 and made 3 runs in the first inning. In the second inning he played at no. 3 and made only 1 run. He retained his place for the fourth test played at Sydney Cricket Ground . He open the inning with Murali Vijay and made 110 runs, his maiden International hundred.
He was a part of 15-man squad for the tour of Bangladesh in June 2015 but later withdrew due to dengue fever. He then made a comeback into the Test team in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour after Murali Vijay was ruled out due to a hamstring injury. But he did not show any progress in the first match where he got out early in both innings for less than 10 runs. In the second match of the series, Shikhar Dhawan lost his place due to injury and ruled out from the rest of the tour. So, Rahul got a chance to show his talents once again where he made his second Test century of 108 runs from 190 balls inculding 14 fours and 1 six. India finally went on to win the match to level the series and Rahul named as the man of the match. His wicket keeping skills came in handy, when saha got injured, Rahul took a spectacular catch to dismiss Mathews in the second innings, who was doing well throughout the series hence his catch proved to be game changing. [2]
Personal life[ edit ]
Rahul hails from Mangalore . Rahul's father, KN Lokesh, who is originally from Kannur village in Magadi taluk in Ramanagara district , is a professor of Civil Engineering at the NITK , Mangalore . His mother, Rajeshwari, is an associate professor at Mangalore University ’s undergraduate college. [3]
Rahul's father, who was a big fan of Sunil Gavaskar , wanted to name him after Gavaskar's son but mistook the name of Gavaskar's son 'Rohan' as 'Rahul'. [4]

Simmons is capable of large scores; with three first class double-centuries to his name, but at the same time he has been prone to inconsistency. His career best of 282, in a first-class match for West Indies A against a touring England XI in January 2009, heralded his Test debut in the final Test of that tour . Simmons scored 24 and 8 as the West Indies secured a series-clinching draw at the Queen's Park Oval , Trinidad. [1] Simmons was retained for the following West Indian tour of England , but has played no further Tests.
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
In April 2014 it was announced that Simmons had been signed by Indian Premier League side Mumbai Indians , replacing Jalaj Saxena . This had the aim of improving the team's fortunes, after they had gone without a win in any of their 4 matches prior to his signing. On 22 May 2014, Simmons scored his maiden IPL century helping his team post a 7 wickets win over Kings XI Punjab . [2]
In August 2014, Simmons was travelling in the USA between games for Guyana Amazon Warriors in the Caribbean Premier League when his bat attracted the attention of US customs officials, who apparently believed that it was being used to smuggle illegal drugs. As a consequence, they drilled several holes into the bat. [3]
Simmons was selected for Mumbai Indians for play 2014 IPL and 2015 IPL seasons. He opened the batting with Indian Parthiv Patel during the 2015 season due to injury of Aaron Finch , where they became the most dangerous opening pair of the IPL 8 with an average over 50. Simmons played a major role in the team guided to the IPL 8 win by Mumbai Indians. It was their second title in IPL. [4] [5]
International career[ edit ]
Simmons made his Test debut against England on 6 March 2006 and ODI debut against Pakistan in 7 December 2006. Hs has score two ODI centuries. Though he is very good at in ODI and T20I arena, Simmons has failed in Test cricket, where his highest score is 49 runs against Pakistan. He scored his maiden century in ODIs by scoring 122 against Bangladesh at Shere Bangla National Stadium , Dhaka .

Early life[ edit ]
Wisden was born in Crown Street, Brighton . [3] His father, William, was a builder. [3] He attended Brighton's Middle Street School (formerly the Royal Union School, founded as a charity school in 1805). [3] He moved to London after his father died, and lived with the wicket-keeper Tom Box . [4] [5]
Cricket[ edit ]
In July 1845, aged 18, only 5  ft  6  in and weighing just 7 stone (44 kg), [5] he made his first-class debut for Sussex against MCC, taking 6 wickets in the first innings and three in the second. [6] He joined the All-England Eleven in 1846, moving allegiance to the United All-England Eleven in 1852. [3] He was engaged to marry George Parr 's sister Annie in 1849, but she died before the wedding, and he never married. [3]
Initially a fast roundarm bowler , before overarm bowling was permitted, his pace slowed in later years so he bowled medium pace; he also bowled slow underarm . While bowling fast, he took on average nearly 10 wickets in each game. [4] In 1850, playing for the South against the North at Lord's , his off-cutter technique won him 10 wickets in the second innings, all clean bowled (still the only instance of all ten wickets being taken "bowled" in any first-class match). [4] He was also a competent batsman, and scored two first-class centuries, the first, exactly 100, against Kent at Tunbridge Wells in 1849, and in 1855 he notched up 148 against Yorkshire, the only first-class century scored in 1855. [4]
He played almost all of his cricket in England, mostly for Sussex, but once for Kent and thrice for Middlesex. [3] He travelled with a touring team led by George Parr to Canada and the US in 1859, where eight matches in Montreal , Hoboken , Philadelphia , Hamilton and Rochester were won easily. [5]
Of moderate height, he was nicknamed the "Little Wonder" after the winner of the Epsom Derby in 1840, and later the "Cardinal". [3] He was said to be the best all-rounder of his day. [4] In all, he took 1,109 first-class wickets with a bowling average of 10.32. He scored 4,140 first-class runs with a batting average of 14.12, an average which was very good for the time. [1] [4]
Business career and legacy[ edit ]
Wisden began a cricket-equipment business in Leamington Spa in 1850 and five years later opened a "cricket and cigar" shop in Coventry Street near The Haymarket in central London, in partnership with Fred Lillywhite until 1858. [5] [3] He was also the cricket coach at Harrow School from 1852 to 1855, and owned The Cricketers, a public house at Duncton in Sussex. [3]
He retired from cricket in 1863 at the relatively early age of 37 as a result of rheumatism, [5] and started publishing his annual Cricketers' Almanack the following year. [4] He also published in Cricket and How to Play It in 1866. [3] In retirement he developed his business into a manufacturer and retailer of equipment for many sports, not just cricket. The shop moved to Cranbourn Street near Leicester Square in 1872. [5]
After his death the business grew into a major international sports brand, receiving a Royal Warrant in 1911 as "Athletic Outfitters to the King". [5] The business went into receivership in 1939, and was acquired in 1943 by a Co-operative society , which sold it on to Grays of Cambridge in 1970.[ citation needed ] Grays then ceased to use Wisden as an equipment brand, but re-established John Wisden & Co as the publisher of the Cricketers' Almanack. It is now an imprint of Wisden's owner, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc .[ citation needed ]
Death[ edit ]
Wisden died of cancer, at the age of 57, in the flat above his Cranbourn Street shop (next to Leicester Square tube station ). He was buried in Brompton Cemetery , London. [3]
In 1913, 29 years after his death, he was the subject of a "Special Portrait" in the 50th edition of Wisden, replacing the usual Wisden Cricketers of the Year feature which was dropped from that edition.[ citation needed ] In 1984, a headstone was placed at his grave to mark the centenary of his death.[ citation needed ]

Overview[ edit ]
Traditionally, cricket matches have two umpires on the field, one standing at the end where the bowler delivers the ball (Bowler's end), and one directly opposite the facing batsman (usually, but not always, at square leg ). However, in the modern game, there may be more than two umpires; for example Test Matches have four: two on-field umpires, a third umpire who has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire who looks after the match balls, takes out the drinks for the on-field umpires, and also arranges travel and meals for all of the umpires.
Since 2002, the ICC has two panels of umpires: namely the Elite Panel of Umpires (two of which are, in theory, appointed to each Test Match) and the larger International Panel of Umpires .
Professional matches also have a match referee , who complements the role of the umpires. The match referee makes no decisions relevant to the outcome of the game, but instead enforces the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct , ensuring the game is played in a reputable manner. The ICC appoints a match referee from its Elite Panel of Referees to adjudicate Test matches and One Day Internationals .
Minor cricket matches will often have trained umpires. The independent Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers (ACU&S), formed in 1955, used to conduct umpire training within the UK. It however merged to form the ECB Association of Cricket Officials (ECB ACO) on 1 January 2008. A new structure of cricket umpiring and scoring qualifications has now been put into place and the ACO provides training and examinations for these. [1] Cricket Australia has introduced a two-tier accreditation scheme and eventually all umpires will be required to achieve the appropriate level of accreditation. The ages of umpires can vary enormously as some are former players, while others enter the cricketing world as umpires. Physical disability need not necessarily be a barrier – in Victoria a 19-year-old with cerebral palsy has achieved the national Level 2 accreditation, is umpiring in a country competition, has umpired a statewide carnival, and has been recognised for his achievement by Cricket Victoria . The youngest umpire to achieve Level 2 Accreditation was a 15-year-old male West Australian in 2009.
Nevertheless, in accordance with the tradition of cricket, most ordinary, local games will have two umpires, one supplied by each side, who will fairly enforce the accepted rules.
Positions[ edit ]
The cricket umpire lever counter, an example of a device used by umpires to count the number of balls in an over
When a ball is being bowled, one umpire (the bowler's end umpire) stands behind the stumps at the non-striker's end (that is, the end from which the ball is being bowled), which gives him a view straight down the pitch.
The second (the striker's end umpire) takes the position that he feels gives him the best view of the play. Through long tradition, this is usually square leg – in line with the popping crease and a few yards to the batsman's leg side – hence he is sometimes known as the square leg umpire.
However, if a fielder takes up position at square leg or somewhere so as to block his view, or if there is an injured batsman with a runner, then the umpire must move somewhere else – typically either a short distance or to point on the opposite side of the batsman. If the square-leg umpire elects to stand at point, he is required to inform both the batsmen, the captain of the fielding team, and his colleague. He may also move to the point position later in tEarly life[ edit ]
Singh was born in Chandigarh in Punjab , India . He has always been a fast bowler and has compromised his accuracy for extra pace. He debuted for the Punjab in the 2003/04 Ranji Trophy season and continues to play first class cricket for the Punjab. According to former coach of Punjab, Bhupinder Singh Senior, "All he wants to do is bowl fast, nothing else matters to him". [2] He played for India in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2004 but disappointed with the ball, going for an expensive 44 runs in five overs in his only match. He later received the Border-Gavaskar scholarship which allowed him to train in cricket academies in Australia . [3] His fellow scholarship holder, R. P. Singh , also later went on to play for India.
Domestic career[ edit ]
Singh began his domestic career with the Punjab cricket team in the Limited Overs version of the Ranji Trophy. He played only one match and went wicketless. However, when he made his debut for Punjab in the first class version of the Trophy, he averaged 21.00 over his 6 matches and took 30 wickets. [4] However, he was still unimpressive in ODIs, averaging 109.00 over 4 matches. [5] Despite this, he was selected for the Indian ODI squad against Sri Lanka after playing only 5 ODIs for his state, but was sent back to the domestic circuit after failing a fitness test. [6] He improved his performance in the 2005-06 ODI Ranji Trophy season, averaging 20.75 over his 4 matches, which included a 4 wicket haul. [7]
Singh impressed many in the Challenger Trophy with his pace, which was the quickest of the tournament. He played for India A and while he picked up few wickets, he was referred to as the "fastest bowler in India" by VVS Laxman and "the quickest around at present" by Javagal Srinath . [8] He also impressed West Indian pace bowling great Ian Bishop , who believed he was improving with every game and developing into a good fast bowling prospect for India. [9]
International career[ edit ]
Singh was selected to play against England as part of the Indian Board President's XI team in the England's tour of India in the 2006 season , and made his ODI debut for India later in the series. He then played England again at Indore in the same series. He has since been left out of the ODI team due to the presence of Munaf Patel and Irfan Pathan . He did not get any wickets during his two one-day matches. [1]
He made his Test debut against the West Indies in West Indies, taking two wickets. He has also played two tests against South Africa , in which he has achieved 2 more wickets. [1]
Injury and comeback[ edit ]
Injuries took a toll on VRV Singh's body and he could not play a domestic match for Punjab from 2008 to 2012, although he played few IPL matches for Kings XI Punjab. He had to go through complete process from Nets to Clubs to State team again. He made his T20 comeback vs Assam in March 2012. [10] He played five T20s and disappeared again. One and a half years later, he made his First-Class comeback after five years vs Haryana in November 2013 and took a 5-wicket haul in 1st Innings. [11]

[9] At grade cricket level, Head plays for Tea Tree Gully. [10]



Calcutta High Court
Kolkata is administered by several government agencies. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation , or KMC, oversees and manages the civic infrastructure of the city's 15 boroughs, which together encompass 141 wards. [105] Each ward elects a councillor to the KMC. Each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. By means of the borough committees, the corporation undertakes urban planning and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets. [115] As Kolkata's apex body, the corporation discharges its functions through the mayor-in-council, which comprises a mayor, a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the KMC. [116] The functions of the KMC include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, street lighting, and building regulation. [115]
The Kolkata Municipal Corporation was ranked 1st out of 21 Cities for best governance & administrative practices in India in 2014. It scored 4.0 on 10 compared to the national average of 3.3. [117]
The Kolkata Port Trust, an agency of the central government, manages the city's river port. As of 2012 [update] , the All India Trinamool Congress controls the KMC; the mayor is Sovan Chatterjee , while the deputy mayor is Farzana Alam. [7] The city has an apolitical titular post, that of the Sheriff of Kolkata , which presides over various city-related functions and conferences. [118]
Kolkata's administrative agencies have areas of jurisdiction that do not coincide. Listed in ascending order by area, they are: Kolkata district ; the Kolkata Police area and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation area, or "Kolkata city"; [119] and the Kolkata metropolitan area , which is the city's urban agglomeration. The agency overseeing the latter, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority , is responsible for the statutory planning and development of greater Kolkata. [120]
As the seat of the Government of West Bengal , Kolkata is home to not only the offices of the local governing agencies, but also the West Bengal Legislative Assembly ; the state secretariat, which is housed in the Writers' Building ; and the Calcutta High Court . Most government establishments and institutions are housed in the center of the city in B. B. D. Bagh (formerly known as Dalhousie Square). The Calcutta High Court is the oldest High Court in India. It was preceded by the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William which was established in 1774. The Calcutta High Court has jurisdiction over the state of West Bengal and the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Kolkata has lower courts: the Court of Small Causes and the City Civil Court decide civil matters; the Sessions Court rules in criminal cases. [121] [122] [123] The Kolkata Police , headed by a police commissioner, is overseen by the West Bengal Ministry of Home Affairs . [124] [125] The Kolkata district elects two representatives to India's lower house, the Lok Sabha , and 11 representatives to the state legislative assembly. [126]
Utility services

The Kolkata Municipal Corporation supplies the city with potable water that is sourced from the Hooghly River; [127] most of it is treated and purified at the Palta pumping station located in North 24 Parganas district. [128] Roughly 95% of the 4,000 tonnes of refuse produced daily by the city is transported to the dumping grounds in Dhapa , which is east of the town. [129] [130] To promote the recycling of garbage and sewer water, agriculture in encouraged on the dumping grounds. [131] Parts of the city lack proper sewerage, leading to unsanitary methods of waste disposal. [70]
Electricity is supplied by the privately operated Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation , or CESC, to the city proper; the West Bengal State Electricity Board supplies it in the suburbs. [132] [133] Fire services are handled by the West Bengal Fire Service , a state agency. [134] As of 2012 [update] , the city had 16 fire stations. [135]
State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited , or BSNL, as well as private enterprises, among them Vodafone , Bharti Airtel , Reliance , Idea Cellular , Aircel , Tata DoCoMo , Tata Teleservices , Virgin Mobile , and MTS India , are the leading telephone and cell phone service providers in the city. [136] :25–26:179 Kolkata being the first city in India to have cell phone and 4G connectivity, the GSM and CDMA cellular coverage is extensive. [137] [138] As of 2010 [update] , Kolkata has 7 percent of the total Broadband internet consumers in India; BSNL, VSNL, Tata Indicom, Sify, Airtel, and Reliance are among the main vendors. [139] [140]
Military and diplomatic establishments
The Ordnance Factories Board of the Ministry of Defence , the Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers and the Eastern Command of the Indian Army are all headquartered in the city. The U.S Consulate in Calcutta is the U.S. Department of State 's second oldest Consulate and dates from 19 November 1792. [141] The Consulate General serves the states of Bihar , Jharkhand , Odisha , West Bengal, Sikkim , Assam , Meghalaya , Tripura , Mizoram , Manipur , Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh .

Trams of Kolkata
Public transport is provided by the Kolkata Suburban Railway , the Kolkata Metro , trams , and buses. The suburban rail network reaches the city's distant suburbs. According to a 2013 survey conducted by International Association of Public Transport , Kolkata ranks the top among the six cities surveyed in India, in terms of public transport system. [142] [143] The Kolkata Metro, in operation since 1984, is the oldest underground mass transit system in India. [144] It spans the north–south length of the city and covers a distance of 25.1 km (16 mi). [145] As of 2009 [update] , five Metro rail lines were under construction. [146] Kolkata has four long-distance railway stations, located at Howrah (the largest railway complex in India), Sealdah , Chitpur and Shalimar , which connect Kolkata by rail to most cities in West Bengal and to other major cities in India. [147] The city serves as the headquarters of three railway Zone out of Seventeen of the Indian Railways regional divisions—the Kolkata Metro Railways , Eastern Railway and the South-Eastern Railway . [148]
Sealdah bound sub-urban train at Kalyani
Kolkata has rail and road connectivity with Dhaka , capital of Bangladesh . [149] [150] [151]
Buses, which are the most commonly used mode of transport, are run by government agencies and private operators. [152] Kolkata is the only Indian city with a tram network, which is operated by the Calcutta Tramways Company . [153] The slow-moving tram services are restricted to certain areas of the city. Water-logging, caused by heavy rains that fall during the summer monsoon, can interrupt transportation networks. [154] [155] Hired public conveyances include auto rickshaws , which often ply specific routes, and yellow metered taxis. Almost all of Kolkata's taxis are antiquated Hindustan Ambassadors by make; newer air-conditioned radio taxis are also in service. [156] [157] In parts of the city, cycle rickshaws and hand-pulled rickshaws are patronised by the public for short trips. [158]
Due to its diverse and abundant public transportation, privately owned vehicles are not as common in Kolkata as in other major Indian cities. [159] The city has witnessed a steady increase in the number of registered vehicles; 2002 data showed an increase of 44% over a period of seven years. [160] As of 2004 [update] , after adjusting for population density, the city's "road space" was only 6% compared to 23% in Delhi and 17% in Mumbai. [161] The Kolkata Metro has somewhat eased traffic congestion, as has the addition of new roads and flyovers. Agencies operating long-distance bus services include Calcutta State Transport Corporation , South Bengal State Transport Corporation , North Bengal State Transport Corporation , and various private operators. The city's main bus terminals are located at Esplanade, Karunamoyee , and Babughat . [162] The Kolkata–Delhi and Kolkata–Chennai prongs of the Golden Quadrilateral , and National Highway 34 start from the city. [163]
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport , located in Dum Dum some 16 km (9.9 mi) north-east of the city centre, operates domestic and international flights. In 2013, the airport was upgraded to handle increased air traffic. [164] [165] The Port of Kolkata , established in 1870, is India's oldest and the only major river port. [166] The Kolkata Port Trust manages docks in Kolkata and Haldia . [167] The port hosts passenger services to Port Blair , capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands ; freighter service to ports throughout India and around the world is operated by the Shipping Corporation of India . [166] [168] Ferry services connect Kolkata with its twin city of Howrah , located across the Hooghly River. [169] [170]
Healthcare

IPGMER and SSKM Hospital , Kolkata is the largest hospital in West Bengal and one of the oldest in Kolkata.
As of 2011 [update] , the health care system in Kolkata consists of 48 government hospitals, mostly under the Department of Health & Family Welfare , Government of West Bengal, and 366 private medical establishments; [171] these establishments provide the city with 27,687 hospital beds. [171] For every 10,000 people in the city, there are 61.7 hospital beds, [172] which is higher than the national average of 9 hospital beds per 10,000. [173] Ten medical and dental colleges are located in the Kolkata metropolitan area which act as tertiary referral hospitals in the state. [174] [175] Calcutta Medical College , founded in 1835, was the first institution in Asia to teach modern medicine. [176] These facilities are inadequate to meet the healthcare needs of the city. [177] [178] [179] More than 78% in Kolkata prefer the private medical sector over the public medical sector, [113] :109 due to the poor quality of care, the lack of a nearby facility, and excessive waiting times at government facilities. [113] :61
According to the 2005 National Family Health Survey, only a small proportion of Kolkata households were covered under any health scheme or health insurance . [113] :41 The total fertility rate in Kolkata was 1.4, which was the lowest among the eight cities surveyed. [113] :45 In Kolkata, 77% of the married women used contraceptives , which was the highest among the cities surveyed, but use of modern contraceptive methods was the lowest (46%). [113] :47 The infant mortality rate in Kolkata was 41 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 49 per 1,000 live births. [113] :48
Among the surveyed cities, Kolkata stood second (5%) for children who had not had any vaccinations under the Universal Immunization Programme as of 2005 [update] . [113] :48 Kolkata ranked second among the surveyed cities, with access to an anganwadi centre under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme for 57% of the children between 0 and 71 months. [113] :51 The proportion of malnourished , anaemic and underweighhe afternoon if the setting sun prevents a clear view of the popping crease at his end.
It is up to the umpires to keep out of the way of both the ball and the players. In particular, if the ball is hit and the players attempt a run, then the umpire behind the stumps will generally retreat to the side, in case the fielding side attempts a run out at that end.
At the end of each over, the two umpires will exchange roles. Because the bowlers end alternates between overs, this means they only move a short distance.
For certain decisions during a match, the on-field umpire may refer to the Third Umpire if there is one appointed, who has access to television replays. The Third Umpire is most often used in the case of run-outs, where the action is too fast for the naked eye but can be also used to decide the cases of disputed boundaries and catches, when the umpires cannot decide if the ball has struck the ground before being caught (but not to decide whether or not the ball in fact struck the bat or gloves of a batsman). Third Umpire referrals for LBW dismissals have also been trialled in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy is Sri Lanka, and in the 2007 English Domestic Pro40 competition, and are currently being trialled in international matches.
Decisions and signals[ edit ]
This section relies too much on references to primary sources . Please improve this article by adding secondary or tertiary sources .
(June 2010)
During play, the umpire at the bowler's end makes the decisions, which he mainly indicates using arm movements. Some decisions must be instantaneous, whereas for others he may pause to think or discuss it with the square leg umpire, especially if the latter may have had a better view.
When the ball is in play[ edit ]
These decisions have an important effect on the play and are signalled straight away.
Out[ edit ]
An umpire signalling the batsman as out
An umpire will not give a batsman out unless an appeal is made by the fielding side, though a batsman may walk if he knows himself to be out. This is nowadays rare, especially in Tests and first-class matches for contentious decisions; however, it is the norm for a batsman to walk when he is out bowled or out to an obvious catch . If the fielding side believes a batsman is out, the fielding side must appeal, by asking "How's that?"(Howzzatt), "Wot Wot" or "How was he?" (or by any other means that either umpire deems as a method of appealing).
The umpire's response is either to raise his index finger above his head to indicate that the batsman is out, or to clearly say "not out", which is usually accompanied with a shake of the head. (See BBC Sport ). The 'out' signal is the only signal that if indicated by the striker's end umpire, does not require confirmation by the bowler's end umpire. [2]
No-ball[ edit ]
Either umpire may call, and signal, No Ball, for a ball which is illegally delivered ( bowled ), although each umpire has unique jurisdictions. The most usual causes for No Balls are foot faults or a ball passing above a batsman's head, each of these being under the bowler's end umpire's jurisdiction. The square-leg umpire will rarely have to call a No Ball, as his jurisdiction is limited to infringements which very rarely occur. The signal is to hold one arm out horizontally and shout "no-ball"; the idea being that the batsman is aware of the no-ball being bowled. BBC Sport . The no-ball doesn't count as one of the six in the over, and severely reduces the ways in which a batsman may be out (from 11 to 5), with the most common forms of dismissal all being removed, except for Run Out. The batsman may attempt to score runs from the 'extra' ball, however. In matches under the auspices of the ICC, it may also be a no-ball if the umpire feels that the bowler's arm is bent more than 15 degrees (Throwing rather than bowling). The ICC have chosen to amend Law 24.3 (Definition of Fair Delivery – the arm) as a result of controversy concerning the legality or otherwise of bowling actions of certain prominent bowlers.
Free hit[ edit ]
In certain forms of limited-overs cricket, like Twenty20 and One Day International , a no-ball that is the result of the bowler overstepping the crease will be penalised by the next delivery being subject to limited methods of dismissal. The umpire will signal this by circling a finger horizontally over his head, usually following a no-ball signal (and any other signals associated with the no-ball such as a boundary). During a free hit delivery, batsmen cannot be dismissed caught , bowled , leg before wicket , or stumped .
Wide[ edit ]
A Wide Ball is an illegal delivery in cricket, which is illegal due to it being "wide of the striker where he is standing and would also have passed wide of him standing in a normal guard position." (Law 25) A wide signalled by extending both arms out horizontally and is accompanied by a call of Wide Ball. It does not count in the over, and again reduces the way in which a batsman can be out (from 11 to 6; one can be stumped off at wide). This matter is incomplete If a delivery satisfies the criteria for both a No Ball and a Wide, the call and penalty of No Ball will take precedent.
Dead ball[ edit ]
If the ball is no longer considered in play it is a dead ball . An umpire will signal this by crossing and uncrossing his wrists below his waist with the call Dead Ball, if he is required to do so under certain Laws, and also may do it if he thinks it is necessary to inform the players. See BBC Sport .
A similar signal is also used to indicate a "not out" from the Decision Review System. This is signalled by an umpire crossing his hands in a horizontal position in front and above his waist three times. [3]
Signals to scorers[ edit ]
It is important that the scorers note down the play accurately and therefore the appropriate signals will be made by the umpire when the ball is dead (see Law 3.14). In addition to the following, the umpire repeats signals of dead ball, wide, and no-ball to the scorers. Scorers are required to acknowledge the signals from umpires; and umpires are required to get an acknowledgement before allowing the match to proceed.
Four[ edit ]
If a batsman scores four by hitting the ball across the boundary (not by actually running them), the umpire signals this by waving his arm back and forth in front of the chest. This signal varies a lot between umpires, from two short, restrained, waves finishing with the arm across the chest, to elaborate signals that resemble those of a conductor of an orchestra. See BBC Sport . Whichever way the umpire signals a four he must, by law, finish with his arm across the chest (so as to avoid confusion about whether a No Ball was delivered as well).
Six[ edit ]
A six scored by hitting the ball over the boundary is signalled by the umpire raising both hands above his head, often in a celebratory manner. [4] For a six to be scored, the ball must come off the bat, so it is impossible to have six byes for a ball crossing the boundary (without there being overthrows).
Bye[ edit ]
If runs are to be scored as byes , the umpire will hold up one open palm above the head. See BBC Sport .

Role[ edit ]
Once dismissed, a batsman cannot score any more runs in that innings. Thus dismissal is often the best way to control the runs scored in an innings, and prevent the batting side from either achieving their target score or posting a large total for the fielding side to follow in the next innings.
Additionally, in Test cricket it is usually necessary for a side fielding last to have dismissed ten players of the opposing team in their final innings to achieve victory (unless one or more of the batsmen have retired hurt or absent and unable to take the field). A batsman can only score runs from an over.
Adjudication[ edit ]
By convention, dismissal decisions are handled primarily by the players – thus if the dismissal is obvious the batsman will voluntarily leave the field without the umpire needing to dismiss him. If the batsman and fielding side disagree about a dismissal then the fielding side must appeal to the umpire who will then decide whether the batsman is out. In competitive cricket, many difficult catching and LBW decisions will be left to the umpire; if a batsman acknowledges that he is out in such cases and departs without waiting for the umpire's decision it is known as "walking", and regarded as an honourable but controversial act. [1]
If the umpire believes he has incorrectly dismissed a batsman, he may recall him to the crease if he has not already left the field of play. An example of this was in the 2007 Lord's test match between England and India when Kevin Pietersen was initially given out caught behind, but was recalled when television replays showed that the ball had bounced before being taken by Mahendra Singh Dhoni . [2]
Methods of dismissal[ edit ]
A batsman can be dismissed in a number of ways, the most common being bowled, caught, leg before wicket (LBW), stumped and run out. Much rarer are hit wicket, hit the ball twice, handled the ball, obstructing the field and timed out.
The bowler is credited in the statistics with having taken a wicket if the batsman is out bowled, LBW, caught, stumped, or hit wicket. If the ball is a no ball then the batsman cannot be out in any of these ways. The bowler is not credited with having taken a wicket if the batsman is run out, handles the ball, hits the ball twice, or obstructs the field; these dismissals may occur if the delivery is a no ball . The fieldsman is credited in the statistics with a dismissal if he takes a stumping (for a stumping this will necessarily be the wicket-keeper ), and may be credited on scorecards for a run-out (although a run-out will not be credited to a player's statistics).
Law 2. 9b: Retired [ edit ]
If any batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire's consent for any reason other than injury or incapacity, he may resume the innings only with the consent of the opposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he is out. For the purposes of calculating a batting average , retired out is considered a dismissal.
Only two players in Test history have ever been given out in this manner: Marvan Atapattu (for 201) and Mahela Jayawardene (for 150), both in the same innings of the same match playing for Sri Lanka against Bangladesh in September 2001. Apparently, this was done in order to give the other players batting practice, but was considered unsportsmanlike and drew criticism. [6] In May 1983, Gordon Greenidge of the West Indies retired out on 154 to visit his daughter, who was ill and who died two days later; he was subsequently judged to have retired not out, the only such decision in Test history. [7]
There are numerous other recorded instances of batsmen retiring out in first-class cricket , particularly in tour matches and warm-up matches; since these matches are generally treated as practice matches, retiring out in these matches is not considered unsportsmanlike. In 1993 Graham Gooch , immediately after completing his hundredth first-class century with a six, retired on 105. [8]
A batsman is bowled out.
Law 30: Bowled [ edit ]
If a bowler's delivery hits the stumps and a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, the striker (the batsman facing the bowler) is out (assuming the bail does not luckily land back in the stump's spigots). The ball can either have struck the stumps directly, or have been deflected off the bat or body of the batsman. However, the batsman is not bowled out if the ball is touched by a fielder or touched by a wicket-keeper or the umpire before hitting the stumps.
Law 31: Timed out [ edit ]
An incoming batsman is “timed out” if he willfully takes more than three minutes to be ready to face the next delivery (or be at the other end if not on strike). [9] If a not out batsman is not ready after a break in play, they can also be given out Timed Out on appeal. In the case of extremely long delays, the umpires may forfeit the match to either team. So far this method of taking a wicket has never been employed in the history of Test cricket.
There have been only five occasions in all forms of First-Class cricket where a batsman has been given out Timed Out. [10] These are:
Andrew Jordaan – Eastern Province v Transvaal at Port Elizabeth in 1987–88 (Jordaan, not out overnight, was prevented from reaching the ground by flooded roads the following day)
Hemulal Yadav – Tripura v Orissa at Cuttack in 1997–98 (Yadav, in conversation with his team manager on the boundary, did not attempt to reach the crease)
V.C. Drakes – Border v Free State at East London in 2002 (Drakes was still on his way to the match by aeroplane from his native West Indies when he was due to bat)
A.J. Harris – Nottinghamshire v Durham UCCE at Nottingham in 2003 (Harris, suffering from a groin strain, took too long to walk to the crease and was given out on appeal).
Ryan Austin - Combined Campuses and Colleges v Windward Islands at Kingstown in 2014 (Austin, the number 11 batsman, failed to reach the crease in the requisite amount of time).
Law 32: Caught [ edit ]
If the batsman hits the ball with the bat (or with the glove when the glove is in contact with the bat) and the ball is caught by the bowler or a fielder before it hits the ground, then the batsman is out. The batsman cannot be given out caught if the ball strikes a helmet (or other external protective equipment excluding a keeper wearing gloves or pads) worn by a member of the fielding side prior to being caught, regardless of whether it touches the ground or not.
In an extraordinary dismissal during the VB ODI series against Sri Lanka on 13 January 2006, Andrew Symonds was given out caught when the ball ricocheted (on the full) off the pad of the non-striker (Michael Clarke) into the hands of Tillakaratne Dilshan at mid-wicket.
"Caught behind" (an unofficial term) indicates that a player was caught by the wicket-keeper, or less commonly by the slips. "Caught and bowled" (another unofficial term) indicates the player who bowled the ball also took the catch.
Law 33: Handled the ball [ edit ]
If the batsman touches the ball with his hand not in contact with the bat for any purpose other than, with the approval of the fielder(s), to return the ball to the bowler, he is out on appeal. It is considered etiquette for the fielding team not to appeal if the handling of the ball does not affect the play of the game, although there are occasions when this etiquette has been ignored.
Only seven batsmen have been out handled the ball in the history of Test cricket: Russell Endean , Andrew Hilditch , Mohsin Khan , Desmond Haynes , Graham Gooch , Steve Waugh and Michael Vaughan . [11] Two batsmen have been given out in this fashion in One Day Internationals: [12]
Mohinder Amarnath was dismissed after pushing away a turning ball from Greg Matthews that spun back towards his wicket. [13]
Daryll Cullinan was given out handled the ball after chopping Keith Arthurton into the ground and catching the rebound, which may have been heading towards the stumps. [14]
[Ben Stokes was given out after holding out his glove the fear that he would be hit by the ball thrown by Mitchell Starc.
Law 34: Hit the ball twice [ edit ]
If the batsman "hits" the ball twice, he is out. The first hit is considered to be if the ball has struck the batsman or his bat, whilst the second "hit" has to be an intentional and separate contact with the ball – again not necessarily using the bat. The batsman may hit the ball a second time with his bat or body (not a hand not in contact with the bat) if it is performed to stop the ball from hitting the stumps. It is therefore possible to be out hitting the ball twice, whilst not actually hitting the ball with the bat at all.
No batsman has been out hitting the ball twice in Test cricket .
Law 35: Hit wicket [ edit ]
If the batsman dislodges his own stumps with his body or bat, while in the process of taking a shot or beginning his first run, then he is out. This law does not apply if he avoided a ball thrown back to the wicket by a fielder, or broke the wicket in avoiding a run out.
This law also applies if t children in Kolkata was less in comparison to other surveyed cities. [113] :54–55
About 18% of the men and 30% of the women in Kolkata are obese —the majority of them belonging to the non-poor strata of society. [113] :105 In 2005, Kolkata had the highest percentage (55%) among the surveyed cities of anaemic woman, while 20% of the men in Kolkata were anaemic. [113] :56–57 Diseases like diabetes , asthma , goitre and other thyroid disorders were found in large numbers of people. [113] :57–59 Tropical diseases like malaria , dengue and chikungunya are prevalent in Kolkata, though their incidence is decreasing. [180] [181] Kolkata is one of the districts in India with a high number of people with AIDS; it has been designated a district prone to high risk. [182] [183]
Because of higher air pollution, the life expectancy of a person born in the city in 2014, is four years fewer than in the suburbs. [184]

Kolkata's schools are run by the state government or private organisations, many of which are religious. Bengali and English are the primary languages of instruction; Urdu and Hindi are also used, particularly in central Kolkata. [185] [186] Schools in Kolkata follow the "10+2+3" plan . After completing their secondary education, students typically enroll in schools that have a higher secondary facility and are affiliated with the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education , the ICSE , or the CBSE . [185] They usually choose a focus on liberal arts, business, or science. Vocational programs are also available. [185] Some Kolkata schools, for example La Martiniere Calcutta , St. Xavier's Collegiate School , and Loreto House , have been ranked amongst the best schools in the country. [187]
As of 2010 [update] , the Kolkata urban agglomeration is home to 14 universities run by the state government. [188] The colleges are each affiliated with a university or institution based either in Kolkata or elsewhere in India. Aliah University which was founded in 1780 as Mohammedan College of Calcutta is the oldest post-secondary educational institution of the city. [189] The University of Calcutta , founded in 1857, is the first modern university in South Asia .

Shahbaz Nadeem born August 1989, in Muzaffarpur , Bihar [1] is a slow left-arm orthodox bowler for Indian U-19s . He has played for Bihar Under-14 side and currently plays for Jharkhand and Delhi Daredevpart of the batsman's equipment is dislodged and hits the stumps: Dwayne Bravo hit Kevin Pietersen in the head with a bouncer and his helmet hit the stumps during the 2007 England vs West Indies Test match at Old Trafford; a topspinner from Richie Benaud once knocked off Joe Solomon 's cap, and the cap landed on Solomon's stumps.
Being out hit-wicket is often seen as a comic method of dismissal. In 1991 Jonathan Agnew and Brian Johnston , commentators on BBC Radio 's Test Match Special , got themselves into difficulty while commentating on Ian Botham 's dismissal (Botham dislodged his leg bail whilst trying to step over the stumps, having lost his balance in missing a hook shot against Curtly Ambrose ), Agnew commenting that he "couldn't quite get his leg over". [15]
The most crucial hit-wicket dismissal in Test history was arguably that of Graeme Smith at Trent Bridge in 2003: Smith had made 277 (South Africa's second highest ever Test innings) and 85 from 70 balls at Edgbaston, and 259 at Lord's, as South Africa dominated the first two Tests of the series. In the third, Smith was on 35 when he played back to Andrew Flintoff and trod on his stumps. His form shattered, he did not reach 20 again in the series as England fought back for a morale-boosting 2–2 series draw, a result which marked the start of a resurgence which would ultimately lead to the 2005 Ashes victory.
A more recent example of a comic hit-wicket dismissal was during the Headingley Test match in the 2006 test series between England and Pakistan , when Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq missed a sweep against Monty Panesar , was hit in the midriff by the ball, lost his balance and collapsed on to his stumps (and nearly into wicket-keeper Chris Read ). [16]
Law 36: Leg before wicket (LBW)[ edit ]
If the ball strikes any part of the batsman's person (not necessarily the leg), and, in the umpire 's judgement, the ball would have hit the batsman's stumps but for this interception, then the batsman is out. The point of impact must be within line with the batsman's stumps and the bowler's stumps if the batsman is playing a stroke. The batsman can be given out if the ball strikes him outside the off stump, if the ball would have hit the stumps and if the batsman is playing no stroke. The ball must not pitch outside the line of leg stump. Also, the ball cannot have made contact with the bat or glove that is touching the bat before hitting the batsman. If the ball hits the batsman either on the full or immediately after bouncing, the umpire is required to assume that the ball is travelling straight on, ignoring any spin, swing or other hard to predict movement that may have changed the direction of the ball if it had not hit the batsman.
Law 37: Obstructing the field [ edit ]
If the batsman, by action or by words, obstructs a fielder, then he is out. However, a batsman is allowed to obstruct the view of a fielder by standing in front of him. He may also stand in between the fielder and the stumps. The rule intends to prevent batsman from interfering with a fielder by, for instance, pushing him. Also, a player may be given out if they deliberately hit a ball being thrown back to the keeper whilst being out of their crease, as happened to Inzamam-ul-Haq (see below).
Only one individual has ever been out obstructing the field in a Test match: England's Len Hutton , playing against South Africa at The Oval in London in 1951, knocked a ball away from his stumps, but in doing so prevented the South African wicket-keeper Russell Endean from completing a catch. [17] By coincidence, Endean was one of the few people to be given out handled the ball in a Test match (see above).
In One Day International cricket, six batsmen have been given out obstructing the field: [12]
Rameez Raja – for Pakistan v Australia in November 1987 (seeking a second run to complete his century off the final ball of the match and found short of the crease, Rameez blocked a fielder's return with his bat, being given out for 99)
Mohinder Amarnath – for India v Sri Lanka in October 1989 (Amarnath pushed a ball away from his stumps)
Inzamam-ul-Haq – for Pakistan v India in February 2006 (Inzamam blocked a fielder's return throw with his bat while short of the crease). [18]
Anwar Ali - for Pakistan v South Africa in November 2013 (blocked a fielder's throw to the bowler's end while running down the pitch. The decision was made after consultation with the third umpire.)
Mohammad Hafeez - for Pakistan v South Africa in March 2013 [Durban, South Africa]
Ben Stokes - for England v Australia in September 2015 at Lord's , England (out of his crease after playing the ball back down the pitch, he used his hand to block bowler Mitchell Starc 's return throw at the stumps - the decision was made by the third umpire Joel Wilson ) [19]
Law 38: Run out [ edit ]
If a fielder uses the ball to remove the bails from either set of stumps whilst the batsmen are running between the wickets (or otherwise away from the crease during the course of play), then the batsman (striker or non-striker) is out. The batsman nearest the set of stumps from which the bails were removed, but not actually in safe territory, is given out. If the batsman has any part of his body or his bat (if he's holding it) on the ground behind the line of the crease, then he cannot be run out (except if both batsmen are on the same side of a crease) i.e. on the line is considered as out; frequently it is a close call whether or not a batsman gained his ground in this way before the bails were removed. (The difference between stumped and run out is that the wicketkeeper may stump a batsman who goes too far forward to play the ball (assuming he isn't attempting a run), whilst any fielder, including the keeper, may run out a batsman who goes too far for any other purpose, including for taking a run.) If the bails have already been removed, a fielder can remove a remaining stump by pulling it out or hit out the stump (ensure that the stump is fully out of ground) from the ground with the ball in their hands. A fielder can also "remake" the stumps and remove a stump/bail to effect a runout.
If a batsman has a runner due to injury/illness there is the danger of being runout due to confusion between the three (or four in very rare circumstances) batsmens/runners on the field, all of whom must be safe in their crease when the wicket is broken and also at the correct end of the wicket. For example, a batsman who is batting with a runner should always be behind the crease at the striker's end whilst the ball is live. If he forgets that he has a runner a quick minded fielder is able to break the stumps at the striker's end to run him out—even if he finds himself safely behind the crease at the bowler's end.
A special form of run-out is when the batsman at the non-striker 's end attempts to gain an advantage by leaving the crease before the next ball has been bowled (a common practice known as "backing up", but against the laws of cricket if the non-striker leaves his crease before the bowler has released the ball). The bowler may then dislodge the bails at his/her end without completing the run-up and dismiss the batsman. This form of run-out is called the Mankad (the dismissed batsman is said to have been "Mankaded"), in reference to Vinoo Mankad , the first bowler to dismiss a batsman in this manner in a Test match, running out Bill Brown in 1947. With the changes in the Laws of Cricket relatively recently, a bowler cannot Mankad a batsman once they enter their delivery stride. However, the ICC playing conditions for international cricket permit the bowler to remove the bails at any time prior to the point in their delivery swing where they would normally release the ball. [20] It is considered good etiquette to warn a batsman that he is leaving his crease early, before attempting a Mankad run out on a subsequent ball.
A run out cannot occur if no fielder has touched the ball. As such, if a batsman plays a straight drive which breaks the non-striker's stumps whilst he is outside his crease, he is not out. However, if a fielder (usually the bowler, in this case) touches the ball at all before it breaks the stumps at the non-striker's end, then it is a run out, even if the fielder never has any control of the ball.
Law 39: Stumped [ edit ]
If the striker steps in front of the crease to play the ball, leaving no part of his anatomy or the bat on the ground behind the crease, and the wicket-keeper is able to remove the bails from the wicket with the ball, then the striker is out. A stumping is most likely to be effected off slow bowling, or (less frequently) medium-paced bowling when the wicketkeeper is standing directly behind the stumps. As wicket-keepers stand several yards back from the stumps to fast bowlers, stumpings are hardly ever effected off fast bowlers. But a keeper may throw down the stumps and the batsman is still out stumped if he is out of his ground, but not attempting a run. Similarly, the ball can bounce off a keeper (but not external non-usual wicketkeeping protective equipment, like a helmet) and break the stumps and still be considered a stumping.

Even before he made his first-class debut, Nadeem was seen as the next big left-arm slow bowler. He has a classical, flowing lefty's action, is naturally inclined to bowl round the wicket to right-hand batsmen, and has the boldness to experiment with varying degrees of loop. In addition, he is an athletic fielder and a fixture at point for his state and the East Zone side. He came into the reckoning with a nine-wicket haul against Sikkim in an Under-15 game in 2002. His first-class debut earlier this season was impressive, but he found himself under the hammer against Australia in the Under-19 one-dayers, and played only one match in the Under-19 World Cup.
In Early Life he was staying in Siwandih , Bokaro Steel City , and practicing in Bokaro Training Hostel.
In the 2012 IPL season Nadeem made a breakthrough in the Delhi Daredevils team with impressive performances. He was also one of the seven players nominated for IPL Rising Star of the year award. He is one of the most energetic Young bowler.

వికెట్-కీపింగ్ అనేది ఒక ప్రత్యేకమైన కళ మరియు దీనికి ఒక నైపుణ్యం కలిగిన బ్యాట్స్ మ్యాన్ లేదా బౌలర్ కు అనుగుణమైన స్థాయిలో శిక్షణ అవసరము. అయినప్పటికీ, ఈనాటి ఆధునిక కీపర్లు కావాల్సిన స్థాయిలో బ్యాటింగ్ నైపుణ్యమును కూడా కలిగి కనీసం మిడిల్ ఆర్డర్ కు సరిపోయే విధంగా ఉండాలి అని అనుకుంటున్నారు. ఉత్తమ స్థాయిలో బ్యాటింగ్ చేయగల వికెట్-కీపర్లు అనియతంగా కీపర్/బ్యాట్స్ మ్యాన్ అని తెలుపుతారు.

Career[ edit ]
The younger son of former English Test cricketer Micky Stewart , Stewart was educated at Tiffin School in Kingston upon Thames . [2] He made his debut for Surrey in 1981, earning a reputation as an aggressive opening batsman and occasional wicketkeeper. He made his England debut in the first Test of the 1989/90 tour of the West Indies , along with Nasser Hussain , who would eventually replace him as England captain.
At the start of his career, Stewart was a specialist opening batsman for England, with wicketkeeping duties being retained by Jack Russell , who was generally recognised as the superior gloveman and who batted down the order. However, Russell, the inferior batsman, would often be dropped to improve the balance of the side (i.e. to accommodate an extra bowler or batsman), in which case Stewart would don the gloves. After enduring years of selection and deselection, Russell retired from international cricket in 1998, leaving Stewart unrivalled as England's keeper-batsman until his own retirement in 2003.
His highest Test score, 190, was against Pakistan in the drawn first Edgbaston Test on 4 June 1992; it was his fourth century in five Tests. In 1994 at the Kensington Oval he became only the seventh Englishman to score centuries in both innings of a Test match, scoring 118 and 143 as the West Indies were beaten at their Bridgetown "fortress" for the first time since 1935. [3]
Stewart was groomed for the England captaincy under Graham Gooch , deputising for him in four tests in India and Sri Lanka in 1993, but when Gooch retired from the captaincy later that year Mike Atherton was chosen to succeed him.
Always more of an establishment figure than any sort of rebel, it was no surprise when Stewart was asked to captain England in 1998 when Mike Atherton resigned. Despite being the age of 35 at the time, Stewart's level of fitness was impeccable, especially bearing in mind that most players do not continue beyond 37. As it was Stewart went on to play for England beyond his 40th birthday – but as events were to transpire – his captaincy of England barely lasted 12 months.
In his first series as captain, against South Africa , Stewart scored an outstanding 164 in the third Test at Old Trafford to salvage a draw, a result which eventually enabled England to overturn a 1–0 deficit to win the series 2–1. Nonetheless, failures against Australia and in the 1999 cricket World Cup saw him sacked from the captaincy to be replaced by Hussain. During his captaincy, he had the unusual distinction of simultaneously captaining the side, opening the batting and keeping wicket. He continued to deputise occasionally as captain of England's one-day side, and became the second international captain to concede a match in 2001, after a pitch invasion during a One Day International against Pakistan rendered the continuation of play impossible. [4] He continued as an England player for five more seasons, and became only the fourth player to score a century in his 100th Test, scoring 105 against the West Indies at Old Trafford in 2000.
Stewart's batting average (39.54) is the lowest of any player to have scored 8000 or more runs in Test cricket: he is the only player to have scored over 8000 runs despite an average of under 40. [5] However, when played as a specialist batsman in Test cricket, Stewart averaged 46.90 in 51 games with 9 centuries. Since World War II , only Len Hutton , Geoff Boycott , Dennis Amiss and Alastair Cook have bettered Stewart's average of 46 as a specialist opening batsman for England. [6] As wicketkeeper-batsman he averaged 34.92 from 82 tests, higher than many of his contemporaries and many of the current batch of international wicketkeepers. He was unlucky enough to be on the losing side in a record 54 Test Matches.
Stewart is a well-known supporter of Surrey County Cricket Club and Chelsea F.C. When shirt numbers were introduced for One Day International cricket, Stewart chose the number 4 shirt in honour of his favourite Chelsea player when growing up, John Hollins , and kept that shirt number throughout his career. [7]
Post-playing career[ edit ]
In 2004, Stewart became a founding director of Arundel Promotions with specific responsibility for player management and representation. Cricket playing clients include Paul Collingwood , Ian Bell , Ashley Giles and Matt Prior . [8]
In 2009, Stewart rejoined Surrey as a part-time consultant to the coaching staff specialising in batting, wicket keeping and mentoring. [9]
Since retiring from playing Stewart has taken on the role as the Club Ambassador for Surrey CCC and was made an executive director in 2011.
On 17 June 2013, it was announced by Surrey County Cricket Club that Stewart would take charge of first team affairs following the sacking of Chris Adams , until a long term successor is found.

This keeper is "''standing up''" close to the wicket, for a slow pace bowler or [[spin bowling|spin bowler]]]] [[Image:Wicket-Keeping Gloves.jpg|thumb|A pair of wicket-keeping gloves. The webbing which helps the keeper to catch the ball can be seen between the thumb and index fingers.]] The '''wicket-keeper''' in the sport of [[cricket]] is the player on the [[fielding (cricket)|fielding side]] who stands behind the [[wicket]] or stumps being guarded by the [[batsman]] currently on strike. The wicket-keeper is the only member of the fielding side permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards.<ref name=Law40>{{cite news |url=http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-40-the-wicket-keeper,66,AR.html|publisher=Lords Home of Cricket |title=Law 40 The Wicket Keeper}}</ref> The wicket-keeper may also wear a helmet with a mesh face guard to help protect from injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricket-rules.com/Ground-and-Equipment.html |title=Ground and Equipment |publisher=Cricket Rules |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>  It is essentially a specialist role although a keeper is occasionally called upon to bowl, in which case another member of the fielding side temporarily keeps wicket. The role of the keeper is governed by Law 40 of the [[Laws of Cricket]].<ref name=Law40/> [[Image:Strauss_dismissal.jpg|thumb|right|'''[[Adam Gilchrist]]''' of [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] [[List of cricket terms#S|standing up]] to the stumps against [[England national cricket team|England]] during the fourth test of the [[2005 Ashes series]] in England.]]  == Purposes ==  The keeper's major function is to stop deliveries that pass the batsman (in order to prevent [[run (cricket)|runs]] being scored as 'byes'), but he can also attempt to [[dismissal (cricket)|dismiss]] the batsman in various ways: * The most common dismissal effected by the keeper is for him to ''[[catch (cricket)|catch]]'' a ball that has nicked the batsman's bat, called an ''edge'', before it bounces. Sometimes the keeper is also in the best position to catch a ball which has been hit high in the air. More catches are taken by wicket-keepers than by any other fielding position. * The keeper can ''[[Stumping|stump]]'' the batsman by using the ball to remove the [[bail (cricket)|bails]] from the [[stump (cricket)|stumps]], if the batsman has come out of his [[crease (cricket)|crease]] during a delivery. * When the ball is hit into the outfield, the keeper moves close to the stumps to catch the return throw from a fielder and, if possible, to ''[[run out]]'' a batsman.  A keeper's position depends on the [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]]: for [[fast bowling]] he will crouch some distance from the stumps, in order to have time to react to edges from the batsman, while for slower bowling, he will come much nearer to the stumps (known as "standing up"), to pressure the batsman into remaining within the crease or risk being stumped. The more skilled the keeper, the faster the bowling to which he is able to "stand up", for instance [[Godfrey Evans]] often stood up to [[Alec Bedser]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/12543.html|title=Godfrey Evans|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>  Wicket-keeping is a specialist discipline and it requires training consistent with the level expected of a specialist batsman or [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]]. However, the modern-day keeper is also expected to possess reasonable batting skill, suiting him for the middle order at least. Wicket-keepers who are also capable of batting at the top of the order are known informally as ''keeper/batsmen''.  Since there is only room for one keeper in a cricket side, selectors (especially at the international level) are often faced with a difficult choice between two or more skilled keepers. Often, one of the two keepers is an exceptional keeper, but only an average batsman, whereas the other is a keeper/batsman who is clearly better at batting, but not quite as good a keeper as his rival. One such selection dilemma was that faced by [[English cricket team|England]] selectors in the 1990s between [[Jack Russell (Gloucestershire cricketer)|Jack Russell]] (the pure keeper) and [[Alec Stewart]] (the keeper/batsman). They were never able to consistently choose between the two until 1998, when Russell began to fade: prior to that, they had regularly swapped the role, often with Stewart maintaining his place when not wicket-keeping thanks to his batting skill.  The keeper may also have a [[Captain (cricket)|captaincy]] role. Uniquely, they are usually involved in every delivery of an innings, and may be in a position to see things that the captain misses. They can frequently be heard encouraging the bowler, and may also indulge in the practice (not meant to be overheard) of "[[sledging (cricket)|sledging]]" the batsman with well timed comments about their skill, appearance or personal habits.  The keeper is the only fielder allowed to touch the ball with protective equipment, typically large padded gloves with webbing between the index finger and thumb, but no other webbing. The protection offered by the gloves is not always adequate. The England keeper [[Alan Knott]] sometimes placed [[steak]]s inside his gloves for added cushioning. Wicket-keepers also tend to wear leg pads and a box to protect the groin area.  Wicket-keepers are allowed to take off their pads and bowl, though this rarely happens but is not uncommon when matches are drifting to draws or a bowling team is desperate for a wicket. Two keepers have removed their pads and taken [[hat-trick (cricket)|hat-tricks]] in first-class cricket: Probir Sen for Bengal v Orissa at Cuttack in 1954–55 and [[Alan Smith (cricketer)|A.C. (Alan) Smith]] for Warwickshire v Essex at Clacton in 1965; Smith was a most unusual player in that he was primarily a wicket-keeper, but was sometimes selected as a frontline bowler.  == Legal specifications of wicket-keeping gloves ==  [[File:Wicket keeping gloves along with the inner gloves.jpg|thumb|right|Wicket keeping gloves along with the inner gloves]]  Law 40.2, which deals with the specifications for wicketkeepers' gloves, states that: If,.... the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the fingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. If used, the webbing shall be:  (a) a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing material attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks.  (b) such that the top edge of the webbing-  (i) does not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to the top of the thumb.  (ii) is taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended.<ref>http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-40-the-wicket-keeper,66,AR.html</ref>  == Substitutes ==  According to Law 2 of the Laws of Cricket, a substitute (taking the place of an ill or injured player) may not keep wicket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-2-substitutes-and-runners-batsman-or-fielder-leaving-the-field-batsman-retiring-batsman-commencing-innings,28,AR.html |title=Laws of Cricket &#124; Lord's |publisher=Lords.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref>  This rule is sometimes suspended, by agreement with the captain of the batting side, although Law 2 does not provide for such agreement to be made. For example, during the England–New Zealand [[test cricket|Test Match]] at [[Lord's]] in 1986, England's specialist keeper, [[Bruce French (cricketer)|Bruce French]] was injured during England's first innings. England then used 4 keepers in New Zealand's first innings: [[Bill Athey]] kept for the first two overs; 45-year-old veteran [[Bob Taylor (cricketer)|Bob Taylor]] was pulled out of the sponsor's tent to keep, immaculately, for overs 3 to 76; [[Bobby Parks (cricketer)|Bobby Parks]], the Hampshire keeper, was called up for overs 77 to 140; and Bruce French kept wicket for the final ball of the innings.<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153677.html</ref> The same two teams were involved in a wicketkeeper switch in 2015 when [[BJ Watling]] was injured, and his gloves was given to [[Tom Latham]] for the entire 2nd innings. In the second Test, however, both were relieved of their wicketkeeping duties, allowing [[Luke Ronchi]] to make his Test debut, having played many matches for both Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand also used 4 wicketkeepers for the 2nd Test, even when [[Brendon McCullum]] has given up wicket-keeping completely since 2013.  ==Occasional wicket-keepers== Occasional wicket-keepers are players that usually play in other roles but sometimes keep wicket.

In the sport of cricket , a bail is one of the two smaller sticks placed on top of the three stumps to form a wicket . The bails are used to determine when the wicket is broken, which in turn is one of the critical factors in determining whether a batsman is out bowled, stumped, run out or hit wicket.
A wicket consists of three stumps that are hammered into the ground, and topped with two bails.
The wicket is considered to be broken if either one or both of the bails fall from the stumps, or a stump is struck out of the ground, by:
the ball ,
the striking batsman's bat , or any part of the striker's body or clothing (even if it falls off), or
a fielder with the hand or arm holding the ball.
This means, for example, that if the ball hits the wicket directly from the bowler 's delivery, the batsman is only out bowled if a bail falls off, so a ball can actually brush or rest against the stumps without the batsman being dismissed (as long as the bail remains in its groove).
If a bail falls off the stumps for any other reason while the ball is still in play, and a later incident such as a run out attempt requires the wicket to be broken, then the other bail can be removed (if it has not yet fallen off), or a stump can be struck out of the ground or pulled up, as described above.
Each bail is made of a single cylindrically shaped piece of wood which has two smaller cylinders of wood protruding from each end. The large central cylinder is called the barrel and the smaller protrusions are the spigots. The spigots are of unequal length: the longer rests alone on one stump, while the shorter rests on the middle stump together with the short spigot of the other bail.
Special heavy bails made of denser wood (usually lignum vitae ) are sometimes used in windy conditions if the normal light bails are likely to be blown off the stumps. The umpires can decide to dispense with the bails completely (for example, where strong gusts of wind would remove even the heavy bails), in which case the umpires will adjudge whether or not the wicket is broken.

Orthodox technique and strokeplay[ edit ]
Names of orthodox cricket shots and the directions in which they are hit for a right-handed batsman. The batsman is standing at the centre point facing south. The positions are mirrored for left-handers.
Over time a standard batting technique has been developed which is used by most batsmen. Technique refers to the batsman's stance before the ball is bowled as well as the movement of the hands, feet, head and body in the execution of a cricket stroke. Good technique is characterised by quickly getting into the correct position to play the shot, especially getting one's head and body in line with the ball , one's feet placed next to where the ball would bounce and then swinging the bat at the ball to make contact at the precise moment required for the particular stroke being played.
The movement of the batsman for a particular delivery depends on the shot being attempted. Front-foot shots are played with the weight on the front foot (left foot for a right-hander) and are usually played when the ball is pitched up to the batsman, while back-foot shots are played putting the weight onto the back foot, usually to bowling that is pitched short. Shots may also be described as vertical bat shots, in which the bat is swung vertically at the ball (e.g. when playing a drive or leg glance), or horizontal or cross-bat shots, in which the bat is swung horizontally at the ball (e.g. when playing the pull or cut shot).
While a batsman is not limited in where or how he may hit the ball, the development of good technique has gone hand in hand with the development of standard or orthodox cricket shots played to specific types of deliveries. These "textbook" shots are standard material found in many coaching manuals.
The advent of limited overs cricket , with its emphasis on rapid run-scoring, has led to increasing use of unorthodox shots to hit the ball into gaps where there are no fielders . Unorthodox shots are typically—but not always— more high-risk than orthodox shots due to some aspects of good batting technique being abandoned.
Stance[ edit ]
The stance is the position in which a batsman stands in order to have the ball bowled to him. An ideal stance is "comfortable relaxed and balanced," with the feet 40 centimetres (16 in) apart, parallel and astride the crease. Additionally, the front shoulder should be pointing down the wicket, the head facing the bowler, the weight equally balanced and the bat near the back toe. [1] As the ball is about to be released, the batsman will lift his bat up behind up in anticipation of playing a stroke, and will shift his weight onto the balls of his feet. By doing this he is ready to move swiftly into position to address the ball once he sees its path out of the bowler's hand.
Although this text-book, side-on stance is the most common, a few international batsmen, such as Shivnarine Chanderpaul , use an "open" or "square on" stance.
Backlift[ edit ]
Backlift is the term used to describe how a batsman lifts his bat in preparation for hitting the ball. [2]
While the bat should be raised as vertically as possible, coaching manuals often suggest that correct technique is for the bat to be slightly angled from the perpendicular; a common instruction is to point the face of the bat in the direction of first or second slip . [2]
Some players (notably, in recent times, Brian Lara ) [3] have employed an exaggerated backlift. Others, who have employed the more unorthodox open stance, such as Peter Willey , had a more abbreviated backlift.
Forward and back[ edit ]
Depending upon the path of the ball, the batsman will either move forward or back in his attempt to intercept it. A forward movement is designated a front foot shot, whereas a backwards movement is designated a back foot shot. A front foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between ankle and thigh height. The batsman will step forward towards the ball, bending his front knee in order to bring his bat down to the anticipated height of the ball. By moving forwards, the batsman is also able to intercept the ball immediately after it has pitched, thus nullifying any potentially dangerous lateral movement. A back foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between thigh and head height. The batsman will step back and, if necessary, stand on his tip toes to raise his bat to the height of the ball. By stepping back towards the wicket, he also receives the advantage of having an extra small amount of time to react to any unexpected lateral movement or variation in bounce. The famous 'back drive', made famous by Sir Donald Bradman. This involves the use of deft footwork and skilled bat handling to allow the impression of a genuine front foot shot when the batsmen is actually on the back foot- thus the stroke being given the name 'back drive'.
Leave[ edit ]
The leave. Note the batsman's head focussed on where the ball had bounced. The bat and hands are held well out of the way of the ball.
The leave is sometimes considered a cricket shot, even though the batsman physically does not play at or interfere with the ball as it passes him. The leave is likely to be used by batsmen during the first few balls they receive, to give themselves time to judge the conditions of the pitch and the bowling before attempting to play a shot. Leaving a delivery is a matter of judgement and technique. The batsman still has to watch the ball closely to ensure that it will not hit him or the wicket; he also has to ensure that his bat and hands are kept out of the path of the ball so that it cannot make accidental contact and possibly lead to him being out caught .
Vertical bat strokes[ edit ]
Vertical bat or straight-bat shots can be played either off the front foot or the back foot depending upon the anticipated height of the ball at the moment it reaches the batsman. The characteristic position of the bat is a vertical alignment at point of contact. Vertical bat shots are typically played with the batsman's head directly above the point of contact so that he is able to accurately judge the line of the ball. At this point the bat can either be stationary and facing straight back down the wicket – known as a block or defensive shot; angled to one side – known as a glance or deflection; or travelling forwards towards the bowler – known as a drive.
Defensive shot[ edit ]
Having taken a long stride, a batsman blocks the ball with a forward defensive shot.
A block stroke is usually a purely defensive stroke designed to stop the ball from hitting the wicket or the batsman's body. This shot has no strength behind it and is usually played with a light or "soft" bottom-hand grip and merely stops the ball moving towards the wicket. A block played on the front foot is known as a forward defensive, while that played on the back foot is known as a backward defensive. The application of these strokes may be used to score runs, by manipulating the block to move the ball into vacant portions of the infield, in which case a block becomes a "push". Pushing the ball is one of the more common ways batsmen manipulate the strike.
Leaving and blocking are employed much more often in first-class cricket (including Test matches ), as there is no requirement to score runs as quickly as possible, thus allowing the batsman to choose which deliveries to play.
Ranjitsinhji playing a leg glance, 1897.
Glance[ edit ]
A leg glance is a delicate straight-batted shot played at a ball aimed slightly on the leg side, using the bat to flick the ball as it passes the batsman, and requiring some wrist work as well, deflecting towards the square leg or fine leg area. The stroke involves deflecting the bat-face towards the leg side at the last moment, head and body moving inside the line of the ball. This shot is played "off the toes, shins or hip". It is played off the front foot if the ball is pitched up at the toes or shin of the batsman, or off the back foot if the ball bounces at waist/hip height to the batsman. Although the equivalent term off glance is not employed within cricket, the concept of angling the bat face towards the offside to deflect the ball away from the wicket for the purpose of scoring runs through the off side is a commonly used technique. This would commonly be described instead as "running (or steering) the ball down to third man".

Drive[ edit ]
A drive is a straight-batted shot, played by swinging the bat in a vertical arc through the line of the ball , hitting the ball in front of the batsman along the ground. It is one of the most common shots in a batsman's armoury and often the first shot taught to junior cricketers. Depending on the direction the ball travels, a drive can be a cover drive (struck towards the cover fielding position), an off drive (towards mid-off), straight drive (straight past the bowler), on drive (between stumps and mid-on) or square drive (towards point). A drive can also be played towards midwicket, although the phrase "midwicket drive" is not in common usage. Drives can be played both off the front and the back foot, but back-foot drives are harder to force through the line of the ball. Although most drives are deliberately struck along the ground to reduce the risk of being dismissed caught, a batsman may decide to play a lofted drive in order to hit the ball over the infielders and potentially even over the boundary for six.

Flick[ edit ]
A flick shot is a straight-batted shot played on the leg side by flicking a full-length delivery using the wrists. It is often also called the clip off the legs. The shot is playing with the bat coming through straight as for the on drive, but the bat face is angled towards the leg side. It can be played both off the front foot or the back foot, either off the toes or from the hips. The shot is played between the mid on and square leg region. Typically played along the ground, the flick can also be played by lofting the ball over the infield.
Horizontal bat shots[ edit ]
The second class of cricket stroke are the horizontal bat shots, also known as cross bat shots. These comprise the cut, the square drive, the pull, the hook and the sweep. Typically horizontal bat shots have a greater probability of failing to make contact with the ball than vertical bat shots, and therefore are restricted to deliveries that are not threatening to hit the stumps, either by dint of being too wide or too short. The bat is swung in a horizontal arc, with the batsman's head typically not being perfectly in line with the ball at point of contact.
A batsman plays a cut off the back foot. Note the balance and weight of the batsman is on his back (right) leg.
Cut[ edit ]
A cut is a cross-batted shot played at a short-pitched ball, placing it wide on the off side. The batsman makes contact with the ball as it draws alongside or passes him and therefore requires virtually no effort on his part as he uses the bowler's pace to divert the ball. A square cut is a shot hit into the off side at near to 90 degrees from the wicket (towards point). A late cut, is played as or after the ball passes the batsman's body and is hit towards third man. The cut shot is typically played off the back foot, but is also sometimes played off the front foot against slower bowling. The cut should be played with the face of the bat rolling over the ball to face the ground thus pushing the ball downwards. A mistimed cut with an open-faced bat (with the face of the bat facing the bowler) will generally lead to the ball rising in the air, giving a chance for the batsman to be caught. Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardena is a master class in late cut.
Square drive[ edit ]
Although confusingly named a drive, the square drive is actually a horizontal bat shot, with identical arm mechanics to that of the square cut. The difference between the cut and the square drive is the height of the ball at contact: the cut is played to a ball bouncing waist high or above with the batsman standing tall, whereas the square drive is played to a wide ball of shin height with the batsman bending his knees and crouching low to make contact.
Ricky Ponting playing a pull shot.
Pull and hook[ edit ]
A pull is a cross-batted shot played to a ball bouncing around waist height by swinging the bat in a horizontal arc in front of the body, pulling it around to the leg side towards mid-wicket or square leg. The term hook shot is used when the shot is played against a ball bouncing at or above chest high to the batsman, the batsman thus "hooking" the ball around behind square leg, either along the ground or in the air. Pull and hook shots can be played off front or back foot, with back foot being more typical.
A left-handed batsman plays a sweep shot.
Sweep[ edit ]
A sweep is a cross-batted front foot shot played to a low bouncing ball, usually from a slow bowler , by kneeling on one knee, bringing the head down in line with the ball and swinging the bat around in a horizontal arc near the pitch as the ball arrives, sweeping it around to the leg side, typically towards square leg or fine leg. A paddle sweep shot is a sweep shot in which the ball is deflected towards fine leg with a stationary or near-stationary bat extended horizontally towards the bowler, whereas the hard sweep shot is played towards square leg with the bat swung firmly in a horizontal arc. Typically the sweep shot will be played to a legside delivery, but it is also possible for a batsman to sweep the ball to the legside from outside off stump. Attempting to sweep a full straight delivery on the stumps is generally not recommended because of the risk of lbw .
Unorthodox strokeplay[ edit ]
Since a batsman is free to play any shot to any type of delivery as he wishes, the above list is by no means a complete list of the strokes that batsmen choose to play. Many unorthodox, typically high-risk, shots have been used throughout the history of the game. The advent of limited overs cricket has seen the increased use of unorthodox shots to hit the ball into gaps where there are no fielders placed. Unorthodox shots are rarely used in first-class cricket as the pace of the game is slower and it is relatively more important to keep one's wicket than to try to score runs off every ball.
A few unorthodox shots have gained enough popularity or notoriety to have been given their own names and entered common usage.
Reverse sweep[ edit ]
A reverse sweep is a cross-batted sweep shot played in the opposite direction to the standard sweep, thus instead of sweeping the ball to the leg side, it is swept to the off side, towards backward point or third man. The batsman may also swap his hands on the bat handle to make the stroke easier to execute. The batsman may also bring his back foot to the front therefore making it more like a traditional sweep. The advantage of a reverse sweep is that it effectively reverses the fielding positions and thus is very difficult to set a field to.
It was first regularly played in the 1970s by the Pakistani batsman Mushtaq Mohammad , though Mushtaq's brother Hanif Mohammad is sometimes credited as the inventor. Cricket coach Bob Woolmer has been credited with popularising the stroke. [4] [5]
The most famous example of a reverse sweep backfiring was in the case of Mike Gatting of England against Allan Border of Australia in the 1987 Cricket World Cup final. With England on course for victory Gatting attempted a reverse sweep off the first delivery bowled by Border, top- edged the ball and was caught by wicket-keeper Greg Dyer . England subsequently lost momentum and eventually lost the match.
Because of the unorthodox nature of hand and body position, it is often difficult to get a lot of power behind a reverse sweep; in many situations, the intention is to glance or cut the ball to the backward leg area. However, in rare occasions, players have been able to execute reverse sweeps for a six. Kevin Pietersen , who pioneered switch hitting is adept at this, but one could argue that the resulting shot is basically a sweep rather than a reverse sweep. A more 'classic example' of such a shot would be Yusuf Pathan 's six off Robin Peterson . [6]
Slog and slog sweep[ edit ]
A slog is a powerful pull shot played over mid-wicket, usually hit in the air in an attempt to score a six . A shot would be described as a slog when it is typically played at a delivery that would not ordinarily be pulled. A slog can also be described as hitting the ball to "cow corner". This phrase is designed to imply that the batsman is unsophisticated in his strokeplay and technique by suggesting he would be more at home playing on more rudimentary cricket fields in which there may be cows grazing along the boundary edge. The slog can be an effective shot because all the batsman's power and body weight can be put into swinging the bat at the ball.
A slog sweep is a slog played from the kneeling position used to sweep. Slog sweeps are usually directed over square-leg rather than to mid-wicket. It is almost exclusively used against reasonably full-pitched balls from slow bowlers, as only then does the batsman have time to sight the length and adopt the kneeling position required for the slog sweep. The front leg of the shot is usually placed wider outside leg stump to allow for a full swing of the bat.
Upper cut[ edit ]
An Upper cut is a shot played towards third man, usually hit when the ball is pitched outside the off stump with an extra bounce. It is a dangerous shot which can edge the batsman to keeper or slips if not executed correctly. The shot is hit to the bouncers towards third man area is widely used in modern cricket. The shot is well advantageous in fast bouncy tracks and the shot is seen commonly in twnty20 cricket. The experts of the shot are Virender Sehwag , Sachin Tendulkar , Mahela Jayawardena , and Brendan Taylor .
The latest cricket shot to invented is known as Pericope shot. The shot was introduced by Bangladeshi batsman Soumya Sarkar . While executing this shot, Sarkar moved his body behind the crease, bent himself in the reverse pose, aligned his bat along the path of the ball and directed it towards his desired direction. Well this so called ‘periscope shot’ does have a bit of similarity with the ‘upper cut’ which Virender Sehwag was an expert in playing. As a matter of fact, it might be an improvised version of the upper cut. [7] [8] [9]
Switch hit[ edit ]
A switch hit is a shot where a batsman changes his handedness and posture to adopt a stance the mirror image of his traditional handedness while the bowler is running in to bowl. As a fielding team cannot manoeuvre fielders while the bowler is in his run-up, the fielding side is effectively wrong-footed with the fielders out of position. The shot was pioneered by Kevin Pietersen , first performed off the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan in England's 2006 home series against Sri Lanka. It was subsequently used in the New Zealand series in England in 2008 when Pietersen performed the shot twice in the same innings on his way to making an unbeaten century. David Warner , the Australian opening batsman, is also a frequent user of the switch hit and used it to great effect against the Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin in the first Twenty20 of the Indian cricket team's tour to Australia 2012.
The legality of the switch hit was questioned when first introduced, but cleared by the International Cricket Council as legal. The shot is risky because a batsman is less proficient in the other handedness and is more likely to make a mistake in the execution of his shot.
Scoop / Ramp[ edit ]
A scoop shot (also known as a Ramp shot or Paddle scoop or Marillier shot or Dilscoop ) has been used by a number of first-class batsmen, the first being Dougie Marillier .
It is played to short pitched straight balls that would traditionally be defended or, more aggressively, pulled to the leg side. To play a scoop shot, the batsman is on the front foot and aims to get beneath the bounce of the ball and hit it directly behind the stumps, up and over the wicket keeper. This shot, though risky in the execution, has the advantage of being aimed at a section of the field where a fielder is rarely placed — particularly in Twenty20 and One Day International cricket where the number of outfielders is limited.
However the Marillier shot is played over the batsman's shoulder to fine leg, but the basis of the 'scoop' stroke is for the batsman to go down on one knee to a good length or slightly short-of-length delivery off a fast or medium paced bowler and 'scoop' the ball over the head of the wicket keeper. The 'Scoop' shot is a risky shot to play as the improper execution of this shot may lead to a catch being offered. One famous example of the 'Scoop' backfiring is of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 World Cup final when Pakistan were 152/9 and needed 6 runs off 4 bowls and Misbah-ul-Haq improperly executed this shot resulting in a catch to Sreesanth. A version of the 'Scoop' stroke called the Dilscoop was developed by Sri Lankan right-handed batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan during the ICC World Twenty20 held during June 2009 in England.
Strategy of batting[ edit ]
The fundamental aim of each batsman is to find a means of safely scoring runs against each bowler he faces. In order to do this, the batsman must take into consideration the bowler's strategy, the position of the fielders, the pitch conditions, and his own strengths and weaknesses. The strategy he will decide on will incorporate a number of preconceived attacking responses to the various deliveries he may anticipate receiving, designed specifically to score runs with minimal risk of being dismissed. The success of this strategy will be dependent upon both the accuracy of its conception and the technical ability with which it is carried out. The level of aggression of his strategy will be informed by the target run rate and the calculated risk of losing his wicket, which will be dependent upon the match situation. As such, strategies vary between the three forms of international cricke</sub>   <code></code>   <pre></pre>   <blockquote></blockquote>   <ref></ref> <ref name="" />   {{Reflist}}   <references />   <includeonly></includeonly>   <noinclude></noinclude>   {{DEFAULTSORT:}}   <nowiki></nowiki>   <!-- -->   <span class="plainlinks"></span>

(February 2013)
At the end of the 2012–13 season, Coulter-Nile was awarded the Laurie Sawle Medal as Western Australia's player of the season. [14]
Perth Scorchers[ edit ]
Coulter-Nile was a member of the Perth Scorchers ' 15-man squad for the inaugural 2011–12 season of the franchise-based Big Bash League , which replaced the state-based KFC Twenty20 Big Bash as the Australian domestic Twenty20 competition. [15] The squad was very similar to that of Western Australia, with other fast bowlers including Ryan Duffield , Ben Edmondson , Joe Mennie , and Nathan Rimmington , as well as all-rounders Paul Collingwood and Mitchell Marsh . [16] Having missed the team's first two matches due to concerns over an injured shoulder, [17] Coulter-Nile debuted for Perth in the Scorchers' third match, replacing Shaun Marsh for the game against the Brisbane Heat at the WACA Ground in late December 2011. [18] He went on to play in each of the team's six remaining matches, including in both the semi-final against the Melbourne Stars and the final against the Sydney Sixers . [19] Coulter-Nile finished the season with 10 wickets at an average of 17.40, third in Perth's wicket-taking behind Ben Edmondson (14 wickets) and Brad Hogg (13 wickets). [20] His best bowling figures, 3/9 from three overs, came against the Sydney Thunder in mid-January 2012, at ANZ Stadium [21] Having also effected two run outs during the Thunder's total of 99 all out, he was awarded man of the match . [22]
In July 2012, Coulter-Nile re-signed with the Perth Scorchers for the 2012–13 Big Bash League season . [23] During the Big Bash League offseason, he also played in the team's three matches in the 2012 Champions League Twenty20 . [24] The team's squad for the 2012–13 season differed slightly from the previous season, with Tim Armstrong , Jason Behrendorff , Hilton Cartwright , and Alfonso Thomas replacing Duffield (not contracted), Marsh (injured), and Rimmington ( Melbourne Renegades ) as members of Perth's bowling attack. [25] With Justin Langer having replaced Lachlan Stevens as coach prior to the start of the season, Coulter-Nile began to be used in a different role. Usually bowling three or four overs, often first change behind Thomas and spinner Michael Beer , he took ten wickets at an average of 27.60 from his ten matches, [26] but also usually played as a top-order batsman . This was not entirely a success, given that he scored only 61 runs from his eight innings. [27] However, in a match against Brisbane at The Gabba in mid-December 2012, Coulter-Nile scored 23 not out from just six balls, including 20 runs from four balls in Dan Christian 's final over. [28] With rain necessitating the use of the Duckworth–Lewis method , Perth had been set 51 runs from five overs. [29] Coulter-Nile was named man of the match for his performance, despite having conceded 39 runs from his three overs in Brisbane's innings. [30]
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
At the player auction prior to the 2013 season of the Indian Premier League , Coulter-Nile was sold to the Mumbai Indians for US$ 450,000. [31] Although his reserve price had been $100,000, Mumbai and the Rajasthan Royals (owned by Nita Ambani and Shilpa Shetty , respectively) engaged in a bidding war which eventually raised his price to its final figure. [32] Coulter-Nile played his only match for team in May 2013, against Kings XI Punjab at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala . [33] On debut, he took 1/29 from four overs bowling, and scored nine runs from six balls while batting, with the Indians losing by 50 runs. [34] At the 2014 IPL auction, he was bought by Delhi Daredevils for Rs. 4.25 crores (approximately A$ 750,000).
International career[ edit ]
Following on from his form for Western Australia during the 2011–12 season, Coulter-Nile played two first-class matches for Australia A during the team's 2012 tour of England. [35] Although he had been called up for the tour after James Pattinson withdrew due to an abdominal strain, [36] he played a further match for Australia A in November 2012, against the touring South Africans . [37] After good form in all three formats of the game during the 2012–13 season, Coulter-Nile began to be seriously considered to play for Australia. Following on from his nine-wicket Sheffield Shield performance against Queensland in February 2013, two former internationals— Mike Hussey and Shane Warne —both nominated him as a potential debutant during the ODI and T20I series held towards the end of that season. [38] [39] Coulter-Nile was selected to make his international debut in a T20I against the West Indies later that month. [40] On debut, he took 1/36 from four overs while bowling, and scored 16 not out from 11 balls while batting, including two sixes. [41]
In May 2013, Coulter-Nile was named in Australia's 15-man squad for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy , to be held in England and Wales in June 2013. [42] He played no matches during the tournament, but was selected to tour both India and South Africa with Australia A in the middle of the year. This included a one-day tri-series involving Australia A, India A , and South Africa A , in which Coulter-Nile scoring 104 runs and took two three-wicket hauls in four matches. [43] [44] In one match against South Africa A, he scored 62 runs, which included a partnership of 133 runs for the seventh wicket with Shaun Marsh (136*), and helped Australia A win the match by three wickets. [45] Based on this form, Coulter-Nile was selected in Australia's 18-man senior squad for the ODI and Twenty20 International portions of Australia's 2013 tour of England . [46] In late August, he played his second T20I match. [47] With Australia losing by 27 runs, he failed to take wicket, conceding 47 runs from four overs, but scored 13 runs from six balls while batting, including two sixes. [48]



History[ edit ]
Jammu and Kashmir first took part in the Ranji Trophy in 1959-60. [1] It has always been one of the weaker teams: up to the end of the 2012-13 season it had played 242 matches in the competition and won only 16 times. [2]
In 2013/14, the team qualified for the knockout stage of the Ranji Trophy after a gap of more than 10 years.Placed in Group C, the state team, which last qualified for the knockout stage in 2001-02 season, notched up four outright wins in the league round to pip Goa by .001 points on net run rate for a berth in the quarterfinals.

Mohammad Imran Tahir ( Urdu : محمد عمران طاہر; born 27 March 1979) is a Pakistani -born South African cricketer. A leg break bowler and right-handed batsman , Tahir currently plays for the Highveld Lions in South Africa and played for Hampshire in the 2011 English county cricket season.He also represents Delhi Daredevils in IPL.
As well as his first-class career in Pakistan, Tahir has had short spells with Yorkshire [1] and Middlesex in county cricket as well as playing for Staffordshire in the Minor Counties Cricket Championship .
While Tahir has represented Pakistan Under-19 cricket team 's and Pakistan A, he failed to win full international honours for Pakistan . Tahir is married to Sumayya Dildar, [2] [3] a South African of Indian descent , and has represented South Africa after becoming eligible to play for them when he met his four-year residence requirement in April 2009. [4]
Tahir was a member of Hampshire's 2009 Friends Provident Trophy winning squad, taking 2/50 from 10 overs in the final against Sussex . Tahir made his career high score of 77 not out in a County Championship match against Somerset on 28 August 2009. [5]
For the 2010 season Hampshire signed Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis , replacing Tahir for the season. Tahir represented Warwickshire for the 2010 season, although he is contracted to play for Hampshire from the 2011 season onwards.
Tahir made his 100th first-class appearance in the 2009/2010 SuperSport Series when the Titans played the Lions . On 8 January Tahir was called up to the South Africa squad in their Test series against England although he was then withdrawn one day later after Cricket South Africa revealed that he was not eligible to play. [6]
At the end of the 2009/10 season, Tahir moved from the Titans to the Dolphins. This was due to a lack of first-class cricket with the club, who preferred to play 23-year-old leg-spinner Shaun von Berg . When Tahir was called into South Africa's squad for the final Test against England, national coach Mickey Arthur said "I'm not entirely sure what the issues are between him and the Titans, but the Titans obviously aren't going to pick him because they'd rather pick the young leggie they have". He holds the record for representing highest number of teams (27) in the world. [7] He moved to the Highveld Lions in 2012.

History[ edit ]
CricInfo was launched on 15 March 1993 by Dr Simon King, a British researcher at the University of Minnesota with help from students and researchers at universities around the world. [4] [5]
While a company, CricInfo Ltd, was formed in 1996, CricInfo remained a volunteer-run operation until late 1999 and was not fully staffed until late 2000. The site was reliant on contributions from fans around the world who spent hours compiling electronic scorecards and contributing them to CricInfo's comprehensive archive, as well as keying in live scores from games around the world using CricInfo's scoring software, "dougie". [6] [7] In 2006, Cricinfo's estimated worth was $150 million. [8]
Cricinfo's significant growth in the 1990s made it an attractive site for investors during the peak of the dotcom boom , and in 2000 it received $37 million worth of Satyam Infoway Ltd. shares in exchange for a 25% stake in the company (a valuation of around £100 million). It used around $22m worth of the paper to pay off initial investors but only raised about £6 million by selling the remaining stock. While the site continued to attract more and more users and operated on a very low cost base, its income was not enough to support a peak staff of 130 in nine countries, forcing redundancies .
By late 2002 the company was making a monthly operating profit and was one of very few independent sports sites to avoid collapse (such as Sports.com and Sportal ). However, the business was still servicing a large loan. Cricinfo was eventually acquired by the Paul Getty 's Wisden Group , the publisher of the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and The Wisden Cricketer , and renamed Wisden Cricinfo. The Wisden brand (and its own wisden.com site) were eventually phased out in favor of Cricinfo for Wisden's online operations. In December 2005, Wisden re-launched its recently discontinued Wisden Asia Cricket magazine as Cricinfo Magazine, a magazine dedicated to coverage of Indian cricket. The magazine published its last issue in July 2007.
In 2007, the Wisden Group began to be broken up and sold to other companies; BSkyB acquired The Wisden Cricketer, while Sony Corporation acquired the Hawk-Eye ball tracking system. [9] In June 2007, ESPN Inc. announced that it had acquired Cricinfo from the Wisden Group. [10] The acquisition was intended to help further expand Cricinfo by combining the site with ESPN's other web properties, including ESPN.com and ESPN Soccernet . Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. [11]
Sambit Bal is currently the Editor-in-Chief of ESPNCricinfo. In 2013, EspnCricinfo.com celebrated 20 years of the property with a series of online features. The annual ESPNCricinfo Awards have also become an extremely popular event in the cricket calendar.
Popularity[ edit ]
ESPNcricinfo's popularity was further demonstrated on 24 February 2010, when the site could not handle the heavy traffic experienced after notable Indian player Sachin Tendulkar broke the record for the highest individual score in a One Day International match with 200*. [12] [13]
Features[ edit ]
ESPNcricinfo contains various news , columns , blogs , videos and fantasy sports games. Among its most popular feature are its liveblogs of cricket matches, which includes a bevy of scorecard options, allowing readers to track such aspects of the game as wagon wheels and partnership breakdowns. For each major cricket match, the live scores are accompanied by a Bulletin, which details the turning points of the match and some of the off-field events. The site also used to offer Cricinfo 3D, a feature which utilizes a match's scoring data to generate a 3D animated simulation of a live match. [14]
Regular columns on ESPNcricinfo include "All Today's Yesterdays", an "On this day" column focusing on historical cricket events, and "Quote Unquote", which features notable quotes from cricketers and cricket administrators.
Among its most extensive feature is StatsGuru, a database originally created by Travis Basevi, containing statistics on players, officials, teams, information about cricket boards, details of future tournaments, individual teams, and records.

[48] South Africa won the second Test at Chittagong comprehensively (by an innings and 205 runs) and Steyn returned figures of 4/66 and 3/35 [49] giving him 14 wickets in the series at an average of 12.57 [38] which won him his third consecutive Man-of-the-Series award. When Steyn dismissed Junaid Siddique in Bangladesh's first innings (his 20th match), he claimed the record for the fastest South African to reach 100 wickets in Tests, beating Hugh Tayfield 's record of 21 matches. He holds the record amongst all players who are currently playing Test cricket. [2]
Steyn featured in the final One Day International of the three match series, going wicketless but only giving away 19 runs in 8 overs. [50]
Away Tests against India 2007/08[ edit ]
Coming into the three Test series against India predictions about how Steyn would fare were mixed, with some commentators identifying him a crucial part of a South African team which could pose a serious challenge to India, [51] whilst others predicted he might struggle playing against a strong batting lineup on lifeless subcontinent pitches. [52]
The first Test at Chennai turned out to be a very high scoring affair, with South Africa batting first and making 540, then India responding strongly, led by Virender Sehwag who scored 319 from 304 balls, to reach 468/1 by the end of the third day. On the fourth day Steyn helped to restrict India's lead to 87 runs by dismissing MS Dhoni with a bouncer then blasting through the lower order, taking three wickets in two overs for the cost of two runs, all bowled with reverse swinging deliveries. He finished the innings, and the match which petered out into a tame draw, with four wickets for 103 runs. [53] On the morning of the second Test at Ahmedabad , South Africa demolished the much vaunted Indian batting line within twenty overs, for the meagre total of 76 runs. Steyn was the pick of the bowlers taking five wickets for 23 runs, dismissing Sehwag and Rahul Dravid then mopping up the last three batsmen for the cost of 11 runs. In the second innings he added a further three wickets to his match tally, finishing the game with eight wickets for 114 runs, as South Africa completed a crushing victory by an innings and 90 runs. [54] The final Test at Kanpur saw Steyn pick up three first innings wickets which took him to 15 wickets in the series at an average of 20.20. As a result of this, the cumulation of an outstanding 2007/08 season in which he took 75 wickets in 11 matches, Steyn moved up to joint first place (alongside Muttiah Muralitharan ) in the ICC Test match bowling rankings. [55]
Away Tests against Australia 2008/2009[ edit ]
Steyn fields a ball at practice, Adelaide Oval, January 2009
In the 2nd Test match in a 3 match series, Steyn was involved in a record 9th wicket partnership of 180 with J.P. Duminy . Steyn recorded a score of 76 (191 deliveries) in an innings that helped South Africa recover from 6–141 to post a score of 459. Steyn also starred in the first innings with figures of 5–87 (29.0 overs). [56] In the second innings Steyn returned figures of 5–67 (20.2 overs) and helped South Africa to restrict the Australians to 247 giving the hosts a lead of 183. Steyn now has match figures of 10–154. [57] This is the third time that he has taken 10 wickets in a match in his test career. South Africa duly completed the chase with nine wickets in hand, giving them a 2–0 series lead and their first ever Test series win in Australia. It was also Australia's first home series defeat in 16 years. Steyn was named man of the match for this performance. Dale made a rearguard effort in attempting to prevent an Australian victory in the 3rd Test in Sydney frustrating the hosts with 28 runs in 65 balls in a 50 run partnership from 105 balls with Makhaya Ntini in order to try to secure the draw. However, when he was out with 50 balls to go, injured captain Graeme Smith came in with a broken hand in an attempt to hold out. Smith was eventually bowled out by Mitchell Johnson with ten balls to go.
Away Tests Against West Indies 2010[ edit ]
In the first test against the Windies in the 2010 series, South Africa convincingly beat them, with Steyn take his 200th wicket, Sulimenn Benn , clean bowled (off stump). This was also the wicket that brought Steyn his 14th five – for, a superb achievement considering Steyn's modest record of only 38 tests.
ICC World Cup 2011[ edit ]
Dale Steyn got career best ODI figures of 5 wickets for 50 runs against India in Nagpur during the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup . India had a good start to their batting innings but could not maintain their momentum, in the process losing their final 9 wickets for just 29 runs. Steyn played a vital role in the derailment of a strong Indian batting line-up. [58]
IPL Auction 2011[ edit ]
Dale Steyn was one of the players to go for over a million dollars in the auction for the fourth edition of the Indian Premier League . He was bought by the Deccan Chargers for $1.2 million.
He was awarded the man of the match against Mumbai Indians though Deccan Chargers lost the match.
Playing style[ edit ]
Steyn is an aggressive out-and-out fast bowler capable of bowling at speeds in excess of 150 km/h. He is capable of generating considerable swing and is usually chosen to bowl with the new ball to maximize these attributes. He was a generally aggressive bowler and had capability to even get the ball to do a lot more than it should do. He bowls at mid 140 -150 but likes to bowl at mid 130 at general conditions [59] He has also demonstrated the ability to reverse swing the older ball in a Test match against India in Nagpur in 2010, [60] which South Africa won by an innings and six runs. Steyn is an extremely competitive cricketer and often celebrates vigorously after taking a wicket. He has stated that he "love(s) the buzz from bowling fast" and that he "want(s) to be the quickest in the world". [61]
Steyn is usually considered a tail-ender when batting and usually bats at number nine. However, he is a capable hitter of the ball and can also occupy the crease if required.

In 2009, Twitter was mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter, said Jeremiah Owyang , an industry analyst studying social media. "Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years," he said. [151] According to comScore only eleven percent of Twitter's users are aged twelve to seventeen. [151] comScore attributed this to Twitter's "early adopter period" when the social network first gained popularity in business settings and news outlets attracting primarily older users. However, comScore also stated in 2009 that Twitter had begun to "filter more into the mainstream", and "along with it came a culture of celebrity as Shaq , Britney Spears and Ashton Kutcher joined the ranks of the Twitterati". [152]
According to a study by Sysomos in June 2009, women make up a slightly larger Twitter demographic than men—fifty-three percent over forty-seven percent. It also stated that five percent of users accounted for seventy-five percent of all activity, and that New York City has more Twitter users than other cities. [153]
According to Quancast, twenty-seven million people in the US used Twitter as of September 3, 2009. Sixty-three percent of Twitter users are under thirty-five years old; sixty percent of Twitter users are Caucasian, but a higher than average (compared to other Internet properties) are African American/black (sixteen percent) and Hispanic (eleven percent); fifty-eight percent of Twitter users have a total household income of at least US$60,000. [154] The prevalence of African American Twitter usage and in many popular hashtags has been the subject of research studies. [155] [156]
On September 7, 2011, Twitter announced that it has 100 million active users logging in at least once a month and 50 million active users every day. [157]
In an article published on January 6, 2012, Twitter was confirmed to be the biggest social media network in Japan, with Facebook following closely in second. comScore confirmed this, stating that Japan is the only country in the world where Twitter leads Facebook. [158]
On March 31, 2014, Twitter announced there were 255 million monthly active users (MAUs) and 198 million mobile MAUs. [159] In 2013, there were over 100 million users actively using Twitter daily and about 500 million Tweets every day, [160] with about 29% of users checking Twitter multiple times a day. [161]
In 2012, the country with the most active users on Twitter was the United States. [162]
Finances
Funding
Twitter's San Francisco headquarters located at 1355 Market St.
Twitter raised over US$57 million from venture capitalist growth funding, although exact numbers are not publicly disclosed. Twitter's first A round of funding was for an undisclosed amount that is rumored to have been between US$1 million and US$5 million. [163] Its second B round of funding in 2008 was for US$22 million [164] and its third C round of funding in 2009 was for US$35 million from Institutional Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital along with an undisclosed amount from other investors including Union Square Ventures , Spark Capital , and Insight Venture Partners . [163] Twitter is backed by Union Square Ventures, Digital Garage, Spark Capital, and Bezos Expeditions. [165]
In May 2008, The Industry Standard remarked that Twitter's long-term viability is limited by a lack of revenue. [166] Twitter board member Todd Chaffee forecast that the company could profit from e-commerce , noting that users may want to buy items directly from Twitter since it already provides product recommendations and promotions. [167]
By March 2009 communications consultant Bill Douglass predicted in an interview that Twitter would be worth $1 billion within six months, [168] which came to pass when the company closed a financing round valuing it at $1 billion in September of that year. [169]
The company raised US$200 million in new venture capital in December 2010, at a valuation of approximately US$3.7 billion. [170] In March 2011, 35,000 Twitter shares sold for US$34.50 each on Sharespost, an implied valuation of US$7.8 billion. [171] In August 2010 Twitter announced a "significant" investment led by Digital Sky Technologies that, at US$800 million, was reported to be the largest venture round in history. [172]
In December 2011, the Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal invested $300 million in Twitter. The company was valued at $8.4 billion at the time. [173]
Revenue sources
In July 2009, some of Twitter's revenue and user growth documents were published on TechCrunch after being illegally obtained by Hacker Croll . The documents projected 2009 revenues of US$400,000 in the third quarter and US$4 million in the fourth quarter along with 25 million users by the end of the year. The projections for the end of 2013 were US$1.54 billion in revenue, US$111 million in net earnings, and 1 billion users. [174] No information about how Twitter planned to achieve those numbers was published. In response, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone published a blog post suggesting the possibility of legal action against the hacker. [175]
On April 13, 2010, Twitter announced plans to offer paid advertising for companies that would be able to purchase "promoted tweets" to appear in selective search results on the Twitter website, similar to Google Adwords' advertising model. As of April 13, Twitter announced it had already signed up a number of companies wishing to advertise, including Sony Pictures , Red Bull , Best Buy , and Starbucks . [176] [177]
The company generated US$45 million in annual revenue in 2010, after beginning sales midway through that year; the company operated at a loss through most of 2010. [170]
Users' photos can generate royalty-free revenue for Twitter, and an agreement with World Entertainment News Network (WENN) was announced in May 2011. [178] In June 2011, Twitter announced that it would offer small businesses a self-service advertising system. [179] Twitter generated US$139.5 million in advertising sales during 2011.
The self-service advertising platform was launched in March 2012 to American Express card members and merchants in the U.S. on an invite-only basis. Twitter later reported that numerous small businesses and people who used the self-service tool provided feedback that indicated they were impressed by the feature. [180] To continue their advertising campaign, Twitter announced on March 20, 2012 that promoted tweets would be introduced to mobile devices. [181] In April 2013, Twitter announced that its Twitter Ads self-service platform, consisting of promoted tweets and promoted accounts, was available to all U.S. users without an invite. [180]
Twitter's financial revenue statistics for the first quarter of 2014 was reported as US$250 million. [159]
Technology
Implementation
Twitter places great reliance on open-source software . [182] The Twitter Web interface uses the Ruby on Rails framework, [183] deployed on a performance enhanced Ruby Enterprise Edition implementation of Ruby . [184]
In the early days of Twitter, tweets were stored in MySQL databases that were temporally sharded (large databases were split based on time of posting). After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed re-engineering. [185]
As of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack, to a Java server they call Blender. [6]
From Spring 2007 to 2008 the messages were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling , [186] but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala . [187] The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200–300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost was greater than the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls . [185]
Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called snowflake , and geolocation data is added using 'Rockdove'. The URL shortner t.co then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL. Next, the tweets are stored in a MySQL database using Gizzard , and the user receives acknowledgement that the tweets were sent. Tweets are then sent to search engines via the Firehose API. The process itself is managed by FlockDB and takes an average of 350 ms. [182]
On August 16, 2013, Twitter's Vice President of Platform Engineering Raffi Krikorian shared in a blog post that the company's infrastructure handled almost 143,000 tweets per second during that week, setting a new record. Krikorian explained that Twitter achieved this record by blending its homegrown and open source technologies. [185] [188]
The service's application programming interface (API) allows other web services and applications to integrate with Twitter. [189] [190] The great example of such integration is UK start-up CityFALCON , that aims to provide small and medium investors with financial information. CityFALCON gathers all tweets on financial topic, filters them out (excluding irrelevant news, violent language and spam) and sort out by asser tickers according to its own algorithm.
Interface
On April 30, 2009, Twitter adjusted its web interface, adding a search bar and a sidebar of " trending topics "—the most common phrases appearing in messages. Biz Stone explains that all messages are instantly indexed and that "with this newly launched feature, Twitter has become something unexpectedly important – a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now." [191]
In March 2012, Twitter became available in Arabic , Farsi , Hebrew and Urdu , the first right-to-left language versions of the site. About 13,000 volunteers helped with translating the menu options. [192] In August 2012, beta support for Basque , Czech and Greek was added, making the site available in 33 different languages. [193]
Outages
The Twitter fail whale error message .
When Twitter experiences an outage, users once saw the "fail whale" error message image created by Yiying Lu, [194] illustrating eight orange birds using a net to hoist a whale from the ocean captioned "Too many tweets! Please wait a moment and try again." [195] In a November 2013 WIRED interview Chris Fry, VP of Engineering at that time, noted that the company had taken the "fail whale" out of production as the platform was now more stable.
Twitter had approximately ninety-eight percent uptime in 2007 (or about six full days of downtime). [196] The downtime was particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference & Expo keynote address . [197] [198]
May 2008: Twitter's new engineering team made architectural changes to deal with the scale of growth. Stability issues resulted in down time or temporary feature removal.
August 2008: Twitter withdrew free SMS services from users in the United Kingdom [199] and for approximately five months instant messaging support via a XMPP bot was listed as being "temporarily unavailable". [200]
October 10, 2008: Twitter's status blog announced that instant messaging (IM) service was no longer a temporary outage and needed to be revamped. It was announced that Twitter aims to return its IM service pending necessary major work. [201]
June 12, 2009: In what was called a potential "Twitpocalypse", the unique numerical identifier associated with each tweet exceeded the limit of 32-bit signed integers (2,147,483,647 total messages). [202] While Twitter itself was not affected, some third-party clients could no longer access recent tweets. Patches were quickly released, though some iPhone applications had to wait for approval from the App Store . [203]
June 25, 2009: Twitter ran slowly for some time after over 50,000 tweets on Michael Jackson 's death were recorded in an hour. [204]
August 6, 2009: Twitter and Facebook suffered from a denial-of-service attack , causing the Twitter website to go offline for several hours. [205] It was later confirmed that the attacks were directed at one pro-Georgian user around the anniversary of the 2008 South Ossetia War , rather than the sites themselves. [206]
September 22, 2009: The identifier exceeded the limit for 32-bit unsigned integers (4,294,967,296 total messages) again breaking some third-party clients. [207]
December 17, 2009: A hacking attack replaced the website's welcoming screen with an image of a green flag and the caption "This site has been hacked by Iranian Cyber Army " for nearly an hour. No connection between the hackers and Iran has been established. [208]
June–July 2010: Twitter had a very high service rejection rate (10–20%) during the 2010 FIFA World Cup period, also, the response latency increased substantially. [209]
November 2010: A number of accounts encountered a fault that resulted in them seeing the "fail whale" when they tried to login to their accounts. The accounts themselves were not locked out as account holders could still see their "mentions" page, and post from there, but the timeline and a number of other features were unavailable during this outage.
June 21, 2012: The site was down for around one hour and forty minutes, with the cause being described by Twitter as a "cascading bug". [210]
July 26, 2012: Twitter users in the UK could not post messages for part of the day in advance of the 2012 Summer Olympics . [211]
March 2, 2014 - During the 86th Academy Awards , Ellen DeGeneres posted a selfie of herself and other celebrities as seen on the telecast, which shut down Twitter for more than 20 minutes. [212]
Privacy and security
Twitter messages are public, but users can also send private messages. [213] Information about who has chosen to follow an account and who a user has chosen to follow is also public, though accounts can be changed to "protected" which limits this information (and all tweets) to approved followers. [214] Twitter collects personally identifiable information about its users and shares it with third parties as specified in its privacy policy . The service also reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands. [215] While Twitter displays no advertising, advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads [216] directed specifically to the user.
A security vulnerability was reported on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used the phone number of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing . [217] The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account. Within a few weeks of this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages. [218]
On January 5, 2009, 33 high-profile Twitter accounts were compromised after a Twitter administrator's password was guessed by a dictionary attack . [219] Falsified tweets—including sexually explicit and drug-related messages—were sent from these accounts. [220]
Twitter launched the beta version of their "Verified Accounts" service on June 11, 2009, allowing famous or notable people to announce their Twitter account name. The home pages of these accounts display a badge indicating their status. [221]
In May 2010, a bug was discovered by İnci Sözlük that could allow a Twitter user to force others to follow them without the other users' consent or knowledge. For example, comedian Conan O'Brien 's account, which had been set to follow only one person, was changed to receive nearly 200 malicious subscriptions. [222]
In response to Twitter's security breaches, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought charges against the service; the charges were settled on June 24, 2010. This was the first time the FTC had taken action against a social network for security lapses. The settlement requires Twitter to take a number of steps to secure users' private information, including maintenance of a "comprehensive information security program" to be independently audited biannually. [223]
On December 14, 2010, the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks . [224] Twitter decided to notify its users and said in a statement, "... it's our policy to notify users about law enforcement and governmental requests for their information, unless we are prevented by law from doing so." [213]
A "MouseOver" exploit occurred on September 21, 2010, when an XSS Worm became active on Twitter. When a user held the mouse cursor over blacked-out parts of a tweet, the worm within the script would automatically open links and re-post itself on the reader's account. [225] The exploit was then re-used to post pop-up ads and links to pornographic sites. The origin of the worm is unclear, but Pearce H. Delphin (known on Twitter as @zzap) and a Scandinavian developer, Magnus Holm, both claim to have modified a related exploit found by another user (possibly Masato Kinugawa) who was using it to create coloured Tweets. [226] Kinugawa, a Japanese developer, reported the XSS vulnerability to Twitter on August 14. Later, when he found it was exploitable again, he created the account 'RainbowTwtr' and used it to post coloured messages. [226] Delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a JavaScript function for "onMouseOver", [226] and Holm later created and posted the XSS Worm that automatically re-tweeted itself. [225] Security firm Sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for "fun and games", but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals. [225] Twitter issued a statement on their status blog at 13:50 UTC that "The exploit is fully patched." [225] [227] Twitter representative Carolyn Penner said no charges would be pressed. [228]
In May 2011, a claimant known as "CTB" (subsequently identified as Ryan Giggs ) in the case of CTB v Twitter Inc., Persons Unknown took legal action at the High Court of Justice in London against Twitter, [229] requesting that Twitter release details of account holders. This followed gossip posted on Twitter about Giggs' private life, causing conflict relating to privacy injunctions . [230] [231] Tony Wang, the head of Twitter in Europe, said that people who do "bad things" on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy, and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so. [232] He also suggested that Twitter would accede to a UK court order to divulge names of users responsible for "illegal activity" on the site. [233]
On May 29, 2011, it was reported that South Tyneside council in England had successfully taken legal action against Twitter in a court in California, forcing Twitter to reveal the details of five user accounts. The council was trying to discover the identity of a blogger called "Mr Monkey" [234] who allegedly posted libellous statements about three local councillors. [235]
On January 23, 2012, it was reported that Twitter would be acquiring Dasient , a startup that offers malware protection for businesses. Twitter announced plans to use Dasient to help remove hateful advertisers on the website. [236]
On January 26, 2012, Twitter began offering a feature which would allow tweets to be removed selectively by country. Twitter cited France and Germany as examples, where pro- Nazi content is illegal. Previously, deleted tweets were removed in all countries. [237] [238] The first use of the policy was to block the account of German neo-Nazi group Besseres Hannover  ( de ) on October 18, 2012. [239] The policy was used again the following day to remove anti-Semitic French tweets with the hashtag #unbonjuif ("a good Jew"). [240]
On February 20, 2012, a third-party public-key encryption app (written in Python and partially funded by a grant from the Shuttleworth Foundation [241] ) for private messaging in Twitter, CrypTweet, was released. [242]
On May 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement the " Do Not Track " privacy option, a cookie -blocking feature found in Mozilla 's Firefox browser. The "Do Not Track" feature works only on sites that have agreed to the service. [243]
In August 2012 it was reported that there is a market in fake Twitter followers that are used to increase politicians' and celebrities' apparent popularity. [244] The black market for the fake followers, known as "bots", has been linked to "nearly every politically linked account from the White House to Congress to the 2016 campaign trail". In June 2014, POLITICO analyzed Twitter handles with the highest rates of fake followers: US President Barack Obama with 46.8 percent, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz with 35.1 percent, and Senator John McCain with 23.6 percent. The culprits working to generate the fake followers, or "bots", include campaign workers or friends of political candidates. One site offers 1,000 fake followers for $20. The people creating the "bots" are often from Eastern Europe and Asia . [245] [246] In 2013, two Italian researchers calculated 10 percent of total accounts on Twitter are "bots" however, other estimates have placed the figure even higher. [247]
In April 2013 Twitter warned news organizations around the world to secure their Twitter accounts after a number of high-profile hacks of official accounts, including those of the Associated Press and The Guardian. [248] In May 2013, Twitter announced a two-factor login verification as an added measure against hacking. [249]
In August 2013, Twitter announced plans to introduce a "report abuse" button for all versions of the site. A petition for making the process of complaining about harassment easier had collected over 100,000 signatures. The move followed the posting of abusive tweets, including rape and death threats to historian Mary Beard , British feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and the British MP Stella Creasy . [250] [251] [252] Three men were arrested under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in connection with the incidents. [253]
In August 2014, Twitter said that in certain cases it would delete pictures of people who had died after requests from family members and "authorized individuals". The move followed controversy over the sharing of images on Twitter showing the killing of American journalist James Foley . [254] [255]
In December 2014 Twitter announced new reporting and blocking policies; [256] [257] [258] [259] a blocking mechanism devised by Randi Harper, a target of GamerGate , also received notable coverage. [260] [261] [262]
In February 2015, in an internal Twitter memo, CEO Dick Costolo said he was 'frankly ashamed' at how poorly Twitter handled trolling and abuse, and admitted Twitter had lost users as a result. [263]
Per an updated terms of service and privacy policy, Twitter users outside of the United States are legally served by the Ireland -based Twitter International Company instead of Twitter Inc., effective May 18, 2015. The change make these users subject to Irish and European data protection laws. [264]
Open source
Twitter has a history of both using and releasing open source software while overcoming technical challenges of their service. [265] A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open source projects which they have used, from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala. [266] Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB , the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS , and the Bower client-side package manager. [267] [268] The popular Twitter Bootstrap web design library was also started at Twitter and is the most popular repository on GitHub . [269]
Innovators patent agreement
On April 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement an "Innovators Patent Agreement" which would obligate Twitter to only use its patents for defensive purposes. The agreement went into effect in 2012. [270]
URL shortener
t.co is a URL shortening service created by Twitter. [125] It is only available for links posted to Twitter and not available for general use. [125] All links posted to Twitter use a t.co wrapper. [271] Twitter hopes that the service will be able to protect users from malicious sites, [125] and will use it to track clicks on links within tweets. [125] [272]
Having previously used the services of third parties TinyURL and bit.ly , [273] Twitter began experimenting with its own URL shortening service for private messages in March 2010 using the twt.tl domain, [271] before it purchased the t.co domain. The service was tested on the main site using the accounts @TwitterAPI, @rsarver and @raffi. [271] On September 2, 2010, an email from Twitter to users said they would be expanding the roll-out of the service to users. On June 7, 2011, Twitter announced that it was rolling out the feature. [126]
Integrated photo-sharing service
On June 1, 2011, Twitter announced its own integrated photo-sharing service that enables users to upload a photo and attach it to a Tweet right from Twitter.com. [274] Users now also have the ability to add pictures to Twitter's search by adding hashtags to the tweet. [275] Twitter also plans to provide photo galleries designed to gather and syndicate all photos that a user has uploaded on Twitter and third-party services such as TwitPic. [275]
Twitterbots
A Twitterbot is a computer program that automatically posts on Twitter, they are programmed to tweet, retweet, and follow other accounts. According to a recent report, there were 20 million, fewer than 5%, of accounts on Twitter that were fraudulent in 2013. These fake accounts are often used to build large follower populations quickly for advertisers, while others respond to tweets that include a certain word or phrase. [276] Twitter's wide-open application programming interface and cloud servers make it possible for twitterbots' existence within the social networking site. [277]

India in Bangladesh 2009-10 January 11, 2010
India confirm Simons as bowling consultant

The South African presence in the Indian coaching bench has gained further weight after the BCCI today appointed Eric Simons , the former South Africa coach, as bowling consultant for the upcoming Test series against Bangladesh, and the Test and ODI series at home against South Africa that follow.
It has been learned that Simons spoke to Gary Kirsten, India's coach, last week and that was the first occasion he learned of the management's interest in him. Simon's appointment comes after former South African fast bowler Allan Donald's name cropped up last Tuesday, as one of the contenders for the vacant bowling coach position.
MS Dhoni, India's captain, recently admitted that the absence of a specialist bowling coach is hurting the team's performance. It was no understatement, because the inconsistency in the fast bowling department has remained a concern right from the World Twenty20. In England, Zaheer Khan had aggravated the shoulder injury he picked during the IPL in South Africa. His inability to go full throttle exposed the younger lot like Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar, and though Ashish Nehra was around he was just finding his own feet, having made a return after a long time. Things did not improve during the Champions Trophy, and India's problems were exacerbated during the home ODI series against Australia, which they lost 4-2.
During the recently concluded Sri Lanka series the Indian fast bowlers were lukewarm even if they improved on their death bowling, and in the current tri-series in Bangladesh they have been disappointing. They failed to defend a total of 279 against Sri Lanka and allowed Bangladesh to post 296.
The 47-year-old Simons, who played 23 one-day internationals for South Africa and toured New Zealand in 1995, has a rich pedigree in the coaching profession and was South Africa's head coach from 2002-2004, a period when Kirsten played under him. Simons spread his first-class career, mostly with Western Province, over 17 seasons as a right-arm medium pacer and a handy lower middle order batsman.
He has never had any experience as a bowling coach except for the brief stint in the second IPL in South Africa last year, where he worked as a consultant with Royal Challengers Bangalore. Simons has worked in various capacities at the prestigious High Performance Centre in Pretoria along with the likes of Kepler Wessels.

(born 14 December 1962, Vijayawada , Andhra Pradesh ) was an Indian Test cricketer .
The bearded Arun was a medium pacer and an attacking lower order batsman. In the semifinal of the 1986/87 Duleep Trophy he hit 149 and added 221 for the seventh wicket with W. V. Raman as South Zone chased a West total of 516 for the first innings lead [1] . A 107* for India Under-25 against the visiting Sri Lankans just before the selection of the side for the Tests against Sri Lanka won him a place in the side. He was part of the Indian under 19 team that toured Sri Lanka in 1979 under the captaincy of Ravi Shastri.
He played two Test matches of the series with the 3 for 76 in his first match as his best bowling figures (after slipping and falling down, to some hilarity, when he ran in to bowl his first ball). He toured Sharjah in 1987 and appeared in all of India's three matches without distinction. He was a part of the Tamil Nadu team that won the Ranji Trophy in 1987/88.

Calculation[ edit ]
A cricketer's bowling average is calculated by dividing the numbers of runs they have conceded by the number of wickets they have taken. [2] The number of runs conceded by a bowler is determined as the total number of runs that the opposing side have scored while the bowler was bowling, excluding any byes , leg byes , [3] or penalty runs . [4] The bowler receives credit for any wickets taken during their bowling that are either bowled , caught , hit wicket , leg before wicket or stumped . [5]
A number of flaws have been identified for the statistic, most notable among these the fact that a bowler who has taken no wickets can not have a bowling average, as dividing by zero does not give a result. The effect of this is that the bowling average can not distinguish between a bowler who has taken no wickets and conceded one run, and a bowler who has taken no wickets and conceded one hundred runs. The bowling average also does not tend to give a true reflection of the bowler's ability when the number of wickets they have taken is small, especially in comparison to the number of runs they have conceded. [6] In his paper proposing an alternative method of judging batsmen and bowlers, Paul van Staden gives an example of this:
Suppose a bowler has bowled a total of 80 balls, conceded 60 runs and has taken only 2 wickets so that.. [their average is] 30. If the bowler takes a wicket with the next ball bowled (no runs obviously conceded), then [their average is] 20. [6]
Due to this, when establishing records for bowling averages, qualification criteria are generally set. For Test cricket , the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack sets this as 75 wickets, [7] while ESPNcricinfo requires 2,000 deliveries . [8] Similar restrictions are set for one-day cricket . [9] [10]
Variations[ edit ]
A number of factors other than purely the ability level of the bowler have an effect on a player's bowling average. Most significant among these are the different eras in which cricket has been played. The bowling average tables in Test and first-class cricket are headed by players who competed in the nineteenth century, [11] a period when pitches were uncovered and some were so badly looked after that they had rocks on them. Other factors which provided an advantage to bowlers in that era was the lack of significant safety equipment ; batting gloves and helmets were not worn, and batsmen had to be warier. Other variations are caused by frequent matches against stronger or weaker opposition, changes in the laws of cricket and the length of matches. [12] The bowlers competing in the Howa Bowl , a competition played in South African during the apartheid-era, restricted to non-white players, [13] during which time, according to Vincent Barnes : "Most of the wickets we played on were underprepared. For me, as a bowler, it was great." [14]



Early days[ edit ]
Shastri's ancestral origins are from Mangalore . [7] [8] This family has been reported to have had its ancestral temple, the Shri Vishnumurti Temple in the village Karvalu, a small village in the Yarlapadi in Karkala taluk. [9] He was born and brought up in Bombay. His father, M. Jayadratha Shastri, was a medical doctor; whose father was Dr M C Shastri, a well-known Ayurvedic physician of Mangalore. This family is reportedly known as a family of physicians, [10] and had a strong academic tradition. [11] His mother, Prof. Laksmi Shashtri was a professor in National college, Bandra. [12] Shastri studied at Don Bosco High School, Matunga . It was only as a teenager that he took to cricket seriously. Shastri, playing for Don Bosco (Matunga), reached the final of the 1976 inter-school Giles Shield, losing to St Mary's, whose lineup included two future Ranji players, Shishir Hattangadi and Jignesh Sanghani. The next year, under Shastri's captaincy, Don Bosco won the Giles Shield in 1977, the first time in the history of this school. [13] At school, his coach was BD Desai, once a Tatas and Dadar Union player. While Don Bosco was not traditionally a major force in schools cricket, the R.A. Podar College , where Shastri later studied commerce , produced many good cricketers. Vasant Amladi and, in particular, VS "Marshall" Patil, were integral figures in Shastri's development as a cricketer. In his last year at the junior college, he was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji trophy. [14] At 17 years and 292 days, he was then the youngest cricketer to play for Bombay.
Ravi Shastri's career performance graph
An Indian under–19 team was scheduled to tour Pakistan in 1980–81. Shastri was included in the coaching camp at the last minute by the National Coach Hemu Adhikari . Shastri captained one of the two teams in a trial game and was then asked to lead the Indian Under-19 team. The tour, however, was cancelled. The team later went to Sri Lanka, but the games were frequently interrupted by rain. [15]
His only notable achievement in his first two Ranji seasons were bowling figures of 6-61, which he took against Delhi in the 1979–80 Ranji final that Bombay lost. While he was playing against Uttar Pradesh at Kanpur in the next season, he was called up to the squad touring New Zealand to stand in for the injured left arm spinner Dilip Doshi . Shastri arrived in Wellington the night before the first Test. His first over in Test cricket was a maiden to the New Zealand captain Geoff Howarth . In the second innings, he took 3 wickets in four balls, all to catches by Dilip Vengsarkar , to bring a quick close to the New Zealand innings. In the third Test, his seven wickets won him the man of the match award, while his 15 wickets in the series were the highest for either side.
International cricket[ edit ]
Within eighteen months of his Test debut, Shastri had moved up from tenth position in the batting order to being an opening batsman. "His calm, sensible batting lower in the order", wrote Wisden , commenting on his first series, [16] "raised promise of his developing into a useful all-rounder, and his fielding too was an asset". By the end of his career, he had batted in every position from one to ten. By his own admission, [14] he ignored his bowling in favour of his batting. This was reflected in his performances. However, his figures of 9-101 in the season-opening 1981 Irani Trophy stood as a tournament record for nearly twenty years.
It was the failure of the regular openers Pranab Roy and Ghulam Parkar that led to Shastri being made to open at the Oval against England in 1982. He distinguished himself by scoring 66 runs in that match. An injury in the webbing of his hand ruled him out of four of the Tests to be played in Pakistan. Forced again to open in the final Test at Karachi , against the fast bowling of Imran Khan (then at the peak of his career), he scored his first Test hundred. He later made another hundred against the West Indies in Antigua . Indian Cricket was impressed enough to suggest that, given time, he could become one of the best batsmen in the Indian team. [17]
Shastri was not selected to play in most of the important matches in the 1983 World Cup . In the series against the West Indies later that year, he again distinguished himself with his bold effort in batting against the domineering West Indian pace bowlers.
The glorious winter[ edit ]
In October 1984, India toured Pakistan for the third time in six years. The Lahore Test saw India collapse to 156 against Pakistan 's 428, and follow on . India went into the last day trailing by 92 with six wickets in hand but were saved by a fifth wicket partnership of 126 between Shastri and Mohinder Amarnath . Shastri scored 71, while Amarnath made 101*. Shastri was even more successful in the next Test at Faisalabad , where he scored 139 and shared a stand of 200 with Sandip Patil . The last Test and the remainder of the tour were cancelled because of the assassination of Indira Gandhi .
There were already signals that Shastri was being groomed as a future captain. Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar was coming to the end of his career and Kapil Dev , who had led India in the previous season, was expected to succeed him. Shastri appeared to be the next in line. He led the Young India side to Zimbabwe in early 1984. Against the touring English side in November, he led the India Under–25 to an innings win - the first defeat of England in a tour match in India for fifty years.
Around this time, Shastri also began to open the innings regularly in one day games . He scored 102 against Australia in October – India 's second hundred in ODIs – and made the same score against England at Cuttack in December. Shastri had stood in for Gavaskar and opened with Srikkanth in two matches of the 1983 World Cup . The third time that they opened was at Cuttack and they set a world record of 188 for the first wicket. Later in the season, this partnership was to form the foundation for the Indian triumph in the WCC in Australia.
Shastri's success continued in Test matches against England. In the Bombay Test his 235 run stand with wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani led to victory for India. His 142 improved upon the 139 at Faisalabad as his highest score.
In the third Test at Calcutta , Shastri made 111 in 357 balls and 455 minutes, though his innings was heavily interrupted by rain. With Mohammad Azharuddin he added 214 for the fifth wicket, another Indian record. When India started the second innings late in the final day, he was sent in to open, thus becoming one of the few batsmen to bat on all five days of a Test.
Shastri set another record for Bombay against Baroda in a West Zone Ranji match. His first hundred came up in 72 minutes and 80 balls and included nine fours and four sixes. The second took just 41 minutes and 43 balls. His 123 ball, 113 minute 200* became the fastest double hundred in first class history, beating the previous record by 7 minutes, and included 13 fours and 13 sixes. Six of the sixes came off a single over of the left arm spinner Tilak Raj . In terms of the number of sixes, it bettered the 58-year-old Indian record of CK Nayudu who had struck 11 sixes against a touring MCC team at Bombay Gymkhana in 1926–7. Shastri's unfinished sixth wicket stand of 204* with Ghulam Parkar, who contributed only 33 to the partnership, took only 83 minutes. In Baroda's second innings, Shastri took two wickets in four overs. [18]
'The Champion of Champions'[ edit ]
Except for a few series in Pakistan and the 1983 World Cup final, the World Championship of Cricket in Australia was the first time overseas cricket matches were shown live in India. The WCC saw India win every match convincingly. The WCC was conceived as a celebration of the 150th year of the formation of Victoria , but the finalists turned out to be India and Pakistan. [18] [19]
Shastri had a slow start to the tournament but finished with fifties in the last three matches. Srikkanth too scored three fifties and India posted century opening stands against Australia and in the final. India went in with two spinners for every match. It helped that all the matches were played at Melbourne and Sydney which have turning tracks and long boundaries. Sivaramakrishnan and Shastri claimed 18 wickets between them in five matches.
For his 182 runs and 8 wickets, Shastri was chosen as the man of the series which in this tournament was called 'The Champion of Champions'. He won an Audi 100 car for his efforts. By the special order of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi , Indian customs waived the heavy duty its import would have normally entailed. [20]
Two weeks later India won the Rothman's cup in Sharjah beating Pakistan and Australia. The victory against Pakistan was particularly memorable because India defended a total of only 125. Shastri and Siva continued their successful partnership with the ball. It was for this tournament that Shastri served as the Indian vice captain for the first time. Gavaskar had announced his decision to resign his captaincy at the end of the WCC before the tournament began. [21] Before the final, former Australian captain Ian Chappell suggested that for the good of Indian cricket, Gavaskar should continue as the captain till Shastri could take over from him. [22]
The Ranji final[ edit ]
The Ranji final of 1984/85 turned out to be one of the finest matches in Indian domestic cricket history. A sleepy Gavaskar won the toss and batted. He could hardly close his eyes before Bombay was 3 down for 42. Batting at No.5, he scored his 20th and last hundred in Ranji trophy and took Bombay to 333. Shastri made 29 before he was bowled attempting to cut an arm–ball . Delhi was in early trouble before they were rescued by Chetan Chauhan , batting with a fractured finger in his last first class match. Ajay Sharma , in his first season, scored a hundred and took Delhi into the lead with nine wickets down.
The rules of the competition specified that in the event of a draw, the team with the first innings lead would be declared the winners. With two days and 100 minutes left, Bombay went for quick runs. A crowd of about 46,000 turned up for match on the fourth day and the organizers ran out of tickets. Shastri top scored with 76 as Bombay set Delhi 300 to win in a day and ninety minutes.
Except for the odd delivery, the ball spun slowly and afforded enough time for the batsmen to play their strokes. Early on the final day, Delhi reached 95 for no loss and then collapsed. His first wicket was Chauhan who was declared out caught behind with the ball having spun across the face of the bat without apparently touching it. The match changed dramatically and the batsmen lost their head. Gursharan Singh was lbw playing no stroke, Kirti Azad played on, Surinder Khanna was stumped after a few slogs. Shastri took 8 for 91; Bombay won by 90 runs. In the 50th year of Ranji trophy, it was their 30th title. [23]
The slow descent[ edit ]
Shastri continued as vice captain to Kapil Dev in the 1985–86 season. This season and the England tour of 1986 were ordinary ones for him. After the tour of Australia in 1985–86, he also began to decline as a bowler. Bombay lost to Haryana in the semifinal of the Ranji trophy but West Zone won the Duleep Trophy . His major contribution was as a bowler in the semifinal against North Zone on a flat wicket at Trivandrum. Like in the Ranji final, North looked the likely winner going into the last day, before he took 8 for 145.
Australia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan toured India in 1986–87. Shastri played a crucial role in the Tied Test at Madras against Australia , scoring 62 and 48*. When Indian middle order collapsed and India fell behind the run rate, his two sixes in quick succession off off–spinner Greg Matthews came in handy. In the final Test at Bombay he scored 121*. As was becoming increasingly common, it was played in first and fourth gear. He hung around for around 30 minutes for the last run for his fifty and twice as long in the nineties. Yet he hit six sixes, three of which came after he completed his hundred. The huge six off left arm fast bowler Bruce Reid – a cross batted heave that went over longon – was particularly memorable. Six sixes in an innings was an Indian record at the time. But he was outshone by Dilip Vengsarkar who scored 164* in the same innings. They added a record 298* for the sixth wicket.
He scored hundreds in the quarter final and semifinal of the Duleep trophy, but West Zone lost to South on first innings lead in the latter match. Shastri's only other score over fifty in the season was a particularly dull 125 against Pakistan in the Jaipur Test. He did well enough to be the man of the one day series. In the first one-day match against Pakistan he captained India for the first time, scoring 50 and taking three wickets. He took four wickets at Calcutta and 69* at Hyderabad in two thrilling finishes. Later at Nagpur with India facing a big target, he scored 52 in 40 balls.
In early 1987, he presented a 15-minute coaching series which went by the name 'That's Cricket'. This was aired on the national channel Doordarshan on Sunday mornings. There were even rumours of an involvement with actress Amrita Singh . [24]
County cricket[ edit ]
In 1987, Glamorgan contracted Shastri to play for them. He stayed with them until 1991, with a break in 1990 due to India's tour of England. Shastri's presence did little for the fortunes of the county which finished at the bottom of the first class table in two of those seasons. Shastri topped 1000 runs in 1989 and scored hundreds in both innings against Middlesex . His best bowling performance of 7 for 49 (11 for 90) in the match came against Lancashire in 1988, where he got bounce and turn and was 'unplayable' according to Wisden. The almanack noticed that Shastri was already becoming reluctant to bowl.
1988 was by far the best of the seasons for Glamorgan in one day matches. They finished 5th in the Sunday League – up from 14 in 1987 – and reached the semifinal of the Benson & Hedges Cup. Shastri won the leading six hitter award for the Sunday league matches of 1988 with 14 sixes. He was part of the MCC team that played a Rest of the World team in the MCC bicentennial match at Lord's in 1987.
Always the bridesmaid[ edit ]
India lost the final Test at Bangalore to lose the 1986–87 series against Pakistan. Kapil Dev was widely cricticised in the media for his captaincy. The selectors retained him as captain in the Reliance World Cup at the beginning of the 1987–88 season. Shastri failed with the bat in the Reliance Cup but formed a successful bowling partnership with Maninder Singh , another left arm spinner. India topped its group but went down to England in the semifinal. Kapil Dev received more cricticisms for skying a catch to deep midwicket when a win was still a possibility.
About this time, Vengsarkar emerged as the strongest candidate to take over from Kapil. He had had a dream run with the bat, starting from the series in England in 1986. In 1987, the newly established Deloitte ratings (the forerunner of the current LG ratings) ranked him the best batsman in the world. The Indian selectors have conventionally leaned towards making the best player of the team the captain. So before the home series against West Indies , Kapil was sacked and Vengsarkar was made the Indian captain.
Vengsarkar had his left arm fractured in the third Test and Shastri captained India for the only time in his Test career. On an underprepared turning track in Madras, India won the toss and elected to bat first. Debutant Narendra Hirwani took 16 for 136 as India won by 255 runs to draw the series 1–1. Apart from this, Shastri did little with bat or ball. West Indies won 7 of the eight one day matches, he was the captain in six of them. Vengsarkar meanwhile picked up a six-month ban from BCCI for writing newspaper columns. So Shastri continued as the captain for a three nations tournament in Sharjah in April. Sri Lanka and New Zealand were the other teams and India won easily.
India travelled to West Indies in early 1989. Though a failure overall, Shastri played the best innings by either side in the series. It came at Bridgetown in the second Test. India trailed by 56 in the first innings and lost the six second innings wickets for 63. Batting at No.3, Shastri was last out for a courageous 107 out of 251 allout. Looking back at the end of the his career, he was to consider this his finest innings. [25] The bowlers were Malcolm Marshall , Curtly Ambrose , Courtney Walsh and Ian Bishop and the pitch, difficult.
On the way back many of the Indian players took part in an exhibition match in USA . BCCI suspended the players. Though the suspension was later revoked, Vengsarkar was sacked. Srikkanth became the new captain and Shastri, yet again, the deputy. After an indifferent series in Pakistan, both were excluded from the tour of New Zealand in 1990. Azharuddin led an experimental team which a selector called the 'team of the nineties'. Within a few weeks, the phrase got the status of a joke. Shastri was recalled for the tour to England that summer as the vice-captain.
The Indian summer[ edit ]
Since 1985, Shastri's career had been in steady decline but he was able to turn it around in 1990. The pitches in England were good for batting and he scored two hundreds in the three Tests. He was now back as an opener. While India faced a huge England score at Lord's, he scored an exact hundred. It wasn't a faultless innings – too often he played and missed and most of the runs came with his usual flicks and nudges. He went to his hundred hitting the English spinner Eddie Hemmings for two fours and a six in an over, and departed immediately attempting another big hit.
He topped this with 187 at the Oval. Journalist and commentator Harsha Bhogle 's description of this innings holds true for many of Shastri's major efforts: [26]
Watching Shastri bat is like admiring the Qutub Minar ; tall, timeless, solid. You admire it for the virtues, not for its style. For nine hours and 21 minutes, he chiselled away the England attack and the sculpture that he left behind represented perseverance and craft. There was the usual stoic, expressionless face under the helmet, but you could see the determination in his eyes as he planted himself at the wicket, struck root and bore fruit.
Only occasionally, the bat wavered in its resolve but the mind put it on the right path again, almost in admonishment, and the bat grew broader and straighter ... He may never be a Gavaskar, but he at least represents the great man's virtues, even if by proxy. It would be a relief too, to know that he will never throw away his wicket for nobody guards his crease more fiercely.
Following the innings at Oval, Shastri scored his career best score of 217 in the Irani trophy in the opening match of the Indian season and a top score of 88 on a very bad wicket in the Chandigarh Test against Sri Lanka. He carried his bat for 101* against the same opponents in a one-day match a week later, reaching the hundred with a two off the last ball. Next year in South Africa's first-ever ODI series on their return to international cricket, he scored 109 at Delhi, his fourth and last one day hundred. A series of abandoned tours meant India played few matches at home at this time.
At the end of 1991, India travelled to Australia for a five Test series, to be followed by the World Cup. Channel 9 dubbed it the Indian Summer. The series was a disaster for India – they lost four of the Tests – and was rife with umpiring controversies. But it also saw the final flourishes in the careers of Shastri and Kapil Dev.
Shastri took 5 wickets for 15 runs against Australia in an early match in the World Series Cup. It was then the best bowling figures by an Indian in ODIs . Most of the wickets were gratuitously earned, though – three batsmen were caught on the legside boundary and another stumped. In the third Test at Sydney, he scored his only double hundred in Test cricket, the first by an Indian against Australia. He was dropped in the sixties by the Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne , who was making his debut, off his own bowling. Amidst frequent interruptions by rain, he completed his hundred early on the fourth day and a six off Warne brought up the 150. He finally fell to a tired shot at Warne after nine and a half hours, scoring 206 with 17 fours and the two sixes, thus becoming Warne's first Test wicket.
It was also during this innings that the knee injury that would soon end his career appeared for the first time. India had gone into the match with four pace bowlers and no regular spinners. Shastri was little more than a part-time bowler by this time. By the final day, pitch started taking spin. Shastri took four wickets in the second innings and Australia just about beat the clock to draw the match. India could well have won the match with another spinner. [27] [28]
Last days in cricket[ edit ]
The remaining WSC matches followed the Sydney Test. In the second final against Australia Shastri worsened the knee injury. At the later stages of the innings he was forced to stand and slog. After a few quick runs, it ended in an inevitable mishit to cover. He missed the remaining two Test matches, both of which India lost. For a while it seemed doubtful that he would be able to play the World Cup which was being hosted by Australia and New Zealand, but was included at the last moment.
In their second match, India chased 238 to win in 50 overs against Australia. A rain interruption meant that the target was revised to 236 in 47 overs. Shastri took 67 balls for his 25; India went on to lose by one run. He was blamed for the defeat and dropped from the remaining matches of the tournament.
In the next season, South Africa hosted India for their first ever tour. Shastri opened in all four Tests and struggled to score runs. The only bright spot was a 16 ball 27 not out, in India's one day win at Centurion park. He had batted down the order in the one day matches of this series. In reference to the World Cup innings against Australia, he commented later that for once he knew what his exact role was.
India hosted England immediately after the South Africa series. The knee injury returned before the series and put Shastri out of cricket for eight months. He never again represented India in international cricket.
Bombay breezed through the West Zone league of the 1993–94 Ranji trophy winning all four matches – a very rare feat [29]  – by big margins. With the Test players away, Shastri captained the young team in the knockout matches. Bombay defeated Haryana by an innings and 202 runs in the pre quarter final but ran into trouble against Karnataka in the next round. Against 406, Bombay lost their first six for 174, before Shastri and Sairaj Bahutule added 259 in six hours. Shastri's individual score was 151. Bombay survived the best part of the last day to win on first innings lead. Shastri scored 612 runs in the season and took 17 wickets at 15. Bombay went on to beat Bengal in a low scoring final to lift the Ranji trophy. It was their first championship since the famous win against Delhi nine years ago.
In September 1994, while in Sri Lanka covering the Singer World Series, Shastri announced his retirement from first class cricket.
Post-retirement[ edit ]
Ravi Shastri in 2015
In late 1990, Shastri married Ritu Singh. He made his debut as a TV commentator with the World Masters Tournament in Mumbai in March 1995. [5] In 2003, he collaborated in starting up Showdiff Worldwide, a celebrity management company. He has since served ICC and BCCI in temporary official capacities and as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Some of his temporary shows, such as Super Spells, still run Star Sports and related channels. He and fellow commentator Sunil Gavaskar ended their long-term associations with ESPN-STAR Sports in April 2008 as they were contracted by the BCCI as commentators for the lucrative Indian Premier League which is being broadcast by rival network Sony Max. [1] 2008 also held great significance for Shastri as he became the father of Aleka at the age of 46. [30] He temporarily coached the Indian cricket team for their 2007 Bangladesh tour. He was named the Celebrity Torchbearer for the Oman Leg of the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay .

Major League Baseball[ edit ]

In baseball , the batting average (BA) is defined by the number of hits divided by at bats . It is usually reported to three decimal places and read without the decimal: A player with a batting average of .300 is "batting three-hundred." A point (or percentage point) is understood to be .001 . If necessary to break ties, batting averages could be taken to more than three decimal places.
Henry Chadwick , an English statistician raised on cricket , was an influential figure in the early history of baseball. In the late 19th century he adapted the concept behind the cricket batting average to devise a similar statistic for baseball. Rather than simply copy cricket's formulation of runs scored divided by outs , he realized that hits divided by at bats would provide a better measure of individual batting ability. This is because while in cricket, scoring runs is almost entirely dependent on one's own batting skill, in baseball it is largely dependent on having other good hitters on one's team. Chadwick noted that hits are independent of teammates' skills, so used this as the basis for the baseball batting average. His reason for using at bats rather than outs is less obvious, but it leads to the intuitive idea of the batting average being a percentage reflecting how often a batter gets on base, whereas in contrary, hits divided by outs is not as simple to interpret in real terms.
In modern times, a season batting average higher than .300 is considered to be excellent, and an average higher than .400 a nearly unachievable goal. The last player to do so, with enough plate appearances to qualify for the batting championship, was Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox , who hit .406 in 1941, though the best modern players either threaten to or actually do achieve it occasionally, if only for brief periods of time. There have been numerous attempts to explain the disappearance of the .400 hitter, with one of the more rigorous discussions of this question appearing in Stephen Jay Gould 's 1996 book Full House .
Ty Cobb holds the record for highest career batting average with .366, 8 points higher than Rogers Hornsby who has the second highest average in history at .358. The record for lowest career batting average for a player with more than 2,500 at-bats belongs to Bill Bergen , a catcher who played from 1901 to 1911 and recorded a .170 average in 3,028 career at-bats. The modern-era record for highest batting average for a season is held by Napoleon Lajoie , who hit .426 in 1901, the first year of play for the American League . The modern-era record for lowest batting average for a player that qualified for the batting title is held by Rob Deer , who hit .179 in 1991. While finishing six plate appearances short of qualifying for the batting title, Adam Dunn of the Chicago White Sox hit .159 for the 2011 season, twenty points (and 11.2%) lower than the record. The highest batting average for a rookie was .408 in 1911 by Shoeless Joe Jackson .
For non-pitchers, a batting average below .230 is often considered poor, and one below .200 is usually unacceptable. This latter level is sometimes referred to as "The Mendoza Line ", named for Mario Mendoza , a stellar defensive shortstop whose defensive capabilities just barely made up for his offensive shortcomings. The league batting average in Major League Baseball for 2004 was just higher than .266, and the all-time league average is between .260 and .275.
Sabermetrics , the study of baseball statistics, considers batting average a weak measure of performance because it does not correlate as well as other measures to runs scored, thereby causing it to have little predictive value. Batting average does not take into account walks or power, whereas other statistics such as on-base percentage and slugging percentage have been specifically designed to measure such concepts. Adding these statistics together form a player's On-base plus slugging or "OPS". This is commonly seen as a much better, though not perfect, indicator of a player's overall batting ability as it is a measure of hitting for average, hitting for power and drawing bases on balls .
In 1887, Major League Baseball counted bases on balls as hits . The result of this was skyrocketed batting averages, including some near .500, and the experiment was abandoned the following season.
Qualifications for the batting title[ edit ]
The Major League Baseball batting averages championships (often referred to as " the batting title ") is awarded annually to the player in each league who has the highest batting average. Ty Cobb holds the MLB (and American League ) record for most batting titles, officially winning 11 in his pro career. [1] The National League record of 8 batting titles is shared by Honus Wagner and Tony Gwynn . Most of Cobb's career and all of Wagner's career took place in what is known as the Dead-Ball Era , which was characterized by higher batting averages and much less power, whereas Gwynn's career took place in the Live-Ball Era .
To determine which players are eligible to win the batting title, the following conditions have been used over the sport's history: [9]
Pre-1920 – A player generally is required to appear in at least 100 or more games when the schedule was 154 games, and 90 games when the schedule was 140 games. An exception to the rule was made for Ty Cobb in 1914, who appeared in 98 games but had a big lead and was also a favorite of League President Ban Johnson .
1920–1949 – A player had to appear in 100 games to qualify in the National League; the AL used 100 games from 1920–1935, and 400 at-bats from 1936–1949. The NL was advised to adopt 400 at-bats for the 1945 season, but League President Ford Frick refused, feeling that 100 games should stand for the benefit of catchers and injured players. ( Taffy Wright is often erroneously said to have been cheated out of the 1938 batting title; he batted .350 in exactly 100 games, with 263 ABs. Jimmie Foxx hit .349, in 149 games and 565 AB. But since the AL requirement that year was 400 at-bats, Foxx's batting title is undisputed.)
1950–1956 – A player needed 2.6 at-bats per team game originally scheduled. (With the 154-game schedule of the time, that meant a rounded-off 400 at-bats.) From 1951–1954, if the player with the highest average in a league failed to meet the minimum at-bat requirement, the remaining at-bats until qualification (e.g., 5, if the player finished the season with 395 ABs) were hypothetically considered hitless at-bats; if his recalculated batting average still topped the league, he was awarded the title. This standard applied in the AL from 1936–1956.
1957 to the present – A player has needed 3.1 plate appearances per team game originally scheduled; thus, players were no longer penalized for walking so frequently, nor did they benefit from walking so rarely. (In 1954, for example, Ted Williams batted .345 but had only 386 ABs, while topping the AL with 136 walks. Williams thus lost the batting title to Cleveland's Bobby Ávila , who hit .341 in 555 ABs.) In the 154-game schedule, the required number of plate appearances was 477, and since the era of the 162-game schedule, the requisite number of PAs has been 502. (Adjustments to this 502 PA figure have been made during strike-shortened seasons, such as 1972, 1981, 1994, and 1995.)
From 1967 to the present, if the player with the highest average in a league fails to meet the minimum plate-appearance requirement, the remaining at-bats until qualification (e.g., 5 ABs, if the player finished the season with 497 plate appearances) are hypothetically considered hitless at-bats; if his recalculated batting average still tops the league, he is awarded the title. This is officially called Rule 10.22(a), but it is also known as the Tony Gwynn rule because the Padres' legend won the batting crown in 1996 with a .353 average on just 498 plate appearances (i.e., was four shy). Gwynn was awarded the title since he would have led the league even if he'd gone 0-for-4 in those missing plate appearances. His average would have dropped to .349, five points better than second-place Ellis Burks ' .344. [10] In 2012, a one-time amendment to the rule was made to disqualify Melky Cabrera from the title. Cabrera requested that he be disqualified after serving a suspension that season for a positive testosterone test. He had batted .346 with 501 plate appearances, and the original rule would have awarded him the title over San Francisco Giants teammate Buster Posey , who won batting .336. [11] [12]

Personal life and early career[ edit ]
Yadav's father was a coalmine worker from Village – Pokharbhinda Lala(Baraipur Lala), Post- Govindpur, Deoria district in Uttar Pradesh and Umesh grew up in Valani (WCL Colny), a village of miners near to Khaperkheda, in Nagpur District of Maharashtra State, India.His father is working in WCL Mines. He attended his Schooling in Shankar Rao Chouhan Vidyalaya, Khaperkheda. Before becoming a professional cricketer, Umesh Yadav unsuccessfully applied to join the army and the police force. In 2007–2008, having previously only ever played tennis ball cricket, Yadav began bowling with a leather ball and joined Vidarbha, an unfashionable team in the Plate League of the Ranji Trophy. Pritam Gandhe , Vidharbha's captain, supported Yadav and ensured he represented Air India in a twenty20 tournament. Of Yadav's early career Gandhe remarked "He was raw and wayward. But he was really quick – too quick. I thought that if he lands at least three out of six balls in line with the stumps, he will trouble batsmen." [2]
On 3 November 2008 Yadav made his first-class debut for Vidarbha against Madhya Pradesh in the 2008–09 Ranji Trophy . His first wicket was that of Himalaya Sagar who was out bowled; Yadav did not bowl in Madhya Pradesh' second innings, but in the first claimed four wickets for 72 runs (4/75) as his team lost by ten wickets. [3] He played in four of Vidarbha's Ranji matches that season, taking 20 wickets at an average of 14.60 with best figures of 6/105. [4] [5] Also in the 2008/09 season, Yadav made his one-day debut. [6]
From playing for Vidarbha, Yadav was selected to represent the Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy in his first season. [2] Bought by Delhi Daredevils in 2008 for $30,000, [7] Yadav made his debut in the Indian Premier League in 2010, taking 6 wickets in as many matches at an average of 30.66. [8] [9] The income from the IPL auction meant Yadav could pay for the family home to be extended. [2]
On 16 April 2013, Umesh got engaged to Delhi-based fashion designer Tanya Wadhwa, with the wedding scheduled for 29 May. [10]
Umesh Yadav was picked for the ICC Champions Trophy 2013 and played an integral role in securing India's victory. Umesh Yadav slowly became the leader of the pack until he was dropped from the squad for the India vs. Australia ODI series 2013. Umesh Yadav returned to the ODI squad for the tour of South Africa but after poor displays he was dropped after the series but picked in the test squad. Ever since the prominence of Mohammad Shami Umesh Yadav has struggled to be picked consistently.
International breakthrough[ edit ]
In May 2010, Yadav was called into India's squad for the World Twenty20 in place of the injured Praveen Kumar , [11] but did not go on to play in the tournament. Later that month, he was included in the squad to play a tri-nation ODI series in Zimbabwe against the hosts and Sri Lanka . India sent an under-strength squad with nine first-choice players either rested or injured. [12] Yadav made his ODI debut in the tournament during India's loss to Zimbabwe, a team ranked tenth by the ICC at the time. Defending a score of 285, Yadav bowled eight wicketless overs while conceding 48 runs. [13] [14] [15] Playing in three matches, Yadav took a single wicket. [16]
After the tri-series in Zimbabwe, Yadav returned to the fringes of the team. He was included as a practice bowler when India toured Sri Lanka in July to gain experience of bowling to Test batsmen. [17] He would have to wait until October 2011 before his next international match. [18] After India toured South Africa in December 2010 , Yadav was left out of the national squad. [19]
In the player auction for the 2011 Indian Premier League , the Delhi Daredevils bought Yadav for $750,000. [20] However he managed just two wickets from seven matches, while conceding 169 runs at over 9 per over. [21] [22] Yadav returned to the national set-up in September 2011 for a five-match ODI series against England . [19] An injury to his left hand meant Yadav missed the last two ODIs. At times expensive though regularly fast, [23] he managed four wickets at an average of 38.25 from three matches. [24]
When the West Indies toured in November 2011, the Indian selectors opted to change the team's fast bowlers. Sreesanth and Praveen Kumar were left out of the squad and Yadav and Varun Aaron were chosen based on their performances in the ODIs against England earlier that year. [25] Yadav made his Test debut in the first match and opened the bowling alongside Ishant Sharma in the first innings, though failed to take a wicket. In the second innings the spinners opened the bowling and Yadav took two wickets for 36 runs (2/36) to help India to a five-wicket victory. [26] Yadav was the first cricketer to play for Vidarbha who went on the play Test cricket. [2] India also won the second Test, [27] and Yadav finished with nine wickets in the series, the most amongst India's fast bowlers and less than half the total of either of the team's spinners. [28] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he managed six wickets at an average of 24.33 from three appearances. [29]
Yadav was selected as one of India's pace bowlers for their tour of Australia in 2011–12. He played in all four Tests, taking 14 wickets at an average of 39.35 as India lost the series 4–0. [30] In the third Test at the WACA Ground in Perth , he took his first five-wicket haul in Test cricket, with figures of 5/93 in Australia's first and only innings. [31] In the triangular ODI series with Australia and Sri Lanka that followed, Yadav managed 5 wickets from 6 matches at an average of 59.80. [32] At the 2012 Indian Premier League held in April and May, Yadav finished as the fourth-highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 19 dismissals from 17 matches at an average of 23.84. [33]
Bowling style[ edit ]
Umesh Yadav is the fastest Indian bowler with his top speed being 155 kmph.Writing for ESPNcricinfo in January 2012, Sidharth Monga commented that
Yadav is fit, strong, quick, and gets the ball to swing late. More importantly, he attacks the stumps, and doesn't wait for edges. Eleven of his 21 Test wickets have been bowled. Another has been lbw. Five matches is a short career for a bigger statistical analysis, but it is worth mentioning that he takes a wicket every 39.2 balls. It is not at large odds with his overall first-class strike-rate of 46.8. Attacking the stumps also leaves less control on the run flow, which shows in his economy rate of 4.24 in Tests. [34]
Former Australian bowler Glenn McGrath was impressed with Yadav's performance in the first Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in January. McGrath said
He was quite impressive. He bowls at good pace. He seems to have a great attitude and most importantly, he's a wicket-taking bowler. Perhaps, the direction and control are not there quite yet, but it's not far away.
He's got that raw talent, good pace and can generate good bounce. He's got a lot going for him at the moment. [35]

The Australian cricket team participated in the first Test match at the MCG in 1877, defeating an English team by 45 runs, with Charles Bannerman making the first Test century, a score of 165 retired hurt . Test cricket , which only occurred between Australia and England at the time, was limited by the long distance between the two countries, which would take several months by sea. Despite Australia's much smaller population, the team was very competitive in early games, producing stars such as Jack Blackham , Billy Murdoch , Fred "The Demon" Spofforth , George Bonnor , Percy McDonnell , George Giffen and Charles "The Terror" Turner . Most cricketers at the time were either from New South Wales or Victoria , with the notable exception of George Giffen , the star South Australian all-rounder .
A highlight of Australia's early history was the 1882 Test match against England at The Oval . In this match Fred Spofforth took 7/44 in the game's fourth innings to save the match by preventing England from making their 85-run target. After this match The Sporting Times , a major newspaper in London at the time, printed a mock obituary in which the death of English cricket was proclaimed and the announcement made that "the body was cremated and the ashes taken to Australia." This was the start of the famous Ashes series in which Australia and England play a Test match series to decide the holder of the Ashes. To this day, the contest is one of the fiercest rivalries in sport.

The so-called 'Golden Age' of Australian test cricket occurred around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, with the team under the captaincy of Joe Darling , Monty Noble and Clem Hill winning eight of ten tours. It participated in between the 1897–98 English tour of Australia and the 1910–11 South African tour of Australia. Outstanding batsman such as Joe Darling , Clem Hill , Reggie Duff , Syd Gregory , Warren Bardsley and Victor Trumper , brilliant all-rounders including Monty Noble , George Giffen , Harry Trott and Warwick Armstrong and excellent bowlers including Ernie Jones , Hugh Trumble , Tibby Cotter , Bill Howell , Jack Saunders and Bill Whitty , all helped Australia to become the dominant cricketing nation for most of this period.
Victor Trumper became one of Australia's first sporting heroes, and was widely considered Australia's greatest batsman before Bradman and one of the most popular players. He played a record (at the time) number of tests at 49, and scored 3163 (another record) runs at a high for the time average of 39.04. His early death in 1915 at the age of 37 from kidney disease caused national mourning. The Wisden Cricketers' Almanack , in its obituary for him, called him Australia's greatest batsman: "Of all the great Australian batsmen Victor Trumper was by general consent the best and most brilliant." [11]
The years leading up to the start of World War I were marred by conflict between the players, led by Clem Hill, Victor Trumper and Frank Laver , the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket . Led by Peter McAlister , who was attempting to gain more control of tours from the players. This led to six leading players (the so-called "Big Six") walking out on the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England, with Australia fielding what was generally considered a second-rate side. This was the last series before the war, and no more cricket was played by Australia for eight years, with Tibby Cotter being killed in Palestine during the war.
Cricket between the wars[ edit ]
Main article: History of Australian cricket from 1918–19 to 1930
Test cricket resumed in the 1920/21 season in Australia with a touring English team , captained by Johnny Douglas losing all five Tests to Australia, captained by the "Big Ship" Warwick Armstrong . Several players from before the war, including Warwick Armstrong, Charlie Macartney , Charles Kelleway , Warren Bardsley and the wicket-keeper Sammy Carter , were instrumental in the team's success, as well as new players Herbie Collins , Jack Ryder , Bert Oldfield , the spinner Arthur Mailey and the so-called "twin destroyers" Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald . The team continued its success on the 1921 Tour of England , winning three out of the five Tests in Warwick Armstrong 's last series. The side was on the whole inconsistent in the latter half of the 1920s, losing its first home Ashes series since the 1911–12 season in 1928–29.
The Bradman Era[ edit ]
Main article: History of Australian cricket from 1930–31 to 1945
The 1930 Tour of England heralded a new age of success for the Australian team. The team, led by Bill Woodfull – the "Great Un-bowlable" – featured legends of the game including Bill Ponsford , Stan McCabe , Clarrie Grimmett and the young pair of Archie Jackson and Don Bradman . Bradman was the outstanding batsman of the series, scoring a record 974 runs, including one century, two double centuries and one triple century , a massive score of 334 at Leeds which including 309 runs in a day. Jackson died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 three years later, after playing eight tests. The team was widely considered unstoppable, winning nine of its next ten Tests.
The 1932–33 England tour of Australia is considered one of the most infamous episodes of cricket, due to the England team's use of bodyline , where captain Douglas Jardine instructed his bowlers Bill Voce and Harold Larwood to bowl fast, short-pitched deliveries aimed at the bodies of the Australian batsmen. The tactic, although effective, was widely considered by Australian crowds as vicious and unsporting. Injuries to Bill Woodfull , who was struck over the heart, and Bert Oldfield , who received a fractured skull (although from a non-Bodyline ball), exacerbated the situation, almost causing a full-scale riot from the 50 000 fans at the Adelaide Oval for the Third Test. The conflict almost escalated into a diplomatic incident between the two countries, as leading Australian political figures, including the Governor of South Australia , Alexander Hore-Ruthven , protested to their English counterparts. The series ended in a 4–1 win for England, but the Bodyline tactics used were banned the year after.
The Australian team managed to overcome the damaging series, winning their next tour of England in 1934. The team was led by Bill Woodfull on his final tour, and was notably dominated by Ponsford and Bradman, who twice put on partnerships of over 380 runs, with Bradman once again scoring a triple-century at Leeds. The bowling was dominated by the spin pair of Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett , who took 53 wickets between them, with O'Reilly twice taking seven wicket hauls.
Sir Donald Bradman is widely considered the greatest batsman of all time. [12] [13] He dominated the sport from 1930 until his retirement in 1948, setting new records for the highest score in a test innings (334 vs England at Headingley in 1930), the most number of runs (6996), the most number of centuries (29), the most number of double centuries and the greatest Test and first-class batting averages. His record for the highest Test batting average – 99.94 – has never been beaten. It is almost 40 runs above the next highest average. He would have finished with an average of over 100 runs per innings if he had not been dismissed for a duck in his last Test. He was knighted in 1949 for services to cricket. He is generally considered one of Australia's greatest sporting heroes.
Test cricket was again interrupted by war , with the last Test series in 1938 made notable by Len Hutton making a world record 364 for England, with Chuck Fleetwood-Smith conceding 298 runs in England's world record total of 7–903. Ross Gregory , a notable young batsman who played two Tests before the war, was killed in the war.
Cricket after World War II[ edit ]
Main article: History of Australian cricket from 1945–46 to 1960
The team continued its success after the end of the Second World War , with the first Test (also Australia's first against New Zealand ) being played in the 1945–46 season against New Zealand. Australia was by far the most successful team of the 1940s, being undefeated throughout the decade, winning two Ashes series against England and its first Test series against India . The team capitalised on its ageing stars Bradman, Sid Barnes , Bill Brown and Lindsay Hassett while new talent, including Ian Johnson , Don Tallon , Arthur Morris , Neil Harvey , Bill Johnston and the fast bowling pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller , who all made their debut in the latter half of the 1940s, and were to form the basis of the team for a good part of the next decade. The team that Don Bradman led to England in 1948 gained the moniker The Invincibles, after going through the tour without losing a single game. Of 31 first-class games played during the tour, they won 23 and drew 8, including winning the five match Test series 4–0, with one draw. The tour was particularly notable for the Fourth Test of the series, in which Australia won by seven wickets chasing a target of 404, setting a new record for the highest runchase in Test cricket, with Arthur Morris and Bradman both scoring centuries, as well as for the final Test in the series, Bradman's last, where he finished with a duck in his last innings after needing only four runs to secure a career average of 100.
Australia was less successful in the 1950s, losing three consecutive Ashes series to England, including a horrendous 1956 Tour of England , where the 'spin twins' Laker and Lock destroyed Australia, taking 61 wickets between them, including Laker taking 19 wickets in the game (a first-class record) at Leeds , a game dubbed Laker's Match.
However, the team rebounded to win five consecutive series in the latter half of the 1950s, first under the leadership of Ian Johnson , then Ian Craig and Richie Benaud . The series against the West Indies in the 1960–61 season was notable for the Tied Test in the first game at The Gabba , which was the first in Test cricket. Australia ended up winning the series 2–1 after a hard fought series that was praised for its excellent standards and sense of fair-play. Stand-out players in that series as well as through the early part of the 1960s were Richie Benaud , who took a then-record number of wickets as a leg-spinner , and who also captained Australia in 28 Tests, including 24 without defeat; Alan Davidson , who became the first player to take 10 wickets and make 100 runs in the same game in the first Test, and was also a notable fast-bowler; Bob Simpson , who also later captained Australia for two different periods of time; Colin McDonald , the first-choice opening batsman for most of the 1950s and early '60s; Norm O'Neill , who made 181 in the Tied Test; Neil Harvey , towards the end of his long career; and Wally Grout , an excellent wicket-keeper who died at the age of 41.
1970s and onward[ edit ]
The Centenary Test was played in March 1977 at the MCG to celebrate 100 years since the first Test was played. Australia ended winning by 45 runs, an identical result to the first Test match. [14]
In May 1977 Kerry Packer announced he was organising a breakaway competition – World Series Cricket (WSC) – after the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) refused to accept Channel Nine 's bid to gain exclusive television rights to Australia's Test matches in 1976. Packer secretly signed leading international cricketers to his competition, including 28 Australians. Almost all of the Australian Test team at the time were signed to WSC – notable exceptions including Gary Cosier , Geoff Dymock , Kim Hughes and Craig Serjeant – and the Australian selectors were forced to pick what was generally considered a third-rate team from players in the Sheffield Shield . Former player Bob Simpson , who had retired 10 years previously after a conflict with the board, was recalled at the age of 41 to captain Australia against India. Jeff Thomson was named deputy in a team that included seven debutants. Australia managed to win the series 3–2, mainly thanks to the batting of Simpson, who scored 539 runs, including two centuries; and the bowling of Wayne Clark , who took 28 wickets. Australia lost the next series—against the West Indies, which was fielding a full team—3–1, and also lost the 1978–79 Ashes series 5–1, the team's worst Ashes result in Australia. Graham Yallop was named as captain for the Ashes, with Kim Hughes taking over for the 1979–80 tour of India. Rodney Hogg still managed to take 41 wickets in his debut series, an Australian record. WSC players returned to the team for the 1979–80 season after a settlement between the ACB and Kerry Packer. Greg Chappell was reinstated as captain.
The underarm bowling incident of 1981 occurred when, in a ODI against New Zealand , Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor to bowl an underarm delivery to New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie , with New Zealand needing a six to tie off the last ball. The aftermath of the incident soured political relations between Australia and New Zealand, with several leading political and cricketing figures calling it "unsportsmanlike" and " not in the spirit of cricket ".
Australia continued its success up until the early 1980s, built around Bob Simpson, the Chappell brothers, Dennis Lillee , Jeff Thomson and Rod Marsh . The 1980s was a period of relative mediocrity after the turmoil caused by the Rebel Tours of South Africa and the subsequent retirement of several key players. The rebel tours were funded by the South African Cricket Board to compete against its national side, which had been banned—along with many other sports, including Olympic athletes—from competing internationally, due to the South African government's racist apartheid policies. Some of Australia's best players were poached: Graham Yallop, Carl Rackemann , Terry Alderman , Rodney Hogg, Kim Hughes, John Dyson , Greg Shipperd , Steve Rixon and Steve Smith amongst others. These players were handed three-year suspensions by the Australian Cricket Board which greatly weakened the player pool for the national sides, as most were either current representative players or on the verge of gaining honours.
Under the captaincy of Allan Border and the new fielding standards put in place by new coach Bob Simpson, the team was restructured and gradually rebuilt their cricketing stocks. Some of the rebel players returned to the national side after serving their suspensions, including Trevor Hohns , Carl Rackemann and Terry Alderman. During these lean years, it was the batsmen Border, David Boon , Dean Jones , the young Steve Waugh and the bowling feats of Alderman, Bruce Reid , Craig McDermott , Merv Hughes and to a lesser extent, Geoff Lawson who kept the Australian side afloat.
With the emergence of players such as Ian Healy , Mark Taylor , Geoff Marsh , Mark Waugh , Greg Matthews , Damien Martyn and Matthew Hayden in the late 1980s, Australia was on the way back from the doldrums. Winning the Ashes in 1989 , the Australians got a roll on beating Pakistan , Sri Lanka and then followed it up with another Ashes win on home soil in 1991 . The Australians went on to the West Indies and had their chances but ended up losing the series. However they bounced back and beat the Indians in their next Test series. With the retirement of the champion but defensive, Allan Border, a new era of attacking cricket had begun under the leadership of firstly Mark Taylor and then Steve Waugh .
Australia won the 2015 Cricket World Cup
The 1990s and early 21st century were arguably Australia's most successful period, unbeaten in all Ashes series played bar the famous 2005 series and achieving a hat-trick of World Cups . This success has been attributed to the restructuring of the team and system by Border, successive aggressive captains, and the effectiveness of several key players, most notably Glenn McGrath , Shane Warne , Justin Langer , Matthew Hayden , Steve Waugh , Adam Gilchrist , Michael Hussey and Ricky Ponting . Following the 2006/07 Ashes series which Australia won 5 nill, Australia slipped in the rankings after the retirements of a key players. In the 2013/14 Ashes series Australia again defeated England 5 nill, and climbed back to 3rd on the ICC International Test Rankings. In February & March 2014 Australia beat the number 1 team in the world South Africa 2–1, and were re-ranked number 1 in the world. The Australian team was marred by the death of Phillip Hughes on November 27, 2014. In 2015 Australia won the 2015 Cricket World Cup . As of April 2015 Australia are ranked 2nd in Test Cricket and 1st in ODI Cricket.



Early career[ edit ]
Vijay started playing cricket at the age of 17. [1] He first played club cricket in Chennai representing Alwarpet in 2003. He was then selected in the Tamil Nadu Under-22 squad for the 2004-05 CK Nayudu Trophy. Tamil Nadu Under-22 won the tournament, but, opening the innings, Vijay averaged just 26.45 in 6 matches. [2] He continued to play club cricket in 2005, before getting selected again in the Tamil Nadu Under-22 squad for the 2005-06 CK Nayudu Trophy. He failed to impress once again, averaging 26.50 in 3 matches. [3]
Despite his below-average performances in club cricket and Under-22 tournaments, Vijay was selected in the Tamil Nadu squad for the Ranji One-day Trophy in February 2006. He made his senior cricket debut in Tamil Nadu's last group fixture of the tournament, against Karnataka on 16 February, and scored 17 in that match. [4] He scored 38 in the quarterfinal against Railways who won the match by one run. [5]
Vijay rose to prominence during the 2006-07 Ranji Trophy, his debut first-class season, in which he finished as the third highest run-getter of the tournament, only behind Karnataka's Robin Uthappa and Bengal's Manoj Tiwary . At the start of this tournament, he made his first-class debut against Delhi and scored a fifty in his debut innings. [6] He accumulated a total of 628 runs at an average of more than 52, including two hundreds and one fifty. [7] He continued his good form in the 2006-07 Ranji One-day Trophy by scoring 277 runs in 7 matches at an average of 39.57 and a high-score of 112. [8]
Vijay played in all seven matches of Tamil Nadu in the 2007-08 Ranji Trophy and scored 582 runs at an average of 58.2 with two hundreds including a high-score of 230* against Saurashtra . [9] After the conclusion of Ranji Trophy, he was selected in the South Zone squad for 2007-08 Duleep Trophy. He batted at 3 in the first match against North Zone and scored a duck and 39. [10] In the second game against East Zone , batting at 3 in the first innings, he scored 46, and registered another duck in the second innings while opening the batting. [11] In the Vijay Hazare Trophy (earlier called Ranji One-day Trophy) that followed, Vijay played seven matches in which he opened the innings thrice and batted at 3 on four occasions. He found success batting at 3, making back-to-back hundreds against Hyderabad and Andhra . [12] [13]
In September 2008, Vijay was picked in the India A team to play against the touring New Zealand A team in two 4-day matches. He carried on his good form and made 45 and 59 in the first match, batting at 3, helping India A win by 129 runs. [14] He opened the innings and scored 98 and 0 in the second match, in which New Zealand A secured victory. [15] In October 2008, Vijay was named in the India Red team for the Challenger Trophy . He played as an opener and finished second among highest run-scorers of the tournament with 164 runs from 3 matches at an average of 54.66. [16]
Test career[ edit ]
Vijay made his Test debut against Australia in the Fourth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , in Nagpur , in November 2008. He was selected for the match after Gautam Gambhir received a one-Test ban for elbowing Shane Watson in the Third Test of the same series in Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi . [17] [18] Vijay was participating in a Ranji trophy match at the time, and made his Test debut on the final day of that match. [19]
Of Vijay's technique, former Australian captain Allan Border said "His defensive shots are so assured. And he looks comfortable of both front and back foot. And when he attacks, he doesn't go hard at the deliveries. I can see why this young man is playing". [20]
Vijay partnered Virender Sehwag , and they got India off to a solid start in both innings. Vijay made 33 and 41, contributing to opening stands of 98 and 116. During Australia's first innings, Vijay caused the first wicket to fall, running out Matthew Hayden with a direct hit from mid on. Hayden was attempting a quick single. He then ran out Michael Hussey when fielding at silly point. Hussey was unaware that Vijay had intercepted the ball at close range and instinctively took a step out of his crease in anticipation of a run, by which time Vijay threw down the stumps. In the second innings, he caught Brett Lee at bat pad from the bowling of Harbhajan Singh to complete his first catch. [21]
Following his performance in his debut Test, Vijay was selected for the Indian ODI squad for the first three matches against the touring England team. He did not get to play, and was dropped after the first three matches upon the return of senior batsman Sachin Tendulkar from a break. [22]
In December 2009, Vijay was given another opportunity in the Test team when Gambhir withdrew from the Third and final Test against Sri Lanka at Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai in order to attend his sister's wedding. [23] Vijay took two catches at bat pad from Harbhajan in Sri Lanka's first innings. When India replied, he put on 221 for the first wicket with Sehwag, but was out for 87 in sight of his maiden Test century. The Indians went on to complete an innings victory, and become the number 1 Test team. [24] [25]
Vijay was taken on the tour of Bangladesh in January 2010 as the reserve batsman, and he was called into the team after V. V. S. Laxman injured a finger in the First Test. Vijay played in the Second Test in Mirpur in Laxman's No. 5 position, scoring 30. In the same maaders, Olympic officials and trustees and officials of the MCC. Convening the meeting was no small effort considering the calibre of those attending and that many of the sports officials were only part-time amateurs.
As 22 November, the date of the opening ceremony, drew closer, Melbourne was gripped ever more tightly by Olympic fever. At 3 pm the day before the opening ceremony, people began to line up outside the MCG gates. That night the city was paralysed by a quarter of a million people who had come to celebrate.
The MCG's capacity was increased by the new Olympic (or Northern) Stand, and on the day itself 103,000 people filled the stadium to capacity. A young up and coming distance runner was chosen to carry the Olympic torch into the stadium for the opening ceremony.
Although Ron Clarke had a number of junior world records for distances of 1500 m, one mile (1.6 km) and two miles (3 km), he was relatively unknown in 1956. Perhaps the opportunity to carry the torch inspired him because he went on to have a career of exceptional brilliance and was without doubt the most outstanding runner of his day. At one stage he held the world record for every distance from two miles (3 km) to 20 km. His few failures came in Olympic and Commonwealth Games competition. Although favourite for the gold at Tokyo in 1964 he was placed ninth in the 5,000 metres race and the marathon and third in the 10,000 metres. He lost again in the 1966 Commonwealth Games and in 1968 at altitude in Mexico he collapsed at the end of the 10 km race.
On that famous day in Melbourne in 1956 the torch spluttered and sparked, showering Clarke with hot magnesium, burning holes in his shirt. When he dipped the torch into the cauldron it burst into flame singeing him further. In the centre of the ground, John Landy, the fastest miler in the world, took the Olympic oath and sculler Merv Wood carried the Australian flag.
The Melbourne Games also saw the high point of Australian female sprinting with Betty Cuthbert winning three gold medals at the MCG. She won the 100 m and 200 m and anchored the winning 4 x 100 m team. Born in Merrylands in Sydney’s west she was a champion schoolgirl athlete and had already broken the world record for the 200 m just before the 1956 Games. She was to be overshadowed by her Western Suburbs club member, the Marlene Matthews . When they got to the Games, Matthews was the overwhelming favourite especially for the 100 m a distance over which Cuthbert had beaten her just once.
Both Matthews and Cuthbert won their heats with Matthews setting an Olympic record of 11.5 seconds in hers. Cuthbert broke that record in the following heat with a time of 11.4 seconds. The world record of 11.3 was held by another Australian, Shirley Strickland who was eliminated in her heat. In the final Matthews felt she got a bad start and was last at the 50 metre mark. Cuthbert sensed Isabella Daniels from the USA close behind her and pulled out a little extra to win Australia’s first gold at the Games in a time of 11.5 seconds, Matthews was third. The result was repeated in the 200 m final. Cuthbert won her second gold breaking Marjorie Jackson’s Olympic record. Mathews was third again.
By the time the 1956 Olympics came around, Shirley Strickland was a mother of 31 years of age but managed to defend her 80 m title, which she had won in Helsinki four years before, winning gold and setting a new Olympic record.
The sensational incident of the track events was the non-selection of Marlene Matthews in the 4 x 100 m relay. Matthews trained with the relay team up until the selection was made but Cuthbert, Strickland, Fleur Mellor and Norma Croker were picked for the team. There was outrage at the selection which increased when Matthews went on to run third in both the 100 m and 200 m finals. Personally she was devastated and felt that she had been overlooked for her poor baton change. Strickland was disappointed with the way Matthews was treated and maintained it was an opinion held in New South Wales that she had baton problems. One of the selectors, Doris Magee from NSW, said that selecting Matthews increased the risk of disqualification at the change. But Cuthbert maintained that the selectors made the right choice saying that Fleur Mellor was fresh, a specialist relay runner and was better around the curves than Matthews.
The men did not fare so well. The 4 x 400 m relay team, including later IOC Committee member Kevan Gosper, won silver. Charles Porter also won silver in the high jump. Hec Hogan won bronze in the 100 m to become the first Australian man to win a medal in a sprint since the turn of the century and despite injury John Landy won bronze in the 1500 m. Allan Lawrence won bronze in the 10,000 m event.
Apart from athletics, the stadium was also used for the soccer finals, the hockey finals, the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, and an exhibition game of baseball between the Australian National Team and a US armed services team at which an estimated crowd of 114,000 attended. This was the Guinness World Record for the largest attendance for any baseball game, which stood until a 29 March 2008 exhibition game between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers at the Los Angeles Coliseum (also a former Olympic venue) drawing 115,300.
The MCG was also used for another demonstration sport, Australian Rules. The Olympics being an amateur competition meant that only amateurs could play in the demonstration game. A combined team of amateurs from the VFL and VFA were selected to play a state team from the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA). The game was played 7 December 1956 with the VAFA side, wearing white jumpers, green collars and the Olympic rings on their chests, winning easily 81 to 55.
The MCG’s link with its Olympic past continues to this day. Within its walls is the IOC-endorsed Australian Gallery of Sport and Olympic Museum .
Forty-four years later at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, the Grounds served as host to several football preliminaries, making it one of a few venues ever used for more than one Olympics. [25] It is quite possible the ground may be one of the first to be used in three Olympic games, as Melbourne's Lord Mayor Robert Doyle, and Premier Ted Ballieu are considering bidding for either the 2028 or 2032 Olympic games, using the MCG as a selling point.



The Sixty Dome Mosque , a UNESCO World Heritage Site
The Mughal conquest of Bengal in Akbarnama
The excavation of Abbasid Caliphate coins in Bangladeshi archaeological sites indicate trade and political relations between the Pala Empire and the Islamic Middle East. [33] Sufism played an instrumental role in the spread of Islam in Bengal. The Muslim conquest of Bengal began in the early 13th century and was a turning point in Bengali history. [34] The achievements of previous civilizations were, however, not lost, but to a great extent, absorbed into the new Islamic polity, culture and civilization . Bakhtiar Khilji of the Delhi Sultanate defeated Lakhsman Sena of the Sena dynasty in 1204. The Mamluks , Khiljis and Tughluqs ruled the region for more than a century. Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah founded the city of Sonargaon in 1328. The Sultanate of Bengal was proclaimed in 1342. [35] The Ilyas Shahi dynasty ruled Bengal for 123 years. The sultanate was a regional power in Asia and enjoyed links with Ming China , Persia , Hejaz , Indonesia and the Ottoman Empire . [36] [37] The House of Raja Ganesha converted to Islam and reigned between 1415 and 1435. The second stint of Ilyas Shahi rule ended in a palace coup by Abyssinian generals in 1487. [35] The Hussain Shahi dynasty gained power in 1494, when Alauddin Hussain Shah , the son of the Sharif of Mecca , became the Sultan of Bengal. [38] Alauddin ushered an age of prosperity and cultural pluralism . His royal court and governors were major patrons of literature and the arts . The sultanate expanded its territory to include Arakan as a dominion . [39] Bengal's trade links on the Indian Ocean were strengthened. [40] [41] Its royal court received numerous world explorers, including Ibn Battuta , Niccolo De Conti , Ralph Fitch and Admiral Zheng He . [42] [43]
From 1517 onwards, Portuguese traders from Malacca and Goa were traversing the sea routes to Bengal. In 1528 they were permitted to open factories and customs houses in Chittagong , which grew into the settlement of Porto Grande . Sher Shah Suri conquered Bengal in 1538. He developed the Grand Trunk Road from Kabul to Chittagong. The Sur dynasty was replaced by the Afghan Karranis in 1564. The decline of the Bengal Sultanate increased the power of the aristocracy, giving rise to the Baro-Bhuyan landlords. Led by Isa Khan , the Baro-Bhuyans controlled much of eastern Bengal in the late 16th-century. They put up stiff resistance to the expansion of the Mughals, the Ahom kingdom and the Koch dynasty. The Kingdom of Mrauk U was formed in 1530 and placed Chittagong under Arakanese rule. Mrauk U was a focal point for medieval Bengali literary activities, as the royal court of Arakan became a haven for Muslim writers and bureaucrats. [44]
The Mughal Empire controlled Bengal at the end of the 16th century. Dhaka was renamed as Jahangir Nagar and became an important Mughal administrative centre. The Mughals promoted agrarian reform. [34] During the reign of Akbar , the Bengali calendar was modified in line with the Islamic hijri. The region witnessed a boom in manufacturing and agriculture, as exports grew and integration into the world economy increased. Shaista Khan defeated the Arakanese and retook Chittagong in 1666. [34] The decline of Mughal power in the 18th-century led to the formation of the Principality of Bengal . The Nawabs of Bengal presided over a period of increasing influence from European traders. Bengal was probably the wealthiest part of the subcontinent until the 18th century.
British rule
British rule began with Robert Clive 's victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757
The British East India Company gained control of Bengal after defeating its last independent Nawab at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Company rule saw the formation of the Bengal Presidency . The company instituted the Permanent Settlement in 1793. At its peak, the presidency's jurisdiction included large parts of North India, Burma and the Malacca Straits. The mutiny of 1857 resulted in the transfer of authority directly to the British crown under a viceregal government. [45] After the foundation of the British Indian Empire , Bengal was still under the heavy influence of British culture, including architecture, education and art. The region was a hotbed of revolutionary and anti-colonial movements to overthrow the British Empire . Between 1905 and 1911, an abortive partition created the short lived province of Eastern Bengal and Assam . [46]
The 1937 elections ushered the first democratically elected government in the region. A. K. Fazlul Huq of the Krishak Praja Party became the first elected Premier of British Bengal . The Lahore Resolution was adopted in 1942. It called for the creation of independent states in eastern and northwestern British India. The Muslim League formed a coalition government in 1943, with Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin as premier.
During the Second World War , the Japanese Air Force conducted air raids in Chittagong. [47] [48] Allied forces were stationed in bases across the region in support of the Burma Campaign . After the war, the British government began plans for a quick exit from the subcontinent. Negotiations between political parties, principally the Muslim League and the Congress, led to the partition plan of 1947, despite a proposal for a United Bengal , mooted by the liberal democratic Prime Minister of Bengal H. S. Suhrawardy . [49] Famine struck Bengal several times during British rule, including in 1770 and 1943 . [50]
East Pakistan

Following the exit of the British Empire in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines, with the western part going to newly created India and the eastern part (Muslim majority) joining Pakistan as a province called East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan ), with Dhaka as its capital. [51]
The Bengali Language Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in East Bengal and later East Pakistan.
In 1950, land reform was accomplished in East Bengal with the abolishment of the feudal zamindari system. [52] Despite the economic and demographic weight of the east, Pakistan's government and military were largely dominated by the upper classes from the west. The Bengali Language Movement of 1952 was the first sign of friction between the two wings of Pakistan. [53] Dissatisfaction with the central government over economic and cultural issues continued to rise through the next decade, during which the Awami League emerged as the political voice of the Bengali-speaking population. It agitated for autonomy in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Mujib), was jailed; he was released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising. In 1970, a massive cyclone devastated the coast of East Pakistan, killing up to half a million people, [54] and the central government's response was seen as poor. The anger of the Bengali population was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose Awami League had won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections, [55] was blocked from taking office.
The Surrender of Pakistan took place on 16 December 1971 at the Ramna Race Course in Dhaka, marking the liberation of Bangladesh.
After staging compromise talks with Mujibur Rahman, President Yahya Khan and military officials launched Operation Searchlight , [56] a sustained military assault on East Pakistan, and arrested Mujibur Rahman in the early hours of 26 March 1971. Yahya's methods were extremely bloody, and the violence of the war resulted in many civilian deaths. [57] Yahya's chief targets included intellectuals and Hindus, and about one million refugees fled to neighbouring India. [58] Estimates of those massacred throughout the war range from thirty thousand to three million. [59] Mujibur Rahman was ultimately released on 8 January 1972. [60]
Awami League leaders set up a government-in-exile in Calcutta , India. The exile government formally took oath at Meherpur, in the Kustia district of East Pakistan, on 17 April 1971, with Tajuddin Ahmad as the first Prime Minister and Syed Nazrul Islam as the Acting President. The Bangladesh Liberation War lasted for nine months. A resistance force known as the Mukti Bahini was formed from the Bangladesh Forces (consisting of Bengali regular forces) in alliance with civilian fighters such as the Kader Bahini and the Hemayet Bahini . Led by General M. A. G. Osmani , the Bangladesh Forces were organized into eleven sectors and, as part of Mukti Bahini, conducted a massive guerrilla war against the Pakistan Forces. The war witnessed the 1971 Bangladesh genocide , in which the Pakistan Army and its allied religious militias carried out a wide-scale elimination of Bengali civilians, intellectuals, youth, students, politicians, activists and religious minorities. By winter, Bangladesh-India Allied Forces defeated the Pakistan Army, culminating in its surrender and the Liberation of Dhaka on 16 December 1971.
Bangladesh
Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman signs the Constitution of Bangladesh into law on 16 December 1972
After independence, the Constitution of Bangladesh established a unitary secular multiparty parliamentary democratic system. The Awami League won the first general elections in 1973 with a massive mandate, gaining an absolute parliamentary majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974, [50] and in early 1975, Mujib initiated a one-party socialist rule with his newly formed BAKSAL . On 15 August 1975, Mujib and most of his family members were assassinated by mid-level military officers. [61] Vice President Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed was sworn in as President with most of Mujib's cabinet intact. Two Army uprisings on 3 and 7 November 1975 led to a reorganised structure of power. A state of emergency was declared to restore order and c(M Vijay 54, S Badrinath 44, Ex 4)

17.1 to Symonds, bowled him! Symonds went down on one knee to slog sweep and then tried to adjust and play a half-swat half-paddle, the ball pitched around off, came slowly off the pitch, beat the bat and pegged back off stump. That kept a touch low as well 81/6
17.3 to Sathish, stumped! Mumbai are sliding towards a shocking total at the fortress. Sathish charged and heaved, trying to hit the ball far too hard without getting anywhere near it. He missed and the keeper had an easy stumping to effect 82/7

Early career[ edit ]
Nannes was previously a skier . In 1995, he made his debut as a mogul skier, and went on to compete at FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup events [2] until 1999. He then turned to playing cricket for club side Hawthorn-Waverley and later Fitzroy Doncaster .
Progression to first-class cricket[ edit ]
Nannes was eventually called up to the Victorian Bushrangers side in early 2006, where he made his first-class and List A debuts. He has ability to bowl more than 150km/hr speed.[ citation needed ]
In his second first-class cricket game he played in the 2005/06 Pura Cup final in which the Queensland Bulls amassed a record 6 for 900 declared. [3] Nannes took three wickets in the innings and when it came Victoria's time to bat he was the last wicket to fall in the match.
He signed for Middlesex during the 2008 English Domestic season , qualifying as a non-overseas player due to his Dutch passport. Nannes struggled with injury in the 2008 season but was a member of Middlesex's Twenty20 triumph, and took 20 wickets at 19, including a haul of 6/32 in the county championship.
In the 2008 Sheffield Shield , Nannes took his career best figures of 7/50. In his first innings against Western Australia in Perth, he produced highly unusual innings figures of 1/2 off 0.1 overs, bowling a wicket then two beamers in succession and being banned from bowling for the remainder of the innings. [4]
In February 2010 Dirk Nannes retired from first class cricket. He said, "Having been able to play just one game in the longer format this season due to injury, this decision will allow me to concentrate on 50 over and Twenty20 cricket and extend my career with Victoria and Australia". [5] The news was generally well received by fans as Dirk had battled through many injuries in his short career.[ citation needed ]
He played for Delhi Daredevils in the IPL II and III , where he led the bowling attack. The team kept Glenn McGrath on the benches to play him. But in the auctions for IPL IV ,he was purchased by Royal Challengers Bangalore for $650,000 , where he was expected to open the bowling along with Zaheer Khan . After a couple of matches Nannes sustained a side strain and was ruled out of the IPL; he was later replaced by Chris Gayle . [6]
In 2010, Nannes played for Nottinghamshire in the revamped domestic T20 tournament in England. [7]
On 12 June 2012 it was announced Chennai Super Kings signed Dirk Nannes from Royal Challengers Banglore.
In July 2012, Nannes signed a 1-year deal with cricket club the Sydney Thunder .
Sylhet Royals of the Bangladesh Premier League signed Nannes to play for the 2013 BPL season.
On 26 April 2014, Nannes signed for English county Somerset for their entire T20 season. [8]
Netherlands[ edit ]
On Wednesday 11 November 2008 it was announced that Nannes was selected for the Netherlands cricket squad to play the ICC World Cup Qualifier tournament in South Africa. [9] However Nannes subsequently signed with the Delhi Daredevils for the 2009 IPL season , which was to be played in April at the same time as the ICC Trophy causing him to withdraw from The Netherlands' squad.
Victoria and Delhi Daredevils coach Greg Shipperd , when asked about Dirk's non selection for the Australian Twenty20 team, said that "I would have thought he would be first pick". [10] Following this omission from the Australian team, Nannes now confirmed his allegiance to the land of his parents. [11] He made his international debut for The Netherlands in the first match of the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 , opening the bowling in their surprise win over England. [12]
Australia[ edit ]
In a strange turn of events, Nannes was called up to the Australian T20I team in August 2009, just two months after making his debut for the Netherlands. [13] A one-day international debut followed that same month where Nannes picked up 1/20 against Scotland . Nannes played for Australia in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in the West Indies; Nannes played against Pakistan on 2 May 2010 at St Lucia and he took 3 wickets for 41 runs in his allocated overs, he was unbeaten batting for 0 runs facing one ball.

[302] Upon the recommendation of the British Finance Committee on the formation of a government bank, the Madras Bank, then known as the 'Government Bank', started functioning again from 1806. In 1843, the bank merged with the Carnatic Bank (1788), the British Bank of Madras (1795) and the Asiatic Bank (1804) and became the Bank of Madras , which was one of the three Presidency banks of India, the other two being the Bank of Bengal and the Bank of Bombay .

What would have been on Chennai Super Kings' wish list before this final? 1) Win toss on a slow pitch. 2) Great start by the openers. 3) Remove Chris Gayle for a duck. PS: While we are it why not knock out AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli cheaply? They got all that. Chennai produced a near-perfect game and mauled Royal Challengers Bangalore to lift their second IPL trophy.
M Vijay has rarely converted his starts this IPL and Michael Hussey hasn't sparkled in the previous few games. So what they do on the day of the big finale? They amass a sizzling 159-run partnership to launch Chennai to a massive total at the Chidambaram Stadium. R Ashwin then derailed the chase by packing off Gayle for a duck in the first over. Game over.
It was the ease with which the runs flowed and the calm manner in which they were accumulated by the Chennai openers that caught the eye. There were several big shots but nearly all of them were in conventional zones. There was just one bad shot in the first 14 overs. Just one. In the 10th over, Vijay had just played a nonchalant flick that sailed just clear of a lunging Luke Pomersbach on the deep-midwicket boundary. He then tried to slog the next ball across the line and edged it to the leg side. The reaction of the players reflected their awareness of the need to keep adrenalin in check: Vijay shadow practiced a straighter arc of the bat and Hussey rushed across to have a long chat.
For the duration of the partnership, which lasted 14.5 overs, they complemented each other with contrasting approaches. Hussey punctuated his bunts, chips and drives with the occasional big hit - the highlight was a monstrous heave off Syed Mohammad that crashed into the roof beyond wide long-on. Vijay went the other way. He punctuated his flamboyant on-the-up hits with quieter punches for singles and twos. They both ran between the wickets hard and fast and the scoring-rate never flagged. Vijay grew increasingly tired but it was Hussey who fell first, swatting a full toss from Mohammad to long-on. By then, they had laid a great platform.
It was Vijay who started the mayhem off the final delivery of the second over with a special shot. It was a short-of-length delivery with little room for maneuvering, or so it seemed, but Vijay wafted it on the up and through the line for a flamboyant six over long-on. Hussey pulled the next delivery, from Zaheer Khan, over the backward square-leg boundary to launch the assault. They repeated that double-dose of sixes again. Hussey swung the final delivery of the fifth over, bowled by Mohammad, over the midwicket boundary and Vijay lifted the next ball, from Chris Gayle, over long-on. Chennai reached 56 for 0 in six overs and kept going from strength to strength.
They started their bowling in the same way. Ashwin just needed three deliveries to remove the chief thorn in their path. The first two turned sharply away from Gayle before the third swerved in from round the stumps and skidded on to collect the edge from an attempted cut. de Villiers reeled off a few big shots but was trapped by Shadab Jakati and Suresh Raina had Kohli lbw to sew up the game for Chennai.
In contrast Bangalore slipped on the little things that matter on this stage. In the Powerplay, there were three instances of fielders succumbing to adrenalin rushes and indulging in needless throws; one, from Saurabh Tiwary, even went to the boundary. Pomersbach could have done a better job in seizing that chance from Vijay in the 10th over, and S Aravind messed up an opportunity to run out Hussey in the 12th over. Vijay, the non-striker, had called Hussey for a risky single and Aravind, the bowler who picked up the ball at short mid-on, flung it wide at the non-striker's end. There was another instance in the 11th over when the bowler, Mohammad, flung himself full stretch to his right but couldn't hang on to a difficult chance offered by Vijay. It was that kind of day. Things just didn't go right for Bangalore and everything went according to script for Chennai.

Initiatives[ edit ]
NDTV organises campaigns through its channels to support education, rural electrification , and awareness on climate change. Some of its campaigns are as follows:
Greenathon: An event to generate money to spread awareness on climate change and rural electrification. It was supported by many actors such as Priyanka Chopra , Shah Rukh Khan , Karan Johar . There have been two successful seasons of Greenathon campaign in 2010 and 2011 resulting in donations of more than 130 million Rupees. It is also sponsored by automaker Toyota .
Save Our Tiger Campaign: This campaign was launched on 30 January 2010 by Indian telecom company Aircel in partnership with NDTV and WWF-India . The goal was to create awareness among Indians about the rapidly decreasing tiger population in India . The first year of the NDTV campaign culminated in a 12-hour telethon. During the telethon, people appealed to political leaders and the masses to do whatever they could to help safeguard the Indian tiger. As a result of the campaign, several prominent political leaders came on air and pledged to protect the forests of their respective states. [7] [8] During the telethon 19.9 million rupees were raised through donations. The funds collected were donated to "Rapid Response Units (RRU)" to equip and train forest departments to respond during emergency situations like man-animal conflict, anti-poaching patrolling, fire-fighting among others. [9]
Support My School Campaign: On 24 January 2011 NDTV in partnership with Coca-Cola India, CAF and UN-Habitat launched the "Support My School" campaign. [10] The motive of this telethon was to create awareness on water and sanitation, environment and healthy active living. Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar was the brand ambassador of this campaign. [11] On 18 September 2011 an event was organised to support education in rural India. It was supported by Sachin Tendulkar and Bollywood Actor Sanjay Dutt . The event generated more than 72 million Rupees to fund the needs of more than 140 schools. [12]
Fit India Movement: On 16 March 2011 NDTV and Nirmal Lifestyle launched a long-term campaign: Fit India Movement. The purpose of this movement is to change the way Indians think about their fitness and make India a healthy nation. The "Mission-1" of this movement was "Marks for Sports". [13]
Marks for Sports: This initiative was launched on 16 March 2011 under the "Fit India Movement" of NDTV and Nirmal Lifestyle. The goal of is to push for inclusion of sports in the school curriculum, hoping that this will make parents encourage their children to take up sports. Actor Ranbir Kapoor , Dr. Prannoy Roy , chairman, NDTV and Dharmesh Jain, chairman and managing director of Nirmal Lifestyle launched this initiative in New Delhi. [13]
Save India's Coasts: This campaign was an initiative of NDTV and Toyota Etios . NDTV's crew travelled the entire coast of India, starting in western Gujarat and ending in West Bengal in six weeks, reporting on the issues facing the coast along the way. [14]
Green Champion: This campaign was an initiative of NDTV with Godrej. It is India's first environment based reality show, consisting of 13 episodes and 15 contestants who travel across the country to perform green tasks such as installation of solar panel in a rural home, developing a rainwater harvesting system at a rural school, installing a drip irrigation system in a farm. The show is telecasted on 4 channels of NDTV. [15]
Cases and Controversies[ edit ]
Allegation of corruption and criminal conspiracy[ edit ]
On 20 January 1998 Central Bureau of Investigation filed cases against New Delhi Television (NDTV) managing director Prannoy Roy, former director general of Doordarshan R. Basu and five other top officials of Doordarshan under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for criminal conspiracy and under the Prevention of Corruption Act. According to the CBI charge-sheet, Doordarshan suffered a loss of over Rs 35.2 million due to the "undue favours" shown to NDTV as its programme The World This Week (TWTW) was put in 'A' category instead of 'special A' category. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]
Radia tapes controversy[ edit ]
Main article: Radia tapes controversy
In November 2010, OPEN magazine carried a story which reported transcripts of some of the telephone conversations of Nira Radia with senior journalists, politicians, and corporate houses, many of whom have denied the allegations. The Central Bureau of Investigation has announced that they have 5,851 recordings of phone conversations by Radia, some of which outline Radia's attempts to broker deals in relation to the 2G spectrum sale. [22] The tapes appear to demonstrate how Radia attempted to use some media persons including NDTV's Barkha Dutt to influence the decision to appoint A. Raja as telecom minister. [23] She always denied her role in this episode with stating her role as simply error of judgment. Barkha Dutt is being investigated by the CBI.
Allegation of tax fraud[ edit ]
NDTV, through its foreign subsidiaries, is alleged to have violated Indian tax and corporate laws. [24] NDTV has denied these allegations.
The Sunday Guardian ran a story which exposed the NDTV's financial misdemeanours and malpractices in connivance with ICICI Bank. "NDTV-ICICI loan chicanery saved Roys" provides details of how NDTV's major stake holders raised funds by misdeclaration of the value of shares in NDTV. NDTV has denied the allegations and the NDTV CEO replied to the Sunday Guardian along with the threat of "criminal defamation".
On 19 November 2015 the ED served 2,030 crore notice to NDTV for alleged violations under the FEMA act, [25] however the company said it has been advised that the allegations are not "legally tenable". [26]
Commonwealth Games Contract[ edit ]
On 5 August 2011 Comptroller and Auditor General of India 's report on XIX Commonwealth Games was tabled in Parliament of India . In section 14.4.2 of the report, CAG alleged that while awarding contracts worth Rs 37.8 million for production & broadcasting of commercials for promoting CWG-2010 to NDTV & CNN-IBN, the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee followed an arbitrary approach. Proposals were considered in an ad hoc manner, as and when a proposal was received; no form of competitive tendering was adopted. The CAG further said in its report that, "We had no assurance about the competitiveness of the rates quoted by these channels and the need and usefulness of these proposals. From March 2010 to June 2010, the entire pre games publicity and sponsorship publicity was done only on NDTV & CNN-IBN." [27] [28] [29]
Suit against TAM India[ edit ]
News broadcaster company sued television audience measurement company, TAM India and its global parent firms for over a billion dollars in the Supreme Court of New York, alleging TAM of manipulating ratings in return for bribes to its officials. [30]



History[ edit ]
HCA's previous home ground was the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground belonged to the Sports Authority of Telangana State and HCA had limited operating autonomy over this ground.
Moreover, due to its smaller size, it soon came to be known as a high-scoring ground and so Hyderabad was not considered for many high profile cricket matches in India.
In 2003, the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh , then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu . The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal .
Most of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction with a bid price of Rs. 65,00,00,000. A sum of Rs. 43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named as Visakha International Cricket Stadium in 2004.
By 2005 when most of the stadium was built, it was ready to host its first ODI Match between India and South Africa . However, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy the former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh decided to change the name of the stadium to Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in memory of the former Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi .
Following this decision, HCA was required to pay Visakha Industries six times the contract price in accordance with the contract clauses governing any subsequent renaming of the stadium or the Visakha name not remaining attached to the stadium. HCA however, following some negotiations by Govt, got away by paying an amount of Rs. 43,00,00,000, i.e. the contract price only.
Ground capacity & factors[ edit ]
Now Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium is regarded one of the Professional and good Cricket stadiums that extends across 16 acres and has a seating capacity of 55,000 spectatprs,The ends are Pavilion End and North End(v.v.s laxman end).
Flood lights are also mounted on Six towers to illuminate the stadium during day-night matches, Flood lights were commissioned in April 2007.
The wicket here is considered as a flat track,This means that the spinners would enjoy bowling here than the pacers,India almost chased down 350 in an ODI against Australia - Sachin Tendulkar scored 175,which has a reputation of being batsman friendly and high scoring pitch

SunRisers Hyderabad[ edit ]
SRH Fans while an ipl match
Sunrisers Hyderabad (Telugu: సన్ రైజర్స్ హైదరాబాద్) is a cricket franchise based in Hyderabad by the IPL Governing Council.[1] The team is owned by Kalanithi Maran of the Sun TV Network .[2]
David Warner is the captain of the team. Tom Moody is the head coach and Simon Helmot is the assistant coach of the team. Kris Srikkanth and VVS Laxman are the mentors of the team while Waqar Younis was the bowling coach of the team.[3]
The team jersey was unveiled on 8 March 2013, and team anthem directed by GV Prakash Kumar was released on 12 March 2013. Their logo was unveiled on 20 December 2012, along with the announcement that the team's management would be led by Kris , Tom Moody and VVS Laxman .
The stadium suffered from a jinx of losing matches for the home team so the management had decided to change the dressing room position of the home team and also installed a sculpture of Lord Ganesha who is the god for success and the efforts of the management finally resulted in a win for India in the next match beating England with a margin of over a hundred runs. India won 2 out of 3 test matches hosted at this venue (1 Drawn). It also turned the fortunes of Sunrisers Hyderabad with almost all wins at home.
It is the 101st venue for test matches in world cricket. [2]
Team (A)



$2.5 million – Winners
Controversies arose after the conclusion of the tournament, when teams reported to have not received their tournament prize money, which was due to be paid by the end of January 2011. As of 9 March 2011, the full $6 million has yet to be paid to the teams. The participation fees have also yet to be paid. [7] [8] [9]
Teams[ edit ]
This tournament had two teams less compared to the previous edition due to the absence of English county teams because the tournament dates clashed with the end of England's domestic season. [10] The England national team also had a One Day International series with Pakistan during the tournament period. The format of the tournament was modified to accommodate this.
Apart from England, Pakistan is the only other top-eight Test-playing nation not to be represented in the tournament. In February 2010, Ijaz Butt , the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board , had reportedly refused participation in the tournament due to the snubbing of Pakistani cricketers in the 2010 Indian Premier League player auction. The auction resulted in none of them being bought for the league. [11] Butt later stated his comments were misunderstood, but the Champions League administrators had already decided to leave out Pakistan due to Butt's statements. Champions League officials have made contradicting statements as to whether a Pakistan team would have been considered regardless of Butt's statement. Pakistan was also absent from the previous edition due to the deterioration of relations between host nation India and Pakistan. [12]

Main article: 2012 Indian Premier League
Though Pune boycotted the IPL auction, they signed international cricketers outside the auction including Marlon Samuels , Luke Wright , Steve Smith , Tamim Iqbal , James Hopes and Michael Clarke . They also signed Indian players including Raiphi Gomez , Ali Murtaza , Ashok Dinda , Anustup Majumdar and Mahesh Rawat . Due to Yuvraj's unavailability for the entire season, Ganguly was made the captain of the franchise. [22] He was also made part of the coaching staff as a mentor. [23] Former South African fast bowler Allan Donald and former Indian batsman Praveen Amre were also roped in as bowling and batting coaches respectively, replacing Marsh who had resigned to become the Sri Lankan coach. [23]
The team started off their IPL 2012 campaign with wins against Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab away and at home respectively. But just like in 2011, the team could not maintain the initial momentum and again managed to win only 2 more matches that season, against defending champions Chennai Super Kings at home and Delhi Daredevils away. Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor. [22] However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still the team lost by 35 runs. Pune finished last that season with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches.
Main article: 2013 Indian Premier League
For the 2013 season, Pune Warriors India retained Steve Smith, Tamim Iqbal, Marlon Samuels and Luke Wright but released Clarke, James Hopes, Callum Ferguson, Alfonso Thomas, Murali Kartik and Jesse Ryder. Ganguly announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in October 2012, [24] leaving the franchise without a captain. In the auction which was held on 3 February 2013, Clarke was bought back by the franchise for $400,000. [25] The team also bought international players like Ajantha Mendis and Kane Richardson and signed domestic players like Abhishek Nayar , Tirumalasetti Suman , Ishwar Pandey , Parvez Rasool and Udit Birla for the 2013 season. The franchise also swapped a player with the Delhi Daredevils, trading Nehra for New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor . [26] Yuvraj also returned to the team following his recovery from cancer. Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the Australian tour of India held earlier. [27] On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season [28] and also signed Australian batsman Aaron Finch as a replacement for Clarke. [29]
The team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team managed to win were against Rajasthan Royals (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy Chris Gayle 's 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.
Second and final withdrawal from IPL[ edit ]
On 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years. [6] The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee. [6] BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so. [30] But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL. In a statement from Sahara after pulling out Pune Warriors India from the IPL, it stated that Sahara had to pull out of IPL due to the BCCI's stubborn and disinterested attitude towards the reduction of the Pune team's franchise fee. [17] It also stated that Sahara was "disgusted" by the unsporting and biased attitude of the BCCI towards it and the Pune franchise despite its supporting of Indian cricket for more than a decade, [17] the decision to withdraw from the IPL was final and it will not return to the IPL even if the entire franchise fee is waived by the BCCI. [17] However, it added that Sahara would remain the sponsor of the Indian cricket team until December 2013, when its contract with the BCCI expires, following which it asked the BCCI to find a new sponsor for the team. [17] Speaking to the media on 24 May 2013, Subrata Roy said that the attitude of BCCI president and India Cements chairman N. Srinivasan towards Sahara and the Pune franchise was the main reason for the withdrawal of Sahara from IPL and Indian cricket and also added that Sahara would never be associated with Indian cricket as long as Srinivasan is at the helm of BCCI affairs. [31]
On 26 October 2013, the BCCI officially terminated its agreement with the team, bringing an end to the team's IPL sojourn. [7]
Home ground[ edit ]
DY Patil Stadium , the initial "home" ground of Pune Warriors India
Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium at Gahunje, the home ground of Pune Warriors India from 2012–2013
In their inaugural season in 2011, the team played their home matches at the DY Patil Stadium at Navi Mumbai , as their designated home venue, the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium , was still under construction. Only from the 2012 season onwards did the team actually begin to play their home matches in Pune at the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium, named after the Chairman of Sahara India Pariwar. It is located at Gahunje, a village located about 23 kilometres (14 mi) north-west of Pune on the Mumbai Pune Expressway . [5] It has a seating capacity of 55,000 spectators. [3]
The stadium became a source of contention between Sahara India Pariwar and the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA). In early 2013, Sahara moved court over the termination of the agreement between it and the MCA over the stadium by the latter. MCA had terminated the agreement on the ground due to Sahara defaulting over payments to the MCA and had renamed the stadium as the MCA Pune International Cricket Centre. [32] Sahara decided to play all their home matches outside Pune till the issue was resolved. [33] On 15 March 2013, the issue was finally resolved, with Sahara agreeing to pay all existing dues within three months. [34] The stadium was renamed back to Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium and MCA also allowed Pune Warriors India to play all its home matches in the stadium. [33] [34]
Team identity[ edit ]
Team name and logo[ edit ]
The Pune franchise named the team Pune Warriors India in honour of the Maratha Empire which once ruled from the city. The Pune Warriors India logo was a spear wielding, attacking cavalry-warrior (warrior on horse) in the hue of the Indian tricolour . [35] The team logo is still same in. Exide
Jersey colours[ edit ]
In their inaugural season, the team's jersey was black with silver stripes on the sides. The jersey also incorporated the attacking warrior logo in the top-left corner of the shirt. From the 2012 season onwards, the colour of the jersey was changed to turquoise blue with silver stripes on the sides and the Indian tricolour on the back collar and sleeve edges of the shirt. The attacking warrior logo was again on the top-left corner of the shirt. Adidas was the kit manufacturer for the 2011 season, but for the final two seasons, T. K. Sportswear was the kit manufacturer. Indian online fashion clothing brand American Swan was the official lifestyle clothing partner for the team. [36] Reebok and Arrow is the clothing sponsor
Sponsors[ edit ]
For their first two seasons, the main sponsor for the team was TVS Motors . [37] TVS was replaced as the team's main sponsor for their final season by Sansui Electric , a Japanese consumer appliance manufacturer. [38] The other sponsors were Lux Cozi , Nissan , UB Group , Linc Pens, Oakley Inc. , You Broadband , Killer Jeans and Finolex Group .For the 3 seasons oF Exide BMW is the main sponsor.BMW will be replaced by Brittania as the main sponsor. The other sponsors are Indigo Airlines , Seagrams , Jockey , Reynolds [ disambiguation needed ], Raymonds , Fastrack , Airtel and Ashirwad Pipes
Theme song[ edit ]
The team's official theme song was "Sahara Saharaa", a Hindi song sung by leading playback singer and music composer Shankar Mahadevan . The video of the song showed a warrior riding on a horse and inspiring the Pune residents to come to the stadium where they witnessed the team cricketers. Then the team cricketers as well as the residents performed the Sahara salute (putting the right hand over the heart and saying "Jai Sahara").
Indian cheerleaders[ edit ]
Pune Warriors India was the only IPL franchise which used Indian cheerleaders unlike the other franchises which use foreign cheerleaders. Known as Cheer Queens, these cheerleaders were dressed up in traditional Indian attire designed by famous Bollywood designer Neeta Lulla and performed traditional Indian dances choreographed by ace choreographers Ganesh Hegde and Tanusree Shankar , not the traditional gymnastic routines which are usually associated with cheerleading. [39] In the words of Subrata Roy-
With Pune Warriors India's Cheer Queens, we intend to showcase and bring recognition to the rich and diverse culture of India at an international platform. The opportunity, which we want all the franchisees of IPL to avail collectively, so that the rich cultural heritage of India is presented in an innovative way to the world. [39]
Squads (in alphabetical order)[ edit ]

7.1 to Dravid, there's something about this IPL, it just doesn't let Dravid carry on with his starts, and he seems to keep getting out to soft dismissals. Here's another. His namesake drops this short and slow, it sits up like a cookie that has to be consumed in a hurry, Dravid goes for the pull and ends up slapping it right back at the bowler. Nicely held. 43/2
10.1 to Botha, another reverse sweep expert perishes to the reverse sweep today. Rahul Sharma fires this in very full on middle, Botha tries to take it on the full and reverse slap it through third man, but the ball thuds into his boot before the bat can come down. Plumb and given by Taufel. I reckon even Tarapore would have given this out. 59/3
14.1 to Menaria, is it too late in the game? Rahul Sharma has got Menaria to mis-hit one of his big swings into the leg side. Superb catch from Alfonso Thomas, who, for me, has been the best Pune player in this IPL. This was in the slot, Menaria lined him up and looked to go downtown, but lofted it towards wide long-on. Alfonso runs across from long-on and takes it. 92/4

5.4 to Badrinath, gone! Badri holes out to long off, he had decided to go over the top, was nowhere near the pitch of the ball as he came down the track, and just managed to loft it high in the air, Mithun came in from long off, got under the ball and took a well judged catch 22/4
15.1 to Bravo, Dan it is, the arm ball gets Bravo, tossed up around off and gets him to push forward outside the line for the turn, there isn't any turn, Bravo seemed to have got an inside edge on to pad, or did he, uimpire Hariharan through there was none, AB the ever-alert man had already got to the ball in front of Dwayne and taken the bails off, the ball would have just taken top off off 79/6

[3] He made India's Under-19 squad to the 2002 World Cup in New Zealand [4] with the likes of Irfan Pathan and Parthiv Patel where an injury to his eye in the game against Bangladesh halted his development. He couldn't make the breakthrough into senior cricket for years, and got just one opportunity for Mumbai, a one-dayer in 2006. There was no high-profile cricket for him for another few years, till Rajasthan Royals punted on him in the 2009 season, where he played a couple of matches. That earned him a place in Mumbai's Twenty20 side, and he turned in a few powerful performances for them, which led to a contract with Kings XI Punjab in 2011.
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
Paul Valthaty was picked by Kings XI Punjab as a backup to expensive international buys at a player auction in January. [5] He was the opening batsmen for Kings XI Punjab , had an outstanding game in the 2011 Indian Premier League against the reigning champions Chennai Super Kings . Valthaty raced to 120 not out in 63 balls as the Kings XI Punjab chased down the mammoth 189-run target with six wickets and five balls to spare at Mohali. It was the first hundred of IPL 2011 and 13th overall and this century is his first fastest century. [6] It remains the 5th highest IPL score ever, after, Chris Gayle 's 175* & 128, Brendonrying between nine and twelve, are officially observed in individual states.
Throughout India, many people practice customs and religious rituals, such as " Saṃskāra ", which is a series of "personal sacraments and rites conducted at various stages throughout life". [327]
Clothing
Main article: Clothing in India
Cotton was domesticated in India by 4000 BCE. Traditional Indian dress varies in colour and style across regions and depends on various factors, including climate and faith. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as the sari for women and the dhoti or lungi for men. Stitched clothes, such as the shalwar kameez for women and kurta – pyjama combinations or European-style trousers and shirts for men, are also popular. [328] Use of delicate jewellery, modelled on real flowers worn in ancient India, is part of a tradition dating back some 5,000 years; gemstones are also worn in India as talismans. [329]

A game of kabaddi in Bagepalli , Karnataka
In India, several traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular, such as kabaddi , kho kho , pehlwani and gilli-danda . Some of the earliest forms of Asian martial arts , such as kalarippayattu , musti yuddha , silambam , and marma adi , originated in India. Chess , commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga , is regaining widespread popularity with the rise in the number of Indian grandmasters . [330] [331] Pachisi , from which parcheesi derives, was played on a giant marble court by Akbar . [332]
The improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country. [333] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics , the World Shooting Championships , and the Commonwealth Games. [334] [335] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton [336] ( Saina Nehwal is the top ranked female badminton player in the world), boxing, [337] and wrestling. [338] Football is popular in West Bengal , Goa , Tamil Nadu , Kerala , and the north-eastern states . [339]
Field hockey in India is administered by Hockey India . The Indian national hockey team won the 1975 Hockey World Cup and have, as of 2012, taken eight gold, one silver, and two bronze Olympic medals, making it the sport's most successful team in the Olympics.
India has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games ; the 1987 , 1996 , and 2011 Cricket World Cup tournaments; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games ; the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy ; the 2010 Hockey World Cup ; and the 2010 Commonwealth Games . Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Chennai Open , the Mumbai Marathon , the Delhi Half Marathon , and the Indian Masters . The first Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014. [340]
India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games . An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where Team India won three out of four tournaments to date. [341] The Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and the Arjuna Award are the highest forms of government recognition for athletic achievement; the Dronacharya Award is awarded for excellence in coaching.

Main article: Etymology of London
The name London may derive from the River Thames
The etymology of London is uncertain. [50] It is an ancient name, found in sources from the 2nd century. It is recorded c. 121 as Londinium , which points to Romano-British origin. [50] The earliest attempted explanation, now disregarded, is attributed to Geoffrey of Monmouth in Historia Regum Britanniae . [50] This had it that the name originated from a supposed King Lud , who had allegedly taken over the city and named it Kaerlud. [51]
From 1898, it was commonly accepted that the name was of Celtic origin and meant place belonging to a man called *Londinos; this explanation has since been rejected. [50] Richard Coates put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic Old European *(p)lowonida, meaning 'river too wide to ford', and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, *Lowonidonjon; [52] this requires quite a serious amendment however. The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form Londinium with the modern Welsh Llundain, which should demand a form *(h)lōndinion (as opposed to *londīnion), from earlier *loundiniom. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the Welsh name was borrowed back in from English at a later date, and thus cannot be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name.
Until 1889, the name "London" officially applied only to the City of London , but since then it has also referred to the County of London and now Greater London . [6]
Prehistory[ edit ]
Two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in the London area. In 1999, the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge . [53] This bridge either crossed the Thames, or went to a now lost island in the river. Dendrology dated the timbers to 1500 BC. [53] In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4500 BC, were found on the Thames foreshore, south of Vauxhall Bridge. [54] The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on South Bank, at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames. [54]
Roman London[ edit ]
In 1300, the City was still confined within the Roman walls .
Although there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans after the invasion of 43 AD. [55] This lasted only until around 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground. [56] The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.
Anglo-Saxon London (and Viking period)[ edit ]
With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London ceased to be a capital and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued in the St Martin-in-the-Fields area until around 450. [57] From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed in the same area, slightly to the west of the old Roman city. [58] By about 680, it had revived sufficiently to become a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production of goods. From the 820s the town declined because of repeated Viking invasions. There are three recorded Viking assaults on London; two of which were successful in 851 and 886 AD, although they were defeated during the attack of 994 AD. [59]
The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist sally.
The Vikings established Danelaw over much of the eastern and northern part of England with its boundary roughly stretching from London to Chester . It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally agreed to by the Danish warlord , Guthrum and west- Saxon king , Alfred the Great in 886 AD. Danelaw lasted in many parts of England for centuries to come. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that London was "refounded" by Alfred the Great in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically. [60]
By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey , rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor , was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on, London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton : "It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital." [61] [62]
Middle Ages[ edit ]
Westminster Abbey , as seen in this painting (Canaletto, 1749), is a World Heritage Site and one of London's oldest and most important buildings
Following his victory in the Battle of Hastings , William, Duke of Normandy , was crowned King of England in the newly finished Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066. [63] William constructed the Tower of London , the first of the many Norman castles in England to be rebuilt in stone, in the southeastern corner of the city, to intimidate the native inhabitants. [64] In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall , close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster . [65] [66]
During the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. In most cases this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London . In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000. [67]
Disaster struck during the Black Death in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population. [68] London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. [69]
Early modern[ edit ]
The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666.
Map of London in 1593. There is only one bridge across the Thames, but parts of Southwark on the south bank of the river have been developed.
During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, much of London passing from church to private ownership. [70] The traffic in woollen cloths shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries , where it was considered indispensable. [71] But the tentacles of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps ; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan . Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity. [72] The Royal Exchange was founded. [73] Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World . London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605. [70]
In the 16th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre . By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, through the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605. [74] London was plagued by disease in the early 17th century, [75] culminating in the Great Plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population. [76]
The Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings. [77] Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke [78] [79] [80] as Surveyor of London. [81] In 1708 Christopher Wren 's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral was completed. During the Georgian era , new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London . In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream.
In 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was dogged by crime, and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force. [82] In total, more than 200 offences were punishable by death, [83] including petty theft. [84] Most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday. [85] The coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas, with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available; and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press.
According to Samuel Johnson:
You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.
Late modern and contemporary[ edit ]

A bombed-out London street during the Blitz of the Second World War
London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925 . [87] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, [88] claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866. [89] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital. London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War while during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe , killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city. Immediately after the war, the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium , at a time when London had barely recovered from the war.
In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank . The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956 , which ended the " pea soup fogs " for which London had been notorious. From the 1940s onwards, London became home to a large number of immigrants , largely from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica , India, Bangladesh and Pakistan , making London one of the most diverse cities in Europe.
A view from Victoria Tower, in late 1920s
Primarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture , exemplified by the Swinging London subculture associated with the King's Road , Chelsea and Carnaby Street . The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA . Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot .
Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury , with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s. The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea .
The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration. In 2000, London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the Greater London Authority . To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the Millennium Dome , London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed. On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics , making London the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times. [90] In January 2015, Greater London's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, the highest level since 1939. [91]

India won the toss and elected to bat.
Stuart Binny (Ind) made his Test debut.
The 1st Test was a dull affair after the pitch proved to be difficult to bowl on. India won the toss and with the help of Murali Vijay 's first century outside India and a 10th-wicket stand of 111 runs from Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami , India scored 457. Alastair Cook 's poor form with the bat continued and England were at 298/9 late on day 3, but a Test-record 198-run partnership between James Anderson and Joe Root for the final wicket helped them to a lead of 39 runs by the end of the innings. On the morning of the fifth day, some incisive bowling from England led to a possibility of a result, but a half-century from Stuart Binny on his Test debut meant the match resulted in a draw, but not before Cook brought himself on to bowl, taking his maiden Test wicket in his second over.[ citation needed ]
At the end of the match, it was reported that India had complained against Anderson of physical abuse against Ravindra Jadeja at lunch on day 2, which led to level 3 charges being brought against Anderson and level 2 against Jadeja. The hearing was to be held on 22 July after the end of the 2nd Test. [11] The charge against Jadeja was later reduced to level 1 and he was fined 50 percent of his match fee. The BCCI appealed against the fine and after a six-hour hearing over video conference, both players were found not guilty. [12]

Domestic and first-class career
Ishant plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and has taken 68 wickets in 14  first-class games, [9] [10] including a five-wicket haul against Baroda on the opening day of a match Delhi drew after failing to bowl Baroda out on the fourth day. [11]
Ishant toured England with the India Under-19s in 2006 and Pakistan in 2006–07. He played three youth tests and six youth One Day Internationals for India. On the basis of his strong performance in Australia in 2008, Ishant Sharma was bought for a winning bid of $950,000 by Kolkata Knight Riders in the player auction for the Indian Premier League . This was the highest amount paid for any bowler in tournament.
International career
Ishant Sharma in 2008
In May 2007, Sharma was selected in the test team for the Bangladesh tour and played as a replacement for the fast bowler Munaf Patel . Over there he played for his national side in the second test where he bowled three overs including one maiden and conceded only five runs without taking a wicket. [12] Later on, he was called for the tour of England in July–August 2007.
Sharma got a call back in the team in the 3rd Test during Pakistan's tour of India in December 2007 due to injury of India's frontline pacers Zaheer Khan , RP Singh , and Sreesanth . [13] Sharma picked up 5 wickets during the third test in Bangalore . [14] This performance earned him a place in India's squad for the tour of Australia.
Sharma was left out in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne during the Border–Gavaskar Trophy as India retained their main fast bowlers, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh. However, in January 2008 Sharma was called to represent India once again to replace the injured Zaheer Khan in the second test at the SCG . Sharma started the first day of the match strongly and was involved in a controversial decision from Steve Bucknor when Andrew Symonds nicked the ball to keeper MS Dhoni off his bowling but was given not out. He bowled reasonably in the match, however without much luck.
Although he had little success, the management retained him for the third Test match at Perth. On the fourth day of the match he bowled an exceptional spell to Australian captain Ricky Ponting that resulted in his wicket and helped India claim victory. [15] He used the pace and bounce of the WACA wicket to trouble the batsmen. In the following test played in Adelaide he picked up two wickets and impressed everyone with his bowling. He finished the tour of Australia with figures of 6/358, an average of 59.66 and a strike rate of 101.0. [16]
On 10 February 2008, Sharma bagged four important wickets in the 4th ODI of CB Series against Australia. He ended the match with figures of 4/38 and named Man of the Match. [17] He scalped two important wickets on 18 February 2008 versus Australia in the 7th ODI of CB series. [18]
During the 2008 Test series against Australia in India , Ishant was the leading wicket-taker, with 16, and was named man-of-the-series as India won 2–0. He thereby became the first Indian paceman to win such an award in a Test series on Indian soil after Kapil Dev who won the award in 1983. He was noted for achieving reverse swing on balls sometimes as young as eight overs, and along with senior opening bowler Zaheer Khan, troubled the touring Australians. [19] He took Australian captain Ricky Ponting's wicket three times during the series, and six times in as many Tests, making the Indian press label Ponting as Ishant's bunny. [20]
However, in 2009, Ishant's form slumped, and he was dropped for the second Test against Sri Lanka, replaced by Sreesanth .
On 5 October 2010, Ishant helped VVS Laxman pull off a highly unlikely win over Australia by one wicket in the first Test in Mohali after India had fallen to 8/124 in pursuit of 205. Ishant provided Laxman with support during an 81-run partnership in which he contributed 31 valuable runs.
Sharma bowling in the nets in 2008
In the 2011 IPL auction, Sharma was bought by the Deccan Chargers ; he hoped that his performance in the competition would give him a chance to impress selectors and push for selection in India's ODI team. [21] From 12 matches, Sharma took 11 wickets at an average of 28.54. [22] A month after the IPL, which was held in April and May, India toured the West Indies for five ODIs and three Tests . Several senior players were rested from the ODI side and others absent through injury; this mostly affected the batsmen but Zaheer Khan missed the ODI series. [23] India won the first three ODIs, and Sharma was called into the team for the fourth, his first ODI since August 2010. [24] [25] He managed one wicket from two matches in the series while conceding 109 runs. [26] The first Test resulted in a win for India and Sharma took three wickets in each innings. [27] He claimed his 100th Test wicket in the second Test, becoming the fifth youngest to reach the landmark; the fixture was also the first time he took ten wickets in a match for India. [28] [29] The second and thirdalm. Mushtaq resigned, and the country was placed under temporary martial law, with three service chiefs serving as deputies to the new president, Justice Abu Sayem, who also became the Chief Martial Law Administrator. Lieutenant General Ziaur Rahman took over the presidency in 1977 when Justice Sayem resigned. President Zia reinstated multi-party politics, introduced free markets, and founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Zia's rule ended when he was assassinated by elements of the military in 1981. [61] Bangladesh's next major ruler was Lieutenant General Hossain Mohammad Ershad , who gained power in a coup on 24 March 1982, and ruled until 6 December 1990, when he was forced to resign after a revolt of all major political parties and the public, along with pressure from Western donors (which was a major shift in international policy after the fall of the Soviet Union).
Lt General Ziaur Rahman served as President (1977–1981) and CMLA (1977–1979)
Since then, Bangladesh has reverted to a parliamentary democracy. Zia's widow, Khaleda Zia , led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to parliamentary victory at the general election in 1991 and became the first female Prime Minister in Bangladeshi history. The fifth parliamentary brings Bangladesh nationalist party with Khaleda Zia, and a parliament system was set in place. However, the Awami League, headed by Sheikh Hasina , one of Mujib's surviving daughters, won the next election in 1996. The Awami League lost again to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in 2001. Widespread political unrest followed the resignation of the BNP in late October 2006, but the caretaker government worked to bring the parties to election within the required ninety days. At the last minute in early January, the Awami League withdrew from the election scheduled for later that month. On 11 January 2007, the military intervened to support both a state of emergency and a continuing but neutral caretaker government under a newly appointed Chief Advisor , who was not a politician. The country had suffered for decades from extensive corruption, [62] disorder, and political violence. The caretaker government worked to root out corruption from all levels of government. It arrested on corruption charges more than 160 people, including politicians, civil servants, and businessmen, among whom were both major party leaders, some of their senior staff, and two sons of Khaleda Zia.
After working to clean up the system, the caretaker government held what was described by observers as a largely free and fair election on 29 December 2008. [63] The Awami League's Sheikh Hasina won with a two-thirds landslide in the elections; she took the oath of Prime Minister on 6 January 2009. [64]
Geography
Main article: Geography of Bangladesh
Satellite image of Bangladesh from space, including Ganges Delta , the world's largest delta with its three distributaries- Padma , Meghna and Jamuna
The geography of Bangladesh is divided between three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges-Brahmaputra delta . The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges. The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name Padma or Pôdda), Brahmaputra ( Jamuna or Jomuna), and Meghna rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal . The alluvial soil deposited by the rivers when they overflow their banks has created some of the most fertile plains in the world. Bangladesh has 57 trans-boundary rivers , making water issues politically complicated to resolve – in most cases as the lower riparian state to India. [65]
The country is predominated by rich fertile flat land. Most parts of Bangladesh are less than 12 m (39.4 ft) above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of the land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 m (3.28 ft). [66] 17% of the country is covered by forests and 12% is covered by hill systems. The country's haor wetlands are of significant importance to global environmental science.
In southeastern Bangladesh, experiments have been done since the 1960s to 'build with nature'. Construction of cross dams has induced a natural accretion of silt, creating new land. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began promoting the development of this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has become a multiagency endeavor, building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some 27,000 acres (10,927 ha) to 21,000 families. [67] With an elevation of 1,064 m (3,491 ft), the highest peak of Bangladesh is Saka Haphong , on the border with Myanmar .
Climate
Main article: Climate of Bangladesh
Sundarbans , the largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site
Straddling the Tropic of Cancer , Bangladesh's climate is tropical with a mild winter from October to March, and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below 0 °C, with a record low of 1.1 °C in the north west city of Dinajpur on 3 February 1905. [68] A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such as floods , tropical cyclones , tornadoes , and tidal bores occur almost every year, [69] combined with the effects of deforestation , soil degradation and erosion . The cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating. A cyclone that struck Bangladesh in 1991 killed some 140,000 people. [70]
In September 1998, Bangladesh saw the most severe flooding in modern world history. As the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and Meghna spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, 9,700 km (6,000 mi) of road and 2,700 km (1,700 mi) of embankment, 1,000 people were killed and 30 million more were made homeless, with 135,000 cattle killed, 50 km2 (19 sq mi) of land destroyed and 11,000 km (6,800 mi) of roads damaged or destroyed. Two-thirds of the country was underwater. There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding. Firstly, there were unusually high monsoon rains. Secondly, the Himalayas shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Thirdly, trees that usually would have intercepted rain water had been cut down for firewood or to make space for animals. [71]

Bangladesh is now widely recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change . Natural hazards that come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health and shelter. [72] It is believed that in the coming decades the rising sea level alone will create more than 20 million [73] climate refugees . [74] Bangladeshi water is contaminated with arsenic frequently because of the high arsenic contents in the soil. Up to 77 million people are exposed to toxic arsenic from drinking water. [75] [76] Bangladesh is among the countries most prone to natural floods , tornados and cyclones . [77] [78] Also, there is evidence that earthquakes pose a threat to the country. Evidence shows that tectonics have caused rivers to shift course suddenly and dramatically. It has been shown that rainy-season flooding in Bangladesh, on the world's largest river delta, can push the underlying crust down by as much as 6 centimetres, and possibly perturb faults. [79]

Melbourne Landing, 1840; watercolour by W. Liardet (1840)
Before the arrival of European settlers, the area was occupied for an estimated 31,000 to 40,000 years. [22] At the time of European settlement, it was inhabited by under 20,000 [23] hunter-gatherers from three indigenous regional tribes : the Wurundjeri , Boonwurrung and Wathaurong . [24] The area was an important meeting place for the clans of the Kulin nation alliance and a vital source of food and water. [25] [26]
The first European settlement in Victoria was established by Colonel David Collins in October 1803, at Sullivan Bay , near present-day Sorrento , but this settlement was relocated to what is now Hobart , Tasmania, in February 1804, due to a perceived lack of resources. It would be 30 years before another settlement was attempted. [27]
In May and June 1835, the area which is now central and northern Melbourne was explored by John Batman , a leading member of the Port Phillip Association in Van Diemen's Land (now known as Tasmania), who claimed to have negotiated a purchase of 600,000 acres (2,400 km2) with eight Wurundjeri elders. [25] [26] Batman selected a site on the northern bank of the Yarra River, declaring that "this will be the place for a village". [28] Batman then returned to Launceston in Tasmania. In early August 1835 a different group of settlers, including John Pascoe Fawkner , left Launceston on the ship Enterprize . Fawkner was forced to disembark at Georgetown, Tasmania, because of outstanding debts. The remainder of the party continued and arrived at the mouth of the Yarra River on 15 August 1835. On 30 August 1835 the party disembarked and established a settlement at the site of the current Melbourne Immigration Museum. Batman and his group arrived on 2 September 1835 and the two groups ultimately agreed to share the settlement.
Batman's Treaty with the Aborigines was annulled by the New South Wales governor (who at the time governed all of eastern mainland Australia), with compensation paid to members of the association. [25] In 1836, Governor Bourke declared the city the administrative capital of the Port Phillip District of New South Wales, and commissioned the first plan for the city, the Hoddle Grid , in 1837. [29] The settlement was named Batmania after Batman. However, later that year the settlement was named "Melbourne" after the British Prime Minister , William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne , whose seat was Melbourne Hall in the market town of Melbourne , Derbyshire . On 13 April 1837, the settlement's general post office was officially opened with that name. [30]
Between 1836 and 1842, Victorian Aboriginal groups were largely dispossessed of their land. [31] By January 1844, there were said to be 675 Aborigines resident in squalid camps in Melbourne. [32] The British Colonial Office appointed five Aboriginal Protectors for the Aborigines of Victoria, in 1839, however their work was nullified by a land policy that favoured squatters to take possession of Aboriginal lands. [33] By 1845, fewer than 240 wealthy Europeans held all the pastoral licences then issued in Victoria and became a powerful political and economic force in Victoria for generations to come. [34]
Melbourne was declared a city by letters patent of Queen Victoria , issued on 25 June 1847. [12]
On 1 July 1851, the Port Phillip District became the separate Colony of Victoria, with Melbourne as its capital. [35]
Victorian gold rush[ edit ]
Further information: Victorian gold rush
"Canvas Town", South Melbourne in the 1850s depicting temporary accommodation for the thousands who poured into Melbourne each week during the gold rush.
The discovery of gold in Victoria in mid 1851 led to the Victorian gold rush , and Melbourne, which served as the major port and provided most services for the region, experienced rapid growth. Within months, the city's population had increased by nearly three-quarters, from 25,000 to 40,000 inhabitants. [36] Thereafter, growth was exponential and by 1865, Melbourne had overtaken Sydney as Australia's most populous city. [37] Additionally, Melbourne along with the Victorian regional cities of Ballarat and Geelong became the wealthiest cities in the world during the Gold Rush era.
An influx of interstate and overseas migrants, particularly Irish, German and Chinese, saw the development of slums including a temporary "tent city" established on the southern banks of the Yarra. Chinese migrants founded the Melbourne Chinatown in 1851, which remains the longest continuous Chinese settlement in the Western World. [38] In the aftermath of the Eureka Stockade , mass public support for the plight of the miners resulted in major political changes to the colony, including changes to working conditions across local industries including mining, agriculture and manufacturing. The nationalities involved in the Eureka revolt and Burke and Wills expedition gave an indication of immigration flows in the second half of the nineteenth century. [39]
With the wealth brought on by the gold rush following closely on the heels of the establishment of Victoria as a separate colony and the subsequent need for public buildings, a program of grand civic construction soon began. The 1850s and 1860s saw the commencement of Parliament House , the Treasury Building , the Old Melbourne Gaol , Victoria Barracks , the State Library , University , General Post Office , Customs House , the Melbourne Town Hall , St Patrick's cathedral, though many remained uncompleted for decades, with some still not finished.
The layout of the inner suburbs on a largely one-mile grid pattern, cut through by wide radial boulevards, and string of gardens surrounding the central city was largely established in the 1850s and 1860s. These areas were rapidly filled from the mid 1850s by the ubiquitous terrace house, as well as detached houses and some grand mansions in large grounds, while some of the major roads developed as shopping streets. Melbourne quickly became a major finance centre, home to several banks, the Royal Mint , and Australia's first stock exchange in 1861. [40] In 1855 the Melbourne Cricket Club secured possession of its now famous ground, the MCG . Members of the Melbourne Football Club codified Australian football in 1859, and Yarra rowing clubs and "regattas" became popular about the same time. In 1861 the Melbourne Cup was first run. In 1864 Melbourne acquired its first public monument—the Burke and Wills statue.
With the gold rush largely over by 1860, Melbourne continued to grow on the back of continuing gold mining, as the major port for exporting the agricultural products of Victoria, especially wool, and a developing manufacturing sector protected by high tariffs. An extensive radial railway network centred on Melbourne and spreading out across the suburbs and into the countryside was established from the late 1850s. Further major public buildings were begun in the 1860s and 1870s such as the Supreme Court , Government House , and the Queen Victoria Market . The central city filled up with shops and offices, workshops, and warehouses. Large banks and hotels faced the main streets, with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street, contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks. The Aboriginal population continued to decline with an estimated 80% total decrease by 1863, due primarily to introduced diseases, particularly smallpox , [23] frontier violence and dispossession from their lands.
Land boom and bust[ edit ]
Lithograph of the Royal Exhibition Building , built to host the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880
The decade of the 1880s was one of extraordinary growth, when consumer confidence, easy access to credit, and steep increases in the price of land, led to an enormous amount of construction. This 'land boom' was followed by a severe economic crash in the early 1890s which lasted until the end of the century. During the boom, Melbourne had reputedly become the richest city in the world, [13] and the largest after London in the British Empire .[ citation needed ]
The decade began with the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880, held in the large purpose-built Exhibition Building . In 1880 a telephone exchange was established and in the same year the foundations of St Paul's , were laid; in 1881 electric light was installed in the Eastern Market, and in the following year a generating station capable of supplying 2,000 incandescent lamps was in operation. [41] In 1885 the first line of the Melbourne cable tramway system was built, becoming one of the worlds most extensive systems by 1890.
Federal Coffee Palace, one of many grand hotels erected during the boom
During a visit in 1885 English journalist George Augustus Henry Sala coined the phrase "Marvellous Melbourne", which stuck long into the twentieth century and is still used today by Melburnians. [42] Growing building activity culminated in a "land boom" which, in 1888, reached a peak of speculative development fuelled by consumer confidence and escalating land value. [43] As a result of the boom, large commercial buildings, coffee palaces , terrace housing and palatial mansions proliferated in the city. [43] The establishment of a hydraulic facility in 1887 allowed for the local manufacture of elevators, resulting in the first construction of high-rise buildings; [44] most notably the APA (The Australian) Building, amongst the world's tallest commercial buildings upon completion in 1889. [43] This period also saw the expansion of a major radial rail-based transport network. [45]
In 1888, the Exhibition Building hosted a second event even larger than the first, the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, spurring construction of numerous hotels including the 500 room Federal Hotel , The Palace Hotel in Bourke Street (both since demolished), and the doubling in size of the Grand (Windsor) .
A brash boosterism that had typified Melbourne during this time ended in the early 1890s with a severe depression of the city's economy, sending the local finance and property industries into a period of chaos [43] [46] during which 16 small "land banks" and building societies collapsed, and 133 limited companies went into liquidation. The Melbourne financial crisis was a contributing factor in the Australian economic depression of the 1890s and the Australian banking crisis of 1893 . The effects of the depression on the city were profound, with virtually no new construction until the late 1890s. [47] [48]
Federation of Australia[ edit ]
The Big Picture , the opening of the first Parliament of Australia on 9 May 1901, painted by Tom Roberts .
At the time of Australia's federation on 1 January 1901, Melbourne became the seat of government of the federation. The first federal parliament was convened on 9 May 1901 in the Royal Exhibition Building, subsequently moving to the Victorian Parliament House where it was located until 1927, when it was moved to Canberra . The Governor-General of Australia resided at Government House in Melbourne until 1930 and many major national institutions remained in Melbourne well into the twentieth century. [49]
Federation Square in Melbourne's CBD was opened to mark the 100 year anniversary of Federation in Australia.
Post-war period[ edit ]
In the immediate years after World War II, Melbourne expanded rapidly, its growth boosted by Post war immigration to Australia , primarily from Southern Europe and the Mediterranean . [50] While the "Paris End" of Collins Street began Melbourne's boutique shopping and open air cafe cultures, [51] the city centre was seen by many as stale—the dreary domain of office workers—something expressed by John Brack in his famous painting Collins St., 5 pm (1955). [52]
Height limits in the Melbourne CBD were lifted in 1958, after the construction of ICI House , transforming the city's skyline with the introduction of skyscrapers. Suburban expansion then intensified, serviced by new indoor malls beginning with Chadstone Shopping Centre . [53] The post-war period also saw a major renewal of the CBD and St Kilda Road which significantly modernised the city. [54] New fire regulations and redevelopment saw most of the taller pre-war CBD buildings either demolished or partially retained through a policy of facadism . Many of the larger suburban mansions from the boom era were also either demolished or subdivided.
To counter the trend towards low-density suburban residential growth, the government began a series of controversial public housing projects in the inner city by the Housing Commission of Victoria , which resulted in demolition of many neighbourhoods and a proliferation of high-rise towers. [55] In later years, with the rapid rise of motor vehicle ownership, the investment in freeway and highway developments greatly accelerated the outward suburban sprawl and declining inner city population. The Bolte government sought to rapidly accelerate the modernisation of Melbourne. Major road projects including the remodelling of St Kilda Junction , the widening of Hoddle Street and then the extensive 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan changed the face of the city into a car-dominated environment. [56]
Australia's financial and mining booms between 1969 and 1970 resulted in establishment of the headquarters of many major companies ( BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto , among others) in the city. Nauru 's then booming economy resulted in several ambitious investments in Melbourne, such as Nauru House . [57] Melbourne remained Australia's main business and financial centre until the late 1970s, when it began to lose this primacy to Sydney. [58]
As the centre of Australia's " rust belt ", Melbourne experienced an economic downturn between 1989 to 1992, following the collapse of several local financial institutions. In 1992 the newly elected Kennett government began a campaign to revive the economy with an aggressive development campaign of public works coupled with the promotion of the city as a tourist destination with a focus on major events and sports tourism. [59] During this period the Australian Grand Prix moved to Melbourne from Adelaide. Major projects included the construction of a new facility for the Melbourne Museum , Federation Square , the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre , Crown Casino and the CityLink tollway . Other strategies included the privatisation of some of Melbourne's services, including power and public transport, and a reduction in funding to public services such as health, education and public transport infrastructure. [60]
Contemporary Melbourne[ edit ]
Since the mid-1990s, Melbourne has maintained significant population and employment growth. There has been substantial international investment in the city's industries and property market. Major inner-city urban renewal has occurred in areas such as Southbank , Port Melbourne , Melbourne Docklands and more recently, South Wharf . According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics , Melbourne sustained the highest population increase and economic growth rate of any Australian capital city in the three years ended June 2004. [61] These factors have led to population growth and further suburban expansion through the 2000s.

From 2006, the growth of the city extended into "green wedges" and beyond the city's urban growth boundary . Predictions of the city's population reaching 5 million people pushed the state government to review the growth boundary in 2008 as part of its Melbourne @ Five Million strategy. [62] In 2009, Melbourne was less affected by the Late-2000s financial crisis in comparison to other Australian cities. At this time, more new jobs were created in Melbourne than any other Australian city—almost as many as the next two fastest growing cities, Brisbane and Perth, combined, [63] and Melbourne's property market remained strong, [64] resulting in historically high property prices and widespread rent increases. [65]
Main article: Geography of Melbourne
Map of Melbourne and Geelong urban areas
Melbourne is located in the south-eastern part of mainland Australia, within the state of Victoria . Geologically, it is built on the confluence of Quaternary lava flows to the west, Silurian mudstones to the east, and Holocene sand accumulation to the southeast along Port Phillip . The southeastern suburbs are situated on the Selwyn fault which transects Mount Martha and Cranbourne .
Melbourne extends along the Yarra River towards the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong Ranges to the east. It extends northward through the undulating bushland valleys of the Yarra's tributaries— Moonee Ponds Creek (toward Tullamarine Airport), Merri Creek , Darebin Creek and Plenty River —to the outer suburban growth corridors of Craigieburn and Whittlesea .
The city reaches south-east through Dandenong to the growth corridor of Pakenham towards West Gippsland , and southward through the Dandenong Creek valley, the Mornington Peninsula and the city of Frankston taking in the peaks of Olivers Hill , Mount Martha and Arthurs Seat , extending along the shores of Port Phillip as a single conurbation to reach the exclusive suburb of Portsea and Point Nepean . In the west, it extends along the Maribyrnong River and its tributaries north towards Sunbury and the foothills of the Macedon Ranges , and along the flat volcanic plain country towards Melton in the west, Werribee at the foothills of the You Yangs granite ridge south west of the CBD. The Little River, and the township of the same name, marks the border between Melbourne and neighbouring Geelong city.
Melbourne's major bayside beaches are located in the various suburbs along the shores of Port Phillip Bay, in areas like Port Melbourne , Albert Park , St Kilda , Elwood , Brighton , Sandringham , Mentone , Frankston , Altona , Williamstown and Werribee South. The nearest surf beaches are located 85 kilometres (53 mi) south-east of the Melbourne CBD in the back-beaches of Rye , Sorrento and Portsea . [66] [67]

In the early days of cricket, underarm bowling was the only method employed. Many theories exist about the origins of cricket. One suggests that the game began among shepherds hitting a stone or a ball of wool with their crooks and, at the same time, defending the wicket gate into the sheep-fold (from Anglo Saxon 'cricce', a crooked staff). A second theory suggests the name came from a low stool known as a 'cricket' in England, which from the side looked like the long, low wicket used in the early days of the game (originally from the Flemish 'krickstoel', a low stool on which parishioners knelt in church). There is also a reference to 'criquet' in North-East France in 1478 and evidence that the game evolved in South-East England in the Middle Ages .
In 1706 William Goldwyn published the first description of the game. He wrote that two teams were first seen carrying their curving bats to the venue, choosing a pitch and arguing over the rules to be played. They pitched two sets of wickets, each with a "milk-white" bail perched on two stumps; toss a coin for first knock, the umpire called "play" and the "leathern orb" was bowled. They had four-ball overs, the umpires leant on their staves (which the batters had to touch to complete a run), and the scorers sat on a mound making notches.
The first written " Laws of Cricket " were drawn up in 1744. They stated, "the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes. The stumps must be 22 inches high and the bail across them six inches. The ball must be between 5 & 6 ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22 yards apart". There were no limits on the shape or size of the bat. It appears that 40 notches was viewed as a very big score, probably due to the bowlers bowling quickly at shins unprotected by pads. The world's first cricket club was formed in Hambledon in the 1760s and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was founded in 1787.
During the 1760s and 1770s it became common to pitch the ball through the air, rather than roll it along the ground. This innovation gave bowlers the weapons of length, deception through the air, plus increased pace. It also opened new possibilities for spin and swerve. In response, batters had to master timing and shot selection. One immediate consequence was the replacement of the curving bat with the straight one. All of this raised the premium on skill and lessened the influence of rough ground and brute force. It was in the 1770s that the modern game began to take shape. The weight of the ball was limited to between five and a half and five and three-quarter ounces, and the width of the bat to four inches. The latter ruling followed an innings by a batter called Thomas "Daddy" White , who appeared with a bat the width of the wicket. In 1774, the first leg before law was published. Also around this time, a third stump became commonplace. By 1780, three days had become the duration of a major match, and this year also saw the creation of the first six-seam cricket ball. In 1788, the MCC published its first revision of the laws, which prohibited charging down an opponent and also provided for mowing and covering the wicket in order to standardise conditions. The desire for standardisation reflected the massive increase in the popularity of cricket during the 18th century. Between 1730 and 1740, 150 cricket matches were recorded in the papers of the time. Between 1750 and 1760, this figure rose to 230, and between 1770 and 1790 over 500.
The 19th century saw a series of significant changes. Wide deliveries were outlawed in 1811. The circumference of the ball was specified for the first time in 1838 (its weight had been dictated 60 years earlier). Pads, made of cork, became available for the first time in 1841, and these were further developed following the invention of vulcanised rubber, which was also used to introduce protective gloves in 1848. In the 1870s, boundaries were introduced – previously, all hits had to be run; if the ball went into the crowd, the spectators would clear a way for the fieldsman to fetch it. The biggest change, however, was in how the ball was delivered by the bowler.
At the start of the century, all bowlers were still delivering the ball under-arm. However, so the story goes, John Willes became the first bowler to use a "round-arm" technique after practising with his sister Christina, who had used the technique, as she was unable to bowl underarm due to her wide dress impeding her delivery of the ball. [5]
The round-arm action came to be employed widely in matches but was quickly determined to be illegal and banned by the MCC, who stated that "the ball must be delivered underhand, not thrown or jerked, with the hand underneath the elbow at the time of delivering the ball". [6] When it was accepted the rules stated that the arm could not be raised above the shoulder. It was quickly found, however, that a raised arm imparted more accuracy and generated more bounce than the roundarm method. Again, the governing body banned the method. It was not until the method was finally accepted by the MCC in 1835 [7] that it grew rapidly in popularity amongst all players. Underarm bowling hitherto had almost disappeared from the game.
Modern-day underarm bowling[ edit ]
An infamous " underarm bowling incident " occurred during a match in 1981, in which the Australian bowler, Trevor Chappell, took advantage of the fact that underarm bowling was still legal by rolling the ball along the ground. By doing so he avoided the possibility that the New Zealand batsman, Brian McKechnie, would score a six from the last ball to tie the match, as the bat would not be able to hit the ball high enough to score a six. [8]
As a result of this incident underarm bowling was subsequently made illegal in all grades of cricket, except by prior agreement of both teams, as it was not considered to be within the spirit of the game
The bowling action[ edit ]
The typical bowling action of a fast bowler.
Bowling the ball is distinguished from simply throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition.
Originally, this definition said that the elbow joint must not straighten out during the bowling action. Bowlers generally hold their elbows fully extended and rotate the arm vertically about the shoulder joint to impart velocity to the ball, releasing it near the top of the arc. Flexion at the elbow is not allowed, but any extension of the elbow was deemed to be a throw and would be liable to be called a no ball. This was thought to be possible only if the bowler's elbow was originally held in a slightly flexed position.
In 2005, this definition was deemed to be physically impossible by a scientific investigative commission. Biomechanical studies that showed that almost all bowlers extend their elbows somewhat throughout the bowling action, because the stress of swinging the arm around hyperextends the elbow joint. A guideline was introduced to allow extensions or hyperextensions of angles up to 15 degrees before deeming the ball illegally thrown.
Bowling actions are typically divided into side on and front on actions. In the side on action, the back foot lands parallel to the bowling crease and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking over his front shoulder. In the front on action, the back foot lands pointing down the pitch and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking inside the line of his front arm. Many bowlers operate with a mid-way action with the back foot landing at roughly 45 degrees and the upper body aligned somewhere between side on and front on. This is not to be confused with a mixed action, which mixes distinct elements of both side on and front on actions, and is generally discouraged amongst young bowlers as it can lead to problems in later life due to the twisting of the back inherent in the action.

Goals of bowling[ edit ]
In a game of cricket, the ultimate priority of the fielding side is to restrict the total number of runs scored by the batting side, and the actions of the bowlers will be fundamental to achieving this objective. The primary means of achieving this is by dismissing the batting side by getting all ten of the opposition wickets as quickly as possible. A secondary objective will be to keep the batting side's run rate as low as possible. In fact, in most forms of cricket, the twin aims of the fielding side are targeted concurrently, as the achievement of one aim tends to have a positive effect upon the other. Taking regular opposition wickets will remove the better batsmen from the crease, typically leading to a slowing of the scoring rate. Conversely, slowing the scoring rate can put additional pressure on the batsmen and force them into taking extra risks, which will often lead to wickets.
Depending upon the format of the match, these two strategies will be given different weights. In an unlimited, timed or declaration match, the main aim of the bowling attack will be to take wickets, so attacking bowling and fielding strategies will be used. In a limited overs match, this aim will also be supplemented by the secondary need to prevent the batting side from scoring quickly, so more defensive strategies will be used. In general, the shorter the number of overs per side, the more priority will be given to this secondary target of maintaining a low run-rate. It is also highly probable that the need for attacking or defensive strategies can switch frequently as a cricket match progresses. It is the sign of a good cricket captain to be able to tell which strategy is most appropriate in any set of circumstances and the best way of implementing it.
Bowling tactics[ edit ]

The simultaneous twin objectives of bowling are to take wickets and prevent run scoring opportunities. Both objectives are achieved through the underlying aim of bowling the ball in such a way that the batsman is unable to connect with the ball in the middle of the bat and control its movement after contact. There are three distinct means of achieving this aim: by bowling the ball on a good line and length, by bowling with sufficient pace that the batsman struggles to react to the delivery, or by bowling the ball in such a way that it has lateral movement as it approaches the batsman, either in the air or off the ground. A good bowler may be able to combine two of these skills, a truly great bowler may be able to combine all three.
Line and length[ edit ]
The fundamental skill of bowling on a good length incorporates the ability to pitch the ball such a distance from the batsman that he is unable to move forward and drive the ball on the half volley, and is also unable to step back and play the ball on the back foot. This removes many of the batsman's attacking options, and also increases the probability of him misjudging a delivery and losing his wicket. A good length delivery is one in which the ball has had sufficient time to move far enough off the pitch to beat the bat but the batsman has not had time to react to the movement and adjust his shot. The faster the bowler and the greater the movement he is able to generate, the larger the area of the pitch that can be designated an effective "good" length.
Other areas of the pitch may also often be used as a variation to a good length delivery. Primarily these are the yorker , in which the ball is bowled directly at the batsman's feet as a surprise delivery intended to dismiss the batsman bowled , and the bouncer in which the ball is bowled on such a short length that it rises towards the batsman's throat or head as a means of physical intimidation. But the height of an attempted yorker or full toss must not be higher than the batsman's waist, or else in will be called a no ball beamer , which could have bowlers banned from the match.
The line a bowler chooses to bowl will depend on several factors: the movement he is generating on the ball, the shots the batsman is able to play, and the field the captain has set. The two most common tactics are to either bowl directly at the stumps, or to bowl 3 inches to 6 inches outside the line of off stump. Bowling at the stumps is an attacking tactic with the intention of dismissing the batsman bowled or lbw . It can also be used as a defensive tactic, as the batsman will feel less able to play risky shots knowing that he will be dismissed should he miss the ball. Bowling outside off stump is known as the corridor of uncertainty. When done well, this line may confuse the batsman into whether to defend the ball or leave it, and may tempt him to play away from his body with his head not in line with the ball. The main aim of this tactic is to dismiss the batman caught by the wicketkeeper or in the slips . Other bowling variations, such as bowling wide of off stump or bowling at leg stump are generally seen as negative and defensive tactics.
Some different types of bowling tactic:

He featured for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2009.
He was signed up by the IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2013. In a line-up comprising Dale Steyn , Thisara Perera and Amit Mishra , young Sharma was the bowler the opposition batsmen were expected to target.
He responded with a mature performance. His performance against Kings XI Punjab early on in the tournament was ample proof of his potential, as he beat the Kings XI batsmen with his spin.
He fortified an already strong bowling attack with a decent economy rate and was a good foil to Amit Mishra , the senior legspinner in the side. When he was given the chance also contributed with the bat scoring a stubborn unbeaten 39 when Sunrisers Hyderabad was staring at their first home defeat against Chennai Super Kings .
In 2014 IPL auctions, he was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs 3.75 crore, in a bidding war with Kings XI Punjab. He was the highest paid uncapped Indian player in IPL 2014.
In 2015, he was retained by the Sunrisers Hyderabad and he plays as the lead spin bowler for the team.
Style[ edit ]
He has a busy action and many deliveries make batsmen hurry their shots. But most importantly, he seems to be able to bowl a big legbreak.

West Indies v India, 2nd Test, Bridgetown, 3rd day June 30, 2011
Ishant cherishes success after gloom
49 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comment

It's easy to forget Ishant Sharma is just 22. He's had so many ups and downs already. He's experienced not just dips in form but long, barren stretches of gloom. On Thursday, he grabbed his 100th Test wicket in his 32nd Test, statistics that surprised some, including himself. "In the last one-and-a-half years I have been struggling with my bowling," Ishant said. "When I started to play cricket, I didn't expect to be the fifth-youngest bowler to take 100 wickets."
Ishant's decline from the heights of that spell against Ricky Ponting in Perth is well known. He never had a smooth follow-through to start with, and then began to stutter even further. That was just the beginning of the nightmare. The release gradually turned awry. The wrist that was so firmly behind the seam was finding its way into awkward positions. While at his best, his lithe fingers whipped the ball on to the deck. In his decline, he merely floated the ball across. The left shoulder fell away alarmingly. The head was no longer still. Ishant's life as a bowler was falling apart in front of his eyes.
"Everyone told me there will be ups and downs in any sportsman's life," Ishant said. "I have age on my side. I just had to work on my bowling and my fitness. That's what I did. Us time sabse jyaada difficulty tha ki koi kuch nahi poochta hai; aap kahan pey ho, kya kar rahe ho. (No one was asking about you: what are you doing, where are you?) My family's support was really helpful at the time."
Only time will tell whether Ishant Sharma is back to his best © AFP
Ishant admitted he hadn't been listening to his mentors, including Zaheer Khan. "I'd like to thank Zaheer for [his advice on] fitness. He always used to tell me about fitness but I didn't take him seriously because I didn't think fitness was that important. Now I have realised it is. If you want to be a fast bowler, you've got to be fit."
Why did he lose his pace? Ishant didn't elaborate, and the press conference didn't offer enough time for probing, but he said he "maybe tried to copy someone else," but added, "now I have learned that whatever is my strength, I should stick to it. And be fit."
Ishant also showed signs of maturity when bowling during his six-wicket haul, a departure from the times when the aim was to just bowl quick. His duel with Ramnaresh Sarwan offered sufficient proof. Ishant kept pushing Sarwan back with his short-of-length deliveries before getting one to pitch fuller and cut in and trap him in front.
"Now, I think more," he said. "I have plans against each batsman; where and what you should bowl at different batsmen. I don't know what was going wrong at that time. Now I am looking to go out there and follow whatever plans we have - visualise and think about what you are going to bowl."
Ishant also had problems bowling different lengths in ODIs. "You have to be clever when you are bowling in Powerplays and in the slog overs. I wasn't that clever before. Now I am learning [about] my bowling and body. I hope I will come back into ODI side and bowl well whenever my team needs me."
Ishant has had to lead the pace attack in the absence of Zaheer and Munaf Patel, a role he has taken a liking to. "I am enjoying the responsibility. MS bhai [Dhoni] has given me the fields I want. I talk to Harbhajan [Singh] about all my field plans and what I am going to bowl at each batsman."
Only time will tell whether Ishant is back to his best, but he said he is readier than ever, mentally and physically. "I learnt during this IPL that jo aap ho aapko vahi karna hai (you should stick to your strengths). I learnt how to recover from tiredness. You travel a lot during the IPL and I learnt more about my body and the importance of training."
It's slightly surprising that he learnt all that in his fourth IPL, but then sometimes you forget he is just 22.

Approach[ edit ]
The approach is the motion of the bowler prior to bowling the ball. It is also known as the run-up.
A spinner's approach differs from that of a medium pace or fast bowler, but certain principles remain the same:
Balance: lack of balance in the approach translates into lack of balance in the later stages of the action and so absence of accuracy.
Consistency: a consistent approach allows the later phases of the bowling action to be consistent. Moreover, inconsistency is likely to lead to bowling no-balls.
Head still and upright.
The strides of the bound, back foot contact, front foot contact and the first stride of the follow through should all be in line in order to give a balanced action that flows towards the target. Medium pace and quick bowlers usually employ a straight approach that is aligned toward the target. Spin bowlers, on the other hand, tend to have more varied approaches.
Other recommended elements of the approach are:
Starting with shorter strides then lengthening to cruise in to the bound.
Leaning slightly forward, running on the balls of the feet.
Running with the hands pumping, tucked into the side. This tucked in run up is intended to set the pattern for the whole delivery, keeping everything in a tight corridor flowing towards the target. Some bowlers choose to sacrifice this in order to cover the ball with the non-bowling hand in order to disguise the grip.
Long enough to hit the desired cruise speed and arrive balanced at the bound. Some bowlers, especially chest on bowlers tend to run through the crease. This adds the speed of the approach to the speed at which the ball is released. In contrast, side on bowlers tend to be more similar to javelin throwers. The lower part of their body brakes between front foot contact and point of release causing a whip like effect. Hence side on bowlers tend to have slower approaches.
Bound[ edit ]
The bound is a jump that allows the bowler to transition from the run-up to the back foot contact position. For a chest on bowler not much transition is needed. So, many chest on bowlers have a low, short bound. In contrast, side on bowlers need to rotate their bodies through ninety degrees and so tend to have a longer, higher bound. A high bound can lead to the knee on the back foot collapsing and so lose momentum.
Delivery stride[ edit ]
Delivery stride is the stride during which the delivery swing is made, whether the ball is released or not. It starts when the bowler’s back foot lands for that stride and ends when the front foot lands in the same stride. [1]
Back foot contact[ edit ]
Back foot contact is position of the bowler at the instant when the back foot lands on the ground just prior to delivering the ball. For a right-handed bowler, the back foot is normally the right foot.
An alternative name for back foot contact is coil.
Alignment
To avoid back injury it is important that the hips and shoulders are aligned at back foot contact. This can be done in any of the following positions:
Side on: the back foot is parallel to the bowling crease causing the hips to be side on. The non bowling arm is positioned in front of head so causing the shoulders to align with the hips. A classic example of a side on bowler is Dennis Lillee .
Chest on: the back foot points straight down the track towards the target, aligning the hips parallel to the bowling crease. The non bowling arm is positioned to the side of the head. This aligns the shoulders and chest paralle Tests ended in draws and India won the series 1–0; [30] Sharma was the leading wicket-taker on either side with 22 dismissals at an average of 16.86. [31]
After the tour of West Indies, India suffer a run of eight consecutive defeats in away Tests. In July and August the team played four Tests in England . England inflicted a 4–0 whitewash on India, [32] and in the process replaced India as No. 1 ranked Test team. [33] Playing in all four matches, Sharma managed 11 wickets at an average pushing 60. [34] During the series Sharma suffered an anckle injury and missed the ODI leg, but was sufficiently reovered to face the West Indies in November when India hosted them for three Tests. [35] While India won 2–0, Sharma managed five wickets from three matches at a cost of in excess of 65 runs each. [36] Sharma played in all four Tests of India's tour of Australia in 2011–12 . India lost the series 4–0, while Sharma took five wickets at the cost of 451 runs. [37]
In March 2012, Sharma underwent surgery on his ankle which had been troubling him for over a year. The operation meant that he missed the 2012 IPL. [38]
In 2013 Ind vs Aus ODI series, he gave away 30 runs in an over, equalling the most expensive over by an Indian bowler. (Yuvraj Singh had conceded 30 runs against England in an ODI match in 2007) [39]
After some bad performances against Australia in 2013 ODI series, he came back strongly against South Africa taking 4/40 in the third ODI on 11 December 2013 at SuperSport Park , which was his 2nd best performance in ODIs. [40]
In the 2014 tour of England , Sharma secured his career best figures of 7/74 at the Lord's , with an aggressive spell in England's second innings, bowling India to a 95-run win. [41] During the first test of the series, Sharma suffered the slight ignominy of becoming Alastair Cook 's sole Test wicket when caught down the leg side. [42] India finished the series losing 3–1. He finished the 2015 three-match Test series in Sri Lanka with 13 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul in the third Test at SSC . At the end of the match, he was handed a one match ban by the International Cricket Council (ICC), following an altercation with Dhammika Prasad in the course of the match. [43] The series also saw him pick his 200th wicket in Tests. [44] India won the series 2–1.
Bowling style
A right arm fast-medium bowler, the speed of Sharma's bowling has diminished since he emerged on the international scene, [45] although in 2008 he bowled a delivery at over 152 kilometres per hour (94 mph). [46] Such occurrences were not the norm as his pace dropped to around 130 km/h (81 mph), but under Eric Simons (who was India's bowling coach from 2010 to 2012) Sharma was regularly bowling in excess of 140 km/h (87 mph) when India toured Australia in 2011/12. [47] [48] According to India's former bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad he is amongst the most dedicated bowler in India's set up. [49]
Simons noted height was a factor in the length Sharma bowled, saying "For Ishant to hit the stumps, he has to pitch it fuller, and that means the batsman has more chance of keeping it out". [48] Former West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh identified two problems with Sharma's bowling action : his head drops when the ball is delivered and the position of his wrist varies. The first takes some of the speed out of the delivery, while the second reduces the chance of the ball seaming and swinging . The former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar suggested that the lack of movement in Sharma's bowling discouraged him from pitching the ball up so instead he tends to bowl short . The slower pace of his bowling when he pitches the ball up may explain why the yorker is not an effective delivery for him. Manjrekar went further, saying that "for all his talent and commitment he just does not take enough wickets"; when the remark was made in January 2012, Sharma had a bowling average of nearly 37 from 43 Tests.

History[ edit ]
Although the island was totally abandoned or uninhabited when the British landed there, one of the few traces of indigenous pre-existence on the island was a primitive bridge constructed over the Careenage area's swamp at the centre of Bridgetown. It was thought that this bridge was created by a people indigenous to the Caribbean known as the Arawak . Upon finding the structure, the British settlers began to call what is now the Bridgetown area Indian Bridge. Scholars widely believe that the Arawak were driven from Barbados to the neighbouring island of Saint Lucia , during an invasion by the Kalinagos , another indigenous people of the region. Eventually after 1654 when a new bridge was constructed over the Careenage by the British, the area became known as The Town of Saint Michael and later as Bridgetown.
Bridgetown is the only city outside the present United States that George Washington visited. ( George Washington House , the house where he stayed, is included within the boundaries of the Garrison Historic Area .) Two of Washington's ancestors, Jonathon and Gerrard Hawtaine, were early planters on the island. Their grandmother was Mary Washington of Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, England. In 2011, historic buildings in Bridgetown were designated as a protected area by UNESCO. [10]
Early settlement[ edit ]
English settlement of Bridgetown began on 5 July 1628 [11] under Charles Wolverstone , who brought with him 64 settlers to these lands formally claimed by James Hay, the Earl of Carlisle . Wolverstone, had been dispatched by a group of London Merchants, headed by Sir Marmaduke Rawdon . The group had been granted a lease [12] to 10,000 acres (40 km2) of land area by the Earl of Carlisle in settlement of debts. Each of the settlers with Wolverstone were granted by him 100 acres (0.40 km2) of land, lying on the northern side of the Careenage waterway for the purpose of general settlement. [11] The southern shore on Needham's Point, were claimed by Carlisle's agents that coming October, and in 1631, many acres of land directly facing Carlisle Bay were passed to Henry Hawley , the new Governor. Reports of dishonest behaviour about this Governor led to his arrest and rendition to England in 1639. After investigation by Commission in 1640, it was found that much of Hawley's land transactions were legitimate and properly showed these lands (including the town site), as being attributed to the Earl of Carlisle. Bridgetown was built upon a street layout resembling early English Medieval or market towns with its narrow serpentine street and alley configuration.
Boundaries[ edit ]
The earliest boundaries of Bridgetown are contained by way of an Act passed on 4 April 1660 called, "to prevent the danger which may happen by fire, in or about any of the seaport towns of the Island". [11] The southern limit was declared to be the River (Careenage), whilst the western limit was declared to be the western boundary of St. Michael's (now St. Mary's) Churchyard, and extending in a direct line to the seaside. The town's other limits consisted of properties of certain citizens' names in this statute, the location of which cannot now be determined with certainty. [11] The boundaries were not redefined until 1822.
From town to city[ edit ]
See also: Districts of Barbados § City of Bridgetown
In 1824, Barbados became the seat of the Anglican ' Diocese of Barbados and the Leeward Islands '. Due to this the Saint Michael's Parish Church became raised to the status of Cathedral, in so doing the elevation meant that thereafter Bridgetown would be conferred with city status . In 1842, Royal Letters Patent under which Barbados, Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada, Saint Vincent, and Saint Lucia were split into separate diocese decreed that henceforth the Town of Bridgetown should be called the City of Bridgetown. [13]
From 1800 until 1885, Bridgetown served as the main seat of Government for the former British colonies of the Windward Islands . During this period, the resident Governor of Barbados also served McCullum 's 158* and Murali Vijay 's 127. In his next game Paul scored a fabulous 75 of 47 deliveries hitting 5 sixes and 8 fours after achieving the best bowling figures for any Kings XI Punjab bowler with 4 for 29. His all round performance resulted in a big win for his team. [7] He played a pacey innings in his next match scoring 46 off just 31 [8] deliveries with three classic sixes. With his initial blitzkrieg, the team crossed the fifty in just three overs, a record in IPL history which was later beaten by the Royal Challengers Bangalore in their second match against the Kochi Tuskers Kerala in the same season.

14.2 to Marsh, Irfan takes out Shaun. It landed back of length and moved away from the off stump. Marsh went for a big flat-batted heave across the line and top edged it. Morne ran in from third man to collect it. 123/2
14.3 to Valthaty, A pumped-up Irfan  hops in joy. The off stump has gone for a night-out. It was the full delivery but Paul was so frozen on the back foot. He was perhaps again expecting a short ball. The ball curved in the air, landed full around off and darted back in. Paul was in panic mode by now; he  crouched and tried to stab it. No luck. The ball curved in, went through the bat and pad gap and took out the off stump 123/3
18.4 to Mandeep Singh, Clatter! Irfan pings the leg stump. Mandeep cleared his front foot and went for a big slog to the leg but missed the full delivery. 156/5



History[ edit ]
The Sawai Mansingh Stadium has hosted a solitary Test match, between India and Pakistan , starting in February 1987, when Pakistan President General Zia-ul-Haq crossed the border to watch the second day's play as part of his "Cricket for Peace" initiative.
The Test was notable for Younis Ahmed 's return to the Test fray after an absence of over 17 years and also for Sunil Gavaskar 's dismissal to the first ball of the Test match, for the third time in an otherwise illustrious career.
The game sputtered to a draw after the third day's play was abandoned following heavy rain and a controversy over the alleged deposition of sawdust on the wicket which Pakistan objected to.
The stadium's ODI debut had kicked off with a contest between the same two sides on 2 October 1983. Fresh from their World Cup triumph, the Indians comfortably won by four wickets, sporting the same XI that won the World Cup final.
The ground has also hosted two World Cup matches in 1987 and 1996 respectively, the West Indians losing to England in the former and beating Australia in the latter. The last ODI played on the ground is between India and Australia on October 2013 which they won comfortably by just losing one wicket chasing 362 in just 43.3 overs
The highest individual score by any batsman on this ground in ODIs is 183 (not out) by Mahendra Singh Dhoni .
This is also the venue in which Virat Kohli made the fastest 100 for India in ODIs as India chase total of 359 against Australia which was second highest successful chase in ODIs, after the Johannesburg epic between Australia and South Africa . [2]
Re-development[ edit ]
In 2006, the stadium underwent a major renovation at a cost of Rs 400 crore. [3] A world-class cricket academy was built for Rs 7 crore, which has 28 appointed rooms, a gym, a restaurant, 2 conference halls and a swimming pool. [4]

History[ edit ]
The Page playoff system was used at the Australian Rugby League Championship 1954-1972.
The system is now used by the International Softball Federation in world championship since 1990 and the Olympic Games 1996-2008. [2]
Its first use in curling was by the Canadian Curling Association in the 1995 Labatt Brier , [3] the men's championship, and was adopted the next year at the 1996 Scott Tournament of Hearts , the women's championship. [4] It gained acceptance and in 2005 the World Curling Championships started using it, but it has not yet been adopted in curling at the Olympic Games .
The format was used in the Indian Premier League cricket tournament since 2011. [5]
The format has also been used in some much lower-key, internet gaming events, such as chess [6] and backgammon. [7]
Format[ edit ]
The system requires teams to be ranked in some way, as the top two teams have an advantage over the bottom two. This is usually accomplished through a round-robin tournament, which eliminates all but the top four teams.
Round-robin[ edit ]
A standard round-robin tournament is used, in which all teams play each other once. Because the number of total games increases quadratically with respect to the number of teams, scheduling too many teams will result in an unwieldy number of games, particularly when there are a limited number of playing surfaces ( curling rinks usually only have four sheets ). Therefore, the number of teams is usually capped at around a dozen; if this is not possible or desirable, teams may be separated into groups playing separate round-robins and either having the top teams combining for the Page playoff or playing separate ones in each group and having the winners play each other after.
Page playoff system[ edit ]
The system was invented in Australia in the early 1930s and adopted soon after by the Victorian Football League (now known as the Australian Football League). The top four teams advance to the playoffs, which are played over three rounds with one team being eliminated in each round.[ citation needed ]
The format progresses as follows:
In Game 1, the third- and fourth-placed teams play against each other. The loser is eliminated.
In Game 2, the first- and second-placed teams play against each other. The winner qualifies directly for the final.
In Game 3, the winner of Game 1 plays against the loser of Game 2. The loser is eliminated.
Game 4 (the final) is then played between the winners of Games 2 and 3.
This system gives the top two teams a double chance, in that that they can lose their first game and still go on to win the title, producing a similar though not identical effect to a double-elimination tournament . This gives the top two teams a significant advantage over the next two, since winning the title from third or fourth place requires winning one more game than winning from first or second, and also requires defeating every other team in the playoffs. For example, in 12 years at The Brier , 12 years at the Tournament of Hearts and one year at the Worlds , only thrice, at the 2000 , 2008 and 2009 Tournament of Hearts has the third- or fourth-placed team won the tournament. [8] Additionally, the higher ranked team in any pairing (which, in the final, is automatically the team which won Game 2) will play as the home team to provide an additional advantage; in the case of curling teams, there teams rarely play national or international tournaments at their home rink, the advantage is that the first-placed team is given the hammer (last rock) in the first end, which is a reasonable advantage between comparably skilled teams.
In the 2008 World Women's Curling championship, a fifth match was added to the format: a bronze medal playoff match, which was played between the two teams which did not qualify for the final. Previously, the bronze would have automatically been awarded to the team which lost Game 3. This was also introduced at the national level at the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts and the 2011 Tim Hortons Brier .
Names of matches[ edit ]
In Australia, Games 1 and 2 are known as Semi-Finals; Game 3 is called the Preliminary Final, and the final is known as the Grand Final. To distinguish between the two Semi-Finals, which are different in nature, the match between 3rd and 4th is known either as the First Semi-Final or the Minor Semi-Final; and the match between 1st and 2nd is known either as the Second Semi-Final or the Major Semi-Final.
In Canada, Games 1 and 2 are usually known as the Page Playoffs; Game 3 is called the Semi-Final, and the final is known by that name. However, some sources, in order to distinguish between Games 1 and 2, refer only to Game 2 as a Page Playoff while referring to Game 1 as the Quarter-Final.

Text is av as the Colonial head of the Windward Islands . After the Government of Barbados officially exited from the Windward Island union in 1885, the seat was moved from Bridgetown to St. George's on the neighbouring island of Grenada .
The Coat of Arms of Bridgetown
In December 1925, a committee sought to petition the King for a Royal Charter of Incorporation to devise local government in the city. The plan stated the desire for Bridgetown to be run by a mayor, 8 aldermen, 12 common councillors, a town clerk, a head-borough or chief constable, and such other officers as would be deemed necessary. It was proposed that the island's House of Assembly should seek to Incorporate the city instead of utilising Royal Charter .
It was not until 1958 when the Local Government Act was passed in Barbados. Within the act, called for separate administration for the city. The act called for a mayor, 6 city aldermen, and 12 city councillors — of which four serve each of the three wards in the city.
On 20 September 1960, a grant of arms was conferred upon the city by the Royal College of Arms in London. The armorial bearings for the City of Bridgetown were designed by the late Neville Connell, the then director of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society along with H.W. Ince the Honorary Secretary of the Society.
Local government in Barbados was established but not for long. In April 1967, the system of Local Government Councils was dissolved and replaced by an Interim Commissioner for Local Government. The Corporation of Bridgetown thus ceased to exist, and its records and paraphernalia were deposited in both the Government Department of Archives and Barbados Museum and Historical Society. [14] Today, Bridgetown and surrounding constituencies are administered by members of Barbadian parliament.

Geography[ edit ]
Aerial view of Bridgetown
The city of Bridgetown, and the wider Greater Bridgetown area occupy most of the parish of Saint Michael, an area which covers around 39 km² (15 sq. mi). Bridgetown's centre was originally composed of a swamp , which was quickly drained and filled-in to make way for the city's early development.
At the heart of Bridgetown is the Careenage and Constitution River . This body of water provides the city with direct access from medium-sized yachts or small craft boats. Although moderately shallow, the Careenage slices Bridgetown into two parts. During the rainy season the Constitution River flows into the Careenage area and acts as an outflow for water from the islands interior storm drainage network. Flowing into the Carlisle Bay on the southwest coast of the island, the Careenage can be observed as a marina for boaters entering or exiting the inner basin located directly in front of the Parliament buildings of Barbados.
Climate[ edit ]
Bridgetown features a tropical wet and dry climate , with relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. While fairly hot, Bridgetown is cooled somewhat by the trade winds that affect weather in Barbados in general. Bridgetown’s record high of 35 °C (95.0 °F) and record low of 16 °C (60.8 °F). Bridgetown features distinct wet and dry seasons, with a relatively lengthy wet season and a shorter dry season. Its wet season is from June through January, while the dry season covers the remaining months.

History[ edit ]
Named after the district in south Belfast in which it is located, Windsor Park was first opened in 1905, with a match between Linfield and Glentoran . Most of the current stadium was designed and built in the 1930s, to a design made by the Scottish architect Archibald Leitch . It had one main seated stand - the Grandstand, now known as the South Stand - with "reserved" terracing in front, and a large open terrace behind the goal to the west called the Spion Kop . To the north, there was a long covered terrace - the "unreserved" terracing - and behind the eastern goal at the Railway End another covered terrace. Windsor Park's peak capacity in this format was 60,000. In the early 1960s, the seated Railway Stand was built at the Railway End, and in the early 1970s a social club and viewing lounge was constructed in the corner between the Railway Stand and the Grandstand. In the 1980s, the 'unreserved terrace' was demolished and replaced by a two-tier, 7000-seat North Stand. In the late 1990s, the Kop terrace was demolished and replaced with the 5000-seater Kop Stand. The Kop Stand was known as the Alex Russell Stand from 2004-2008 in honour of Linfield's former goalkeeper and coach and one-time Northern Ireland international, but reverted to being named 'The Kop Stand' following this. [2]
Redevelopment[ edit ]
Owing to the increasingly poor condition of Windsor Park, [3] [4] various proposals for its replacement were mooted, including the idea of a multi-purpose stadium hosting football, rugby union and Gaelic games on the site of the former Maze prison , or a national stadium built as part of a major leisure development at Sydenham in east Belfast. [5] The plans for the multi-purpose stadium at the Maze site was strongly protested by essentially all the Northern Ireland match-going supporters. Various petitions in opposition to the suggestion, as well as organised displays of opposition at matches and the presentation counter-proposals, were arranged by Supporters Clubs in a bid to block any move to the Maze.
In September 2009, the Irish Football Association (IFA) announced that its preferred option was to remain at a redeveloped Windsor Park. [6] In 2011, the Northern Ireland Executive allocated £138m for a major programme of stadium redevelopment throughout Northern Ireland, with £28m allocated to the redevelopment of Windsor Park into a 20,000-capacity all-seater stadium. [7]
In 2012, details of the stadium's redevelopment were released. The plan would see Windsor Park become an 18,000 all-seater stadium with a series of phased works originally intended to begin in the summer of 2013. Plans included the demolition of both the Railway and South Stand structures to be replaced by new stands that would partially enclose the stadium, the complete renovation of the existing North and West Stands, and construction of both new conferencing facilities and a new headquarters facility for the IFA . [8] [9]
In February 2013, planning permission for the redevelopment was granted, with the estimated cost of the project around £29.2 million, of which £25.2 million would come from government funding. It was planned for the work to begin in September 2013. [10] Two months later however, an application for leave for judicial review of the government funding was lodged by Crusaders , who claimed that it was against European Union competition laws and also a form of state aid to Linfield. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders' request was granted, after the judge ruled that they had presented an arguable case that the redevelopment could be classified as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however, was thrown out. [11]
In July 2013, Crusaders agreed to a possible settlement brought forward by the judicial review. The details of the settlement were not forthcoming, but Crusaders said that it had the "potential to benefit the entirety of the football family". [12] In September 2013, sports minister Carál Ní Chuilín said that she was still committed to making sure the redevelopment went ahead as scheduled, after previously stating that she would not sign off on the funding until the IFA sorted out the "governance issues" surrounding David Martin's return to the role of deputy president. [13] In December 2013, three months after the work was originally scheduled to begin, the redevelopment was finally given the green light, with the sports minister signing off on £31 million of funding to complete the project. In May 2014, work finally got under way on the stadium redevelopment. [14] The project is due to be completed by November 2015. [1]
In March 2015, following a Euro 2016 qualifying game against Finland , large cracks were found in the West Stand; this part of the stadium was scheduled for renovation rather than replacement as part of the redevelopment project. As a consequence, the area around the stand had to be sealed off, and led to the 2015 Irish Cup Final being moved to The Oval . The preliminary structural report delivered to the IFA recommended that the damaged stand be demolished. [15] Having accepted this report, the IFA confirmed that the West Stand would be demolished in time to ensure the safety of the stadium for Northern Ireland's qualifier against Romania on 10 June, as well as stating that work on the redevelopment project would be accelerated so that the stadium could meet its 10,000 planned capacity for the game.

Eric Simons , the India bowling coach, is pleased with the resurgence in Ishant Sharma 's bowling in the ongoing West Indies tour, leading up to his maiden ten-wicket match haul in the Barbados Test. Ishant's revival - after a poor tour of South Africa - began in the IPL and has continued in the Caribbean, a transformation Simons attributed to vital technical changes in the bowler's action, including his body and wrist position.
"Ishant had already started taking big strides in South Africa," Simons told the Hindustan Times. "From a technical perspective, what I saw of him in the IPL gave me a lot of confidence.
"Sometimes pressure forces players to try and change too many things technically. And in trying to do that, he lost some of his shape as a bowler. To identify what is wrong is only 10% of the problem; fixing it takes time. That is why the improvement through South Africa, and in the IPL and even more so here.
"His body position forced his grip to change. Now he's more upright, and his wrist is in a better position. Only when you are confident about the technique and start bowling at the pace you are capable of, you can be at your best."
In the absence of Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth, India came into the series with a depleted seam attack and Munaf Patel 's injury following the ODIs made matters worse. Simons said Munaf - whose suspect fitness levels have restricted him to the shorter versions in recent times - has a lot to offer at the Test level.
"I am disappointed about Munaf's injury here," Simons said. "We have been woailable under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License ; additional terms may apply.

Kochi was the centre of Indian spice trade for many centuries, and was known to the Yavanas ( Greeks and Romans ) as well as Jews, Syrians, Arabs, and Chinese since ancient times . [24] Kochi rose to significance as a trading centre after the port Muziris around Kodungallur (Cranganore) was destroyed by massive flooding of Periyar in 1341. [25] The earliest documented references to Kochi occur in books written by Chinese voyager Ma Huan during his visit to Kochi in the 15th century as part of Admiral Zheng He 's treasure fleet. [26] There are also references to Kochi in accounts written by Italian traveller Niccolò Da Conti , who visited Kochi in 1440. [27]
According to many historians, the precursor state to Kingdom of Kochi came into existence in early 12th century, after the fall of the Chera Kingdom . [23] The reign of the Kingdom was hereditary, and the family that ruled over the region was known as the Perumpadappu rulers in the local vernacular. The mainland Kochi remained the capital of the princely state since the 18th century. The King of Kochi only had authority over the region encompassing the present city of Kochi and adjoining areas. However, during much of this time, the kingdom was under foreign suzerainty , and the King often only had titular privileges.
Portuguese navigator, Pedro Álvares Cabral founded the first European settlement in India at Kochi in 1500. [28] [29] From 1503 to 1663, Fort Kochi ( Fort Emmanuel ) was ruled by Portugal . This Portuguese period was a harrowing time for the Saint Thomas Christians and the Jews , as the Inquisition was active in Portuguese India . Kochi hosted the grave of Vasco da Gama , the first European explorer to set sail for India, who was buried at St. Francis Church until his remains were returned to Portugal in 1539. [30] The Portuguese rule was followed by that of the Dutch, who had allied with the Zamorin of Calicut to conquer Kochi. By 1773, the Mysore ruler Hyder Ali extended his conquest in the Malabar region to Kochi forcing it to become a tributary of Mysore . The hereditary Prime Ministership of Kochi held by the Paliath Achans ended during this period.
Kochi City around 1635
Meanwhile, the Dutch, fearing an outbreak of war on the United Provinces , signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 with the United Kingdom, under which Kochi was ceded to the United Kingdom in exchange for the island of Bangka . However, there are evidences of English habitation in the region even before the signing of the treaty. [31] In 1866, Fort Kochi became a municipality, and its first Municipal Council eating contest was conducted in 1883. The Maharaja of Cochin, in 1896 initiated local administration by forming town councils in Mattancherry and Ernakulam . In 1907, the Governor of the Madras Presidency, Sir Arthur Lawley and his brother, Beilby Lawley, 3rd Baron Wenlock , Governor of Madras, 1891 to 1896, left for an official tour of Cochin and Travancore , which lasted from 25 January to 14 February. On 26 January, they were met by His Highness the Rajah of Cochin who gave a State Dinner in their honour at Ernakulam . [32] [33] [34] [35]
In 1925, Kochi legislative assembly was constituted due to public pressure on the state.
St. Francis CSI Church built in 1503, is the oldest European church in India. [36]
Towards the early 20th century, trade at the port had increased substantially, and the need to develop the port was greatly felt. Harbour engineer Robert Bristow was brought to Kochi in 1920 under the direction of Lord Willingdon , then the Governor of Madras . In a span of 21 years, he transformed Kochi as one of the safest harbours in the peninsula, where ships berthed alongside the newly reclaimed inner harbour equipped with a long array of steam cranes. [37]
In 1947, when India gained independence from the British colonial rule , Cochin was the first princely state to join the Indian Union willingly. [23] In 1949, Travancore-Cochin state came into being with the merger of Cochin and Travancore . The King of Travancore was the Rajpramukh of the Travancore-Cochin Union from 1949 to 1956. Travancore-Cochin, was in turn merged with the Malabar district of the Madras State . Finally, the Government of India 's States Reorganisation Act (1956) inaugurated a new state — Kerala — incorporating Travancore-Cochin (excluding the four southern Taluks which were merged with Tamil Nadu ), Malabar District, and the taluk of Kasargod , South Kanara . [38] On 9 July 1960 the Mattancherry council passed a resolution—which was forwarded to the government—requesting the formation of a municipal corporation by combining the existing municipalities of Fort Kochi , Mattancherry, and Ernakulam . The government appointed a commission to study the feasibility of the suggested merger. Based on its report, the Kerala Legislative Assembly approved the corporation's formation. On 1 November 1967, exactly eleven years since the establishment of the state of Kerala, the corporation of Cochin came into existence. The merger leading to the establishment of the corporation, was between the municipalities of Ernakulam, Mattancherry and Fort Kochi , along with that of the Willingdon Island , four panchayats ( Palluruthy , Vennala , Vyttila and Edappally ), and the small islands of Gundu and Ramanthuruth . Kochi and Ernakulam district formed on 1 April 1958 carving areas of erstwhile Travancore-Kochi-Malabar kingdoms. Major portion of the district is from the Kochi kingdom. [6]
The city's economic growth gathered momentum after economic reforms in India introduced by the central government in the early-1990s. Since 2000, the service sector has energized the city's economy. The establishment of several industrial parks based on IT and other port based infrastructure triggered a construction and realty boom in the city. Over the years, Kochi has witnessed rapid commercialisation, and has today grown into the commercial hub of Kerala. [39]
Geography and climate[ edit ]
Main article: Geography of Kochi
A view of Thevara from Kundannur bridge
Kochi is located on the southwest coast of India at 9°58′N 76°13′E﻿ / ﻿9.967°N 76.217°E﻿ / 9.967; 76.217 , spanning an area of 94.88 square kilometers (36.63 square miles). The city straddles the backwaters, encompassing the northern end of a peninsula, several islands and a portion of the mainland. To the west lies the Laccadive Sea , and to the east is the urbanized region in the rest of the mainland area. Much of Kochi lies at sea level, with a coastline of 48 km. [23]
The current metropolitan limits of Kochi include the mainland Ernakulam , Fort Kochi , the suburbs of Edapally , Kalamassery and Kakkanad to the northeast; Tripunithura to the southeast; and a group of islands closely scattered in the Vembanad Lake . Most of these islands are very small, varying in area from 6 km2 to less than 1 km2 (1,500 to less than 250 acres).[ citation needed ] The state government and the GCDA have plans to include Mala and Kodungallur in Thrissur district, Angamaly , Perumbavoor , Piravom and Kolenchery in Ernakulam district, Thalayolaparambu and Vaikom in Kottayam and Cherthala in Alappuzha district within Kochi metropolitan limits. The newly formed metropolis would be put under the charge of a new authority called Kochi Metropolitan Regional Development Authority. [40] [41] However, The Hindu reported that the state government is yet to take any concrete steps in this regard. [42]
Soil consists of sediments such as alluvium , teri's, brown sands, etc. Hydromorphic saline soils are also found in the areas surrounding the backwaters. [23]
Predominant rock types found here are Archaean -basic dykes , Charnockites and Gneisses . An ecologically sensitive area, the Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary is located in the central part of the city. It has a wide range of mangrove species and is a nesting ground for a vast variety of migratory birds.
Kochi's water needs are entirely dependent on ground water and the two rivers flowing through the district viz., Periyar and Muvattupuzha . Periyar serves the entire northern part of the city whereas Muvattupuzha river under the JnNurm project covers the West Kochi, East Kochi and parts of Cherthala taluk under the Japan Water Project Scheme.
Climate[ edit ]
Under the Köppen climate classification , Kochi features a tropical monsoon climate (Am). Kochi's proximity to the equator along with its coastal location results in little seasonal temperature variation, with moderate to high levels of humidity. Annual temperatures range between 23 and 31 °C (73 and 88 °F) with the record high being 36.5 °C (97.7 °F), and record low 16.3 °C (61.3 °F). [43] From June to September, the south-west monsoon brings in heavy rains as Kochi lies on the windward side of the Western Ghats . From October to December, Kochi receives lighter (yet significant) rain from the northeast monsoon, as it lies on the leeward side. Average annual rainfall is 2,978.0 mm (117.24 in), with an annual average of 125 rainy days. [44]

Trinidad[ edit ]
Pigeon Point in Tobago , one of the top tourist destinations in the country.
Both Trinidad and Tobago were originally settled by Amerindians of South American origin. Trinidad was first settled by pre-agricultural Archaic people at least 7,000 years ago, making it the earliest-settled part of the Caribbean. Ceramic-using agriculturalists settled Trinidad around 250 BC, and then moved further up the Lesser Antillean chain . At the time of European contact, Trinidad was occupied by various Arawakan -speaking groups including the Nepoya and Suppoya, and Cariban -speaking groups such as the Yao, while Tobago was occupied by the Island Caribs and Galibi .
Parlatuvier Bay, a popular tourist destination in Tobago .
The Chaconia ( Warszewiczia coccinea ) is the national flower of Trinidad and Tobago.
Christopher Columbus encountered the island of Trinidad on 31 July 1498. Antonio de Sedeño, a Spanish soldier intent on conquering the island of Trinidad, landed on its southwest coast with a small army of men in the 1530s as a means of controlling the Orinoco and subduing the Warao. Sedeño and his men fought the native Carib Indians on many occasions, and subsequently built a fort. Cacique Wannawanare (Guanaguanare) granted the St Joseph area to Domingo de Vera e Ibargüen in 1592, and then withdrew to another part of the island. [14] San José de Oruña (St Joseph) was established by Antonio de Berrío on this land. Sir Walter Raleigh , searching for the long-rumored "City of Gold" in South America, arrived in Trinidad on 22 March 1595 and soon attacked San José and captured and interrogated de Berrío, obtaining much information from him and from the cacique Topiawari.
The Arena Massacre or Arena Uprising took place on 1 December 1699 in Trinidad. It resulted in the death of several hundred Amerindians, Roman Catholic priests connected with the mission of San Francisco de los Arenales and the Spanish Governor José de León y Echales and all but one member of his party.
Amerindians tied to the Church's encomienda at the mission at Arena revolted, killing the priests and desecrating the church. They then ambushed the governor and his party, who were on their way to visit the church. Among those killed in the governor's party was Fr. Juan Mazien de Sotomayor, O.P., missionary priest to the Nepuyo villages of Cuara, Tacarigua and Arauca.
In the 1700s, Trinidad belonged as an island province to the Viceroyalty of New Spain together with Central America, present-day Mexico and Southwestern United States. [28] However, Trinidad in this period was still mostly forest, populated by a few Spaniards with their handful of slaves and a few thousand Amerindians. [28] Spanish colonisation in Trinidad remained tenuous. Because Trinidad was considered underpopulated, Roume de St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in Grenada, was able to obtain a Cédula de Población from the Spanish king Charles III on 4 November 1783.
This Cédula de Población was more generous than the first of 1776, and granted free lands to Roman Catholic foreign settlers and their slaves in Trinidad willing to swear allegiance to the Spanish king. [29] The land grant was 30 fanegas (13 hectares/32 acres) for each free man, woman and child and half of that for each slave brought. As a result, Scots, Irish, German, Italian and English families arrived. Protestants benefited from Governor Don José María Chacon 's generous interpretation of the law.[ citation needed ]
During the French Revolution, French planters with their slaves, free coloureds and mulattos from neighbouring islands of Martinique, Saint Lucia , Grenada , Guadeloupe and Dominica migrated to Trinidad, where they established an agriculture-based economy (sugar and cocoa). [28] These new immigrants established local communities in Blanchisseuse , Champs Fleurs, Paramin , [30] Cascade, Carenage and Laventille . Trinidad's population jumped to over 15,000 by the end of 1789, from just under 1,400 in 1777.
By 1797 the population of Port of Spain had increased from under 3,000 to 10,422 in five years, and consisted of people of mixed race, Spaniards, Africans, French republican soldiers, retired pirates and French nobility. [28] The total population of Trinidad was 17,718, of which 2,151 were of European ancestry, 4,476 were "free blacks and people of colour", 10,009 were slaves and 1,082 Amerindians .
In 1797, General Sir Ralph Abercromby and his squadron sailed through the Bocas and anchored off the coast of Chaguaramas during the invasion of Trinidad . The Spanish Governor Chacón decided to capitulate without fighting. Trinidad thus became a British crown colony, with a French-speaking population and Spanish laws. [28] The conquest and formal ceding of Trinidad in 1802 led to an influx of settlers from England and the British colonies of the Eastern Caribbean. The sparse settlement and slow rate of population increase during Spanish rule and even after British rule made Trinidad one of the less-populated colonies of the West Indies with the least developed plantation infrastructure. [31] Under British rule, new estates were created and slave importation increased to facilitate development of the land into highly profitable sugarcane estates, but mass importation of slaves was still limited and hindered, arguably by abolitionist efforts in Britain. [31] [32]
The Abolitionist movement [31] and the decreased economic viability of slavery as a means of procuring labour [32] both resulted in the abolition of slavery in 1833 via the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (citation 3 & 4 Will. IV c. 73), which was followed by the substitution of an " apprenticeship " period. This was also abolished in 1838, with full emancipation being granted on 1 August. An overview of the populations statistics in 1838, however, clearly reveals the contrast between Trinidad and its neighbouring islands: upon emancipation of the slaves in 1838, Trinidad had only 17,439 slaves, with 80% of slave owners having less than 10 slaves each. [32] :84–85
In contrast, at twice the size of Trinidad, Jamaica had roughly 360,000 slaves. [33] Upon emancipation, therefore, the plantation owners were in severe need of labour, and the British filled this need by instituting a system of indentureship . Various nationalities were contracted under this system, including Chinese, Portuguese and Indians. Of these, the Indians were imported in the largest numbers, starting from 1 May 1845, when 225 Indians were brought in the first shipment to Trinidad on the Fatel Rozack, a Muslim-owned vessel [34] Indentureship of the Indians lasted from 1845 to 1917, during which more than 147,000 Indians were brought to Trinidad to work on sugarcane plantations. [35]
They added what was initially the second-largest population grouping to the young nation, and their labour developed previously underdeveloped plantation lands. The indentureship contract was exploitative, such that historians including Hugh Tinker were to call it "a new system of slavery". People were contracted for a period of five years with a daily wage (25 cents in the early twentieth century), after which they were guaranteed return passage to India. Coercive means were often used to obtain labourers, however, and the indentureship contracts were soon extended to 10 years after the planters complained they were losing their labour too early. [31]
In lieu of the return passage, the British authorities soon began offering portions of land to encourage settlement; however, the numbers of people who did receive land grants is unclear. [36] Indians entering the colony were also subject to particular crown laws which segregated them from the rest of Trinidad's population, such as the requirement that they carry a pass with them once off the plantations, and that if freed, they carry their "Free Papers" or certificate indicating completion of the indenture period. [37] The ex-Indentureds came to constitute a vital and significant section of the population, as did the ex-slaves.
The cacao ( cocoa ) crop also contributed greatly to the economic earnings in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. After the collapse of the cacao crop (due to disease and the Great Depression ), petroleum increasingly came to dominate the economy. Petroleum was discovered in 1857. [38] The collapse of the sugarcane industry concomitant with the failure of the cocoa industry resulted in widespread depression among the rural and agricultural workers in Trinidad, and encouraged the rise of the Labour movement in the 1920–1930 period. This was led by Tubal Uriah "Buzz" Butler , who, in combination with his Indian partners (notably Adrian Cola Rienzi ), aimed to unite the working class and agricultural labour class to achieve a better standard of living for all, as well as to hasten the departure of the British. This effort was severely undermined by the British Home Office and by the British-educated Trinidadian elite, many of whom were descended from the plantocracy themselves. They instigated a vicious race politicking in Trinidad aimed at dividing the class-based movement on race-based lines, and they succeeded, especially since Butler's support had collapsed from the top down. The Depression and the rise of the oil economy led to changes in the social structure. By the 1950s, petroleum had become a staple in Trinidad's export market, and was responsible for a growing middle class among all sections of the Trinidad population.
A view from Pigeon Point, Tobago over to Nomansland.
Columbus reported seeing Tobago on the distant horizon in 1498, naming it Bellaforma, but did not land on the island. [39] The present name of Tobago is thought to be a corruption of its old name, "Tobaco". [15]
The Dutch and the Courlanders (people from the small duchy of Courland and Semigallia in modern-day Latvia ) established themselves in Tobago in the 16th and 17th centuries and produced tobacco and cotton. Over the centuries, Tobago changed hands between Spanish , British , French , Dutch and Courlander colonizers. Britain consolidated its hold on both islands during the Napoleonic Wars , and they were combined into the colony of Trinidad and Tobago in 1889. [38]
As a result of these colonial struggles, Amerindian, Spanish, French and English place names are all common in the country. African slaves and Chinese, Indian, Tamil and free African indentured labourers , as well as Portuguese from Madeira, arrived to supply labour in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Emigration from Barbados and the other Lesser Antilles, Venezuela , Syria and Lebanon also impacted on the ethnic make-up of the country. Tobago is approximately 25 minutes fly time from Piarco International Airport, Trinidad and by boat approximately 3 hours 30 minutes.
Independence[ edit ]
Trinidad and Tobago gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 31 August 1962. [38] Elizabeth II remained head of state as Queen of Trinidad and Tobago . Eric Williams , a noted Caribbean historian, widely regarded as "The Father of The Nation," was the first Prime Minister; he served from 1956, before independence, until his death in 1981.
The presence of American military bases in Chaguaramas and Cumuto in Trinidad during World War II profoundly changed the character of society. In the post-war period, the wave of decolonisation that swept the British Empire led to the formation of the West Indies Federation in 1958 as a vehicle for independence. Chaguaramas was the proposed site for the federal capital. The Federation dissolved after the withdrawal of Jamaica , and the government chose to seek independence on its own.[ citation needed ]
In 1976, the country became a republic within the Commonwealth , though it retained the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as its final Court of Appeal. Between the years 1972 and 1983, the republic profited greatly from the rising price of oil , as the oil-rich country increased its living standards greatly. In 1990, 114 members of the Jamaat al Muslimeen , led by Yasin Abu Bakr , formerly known as Lennox Phillip, stormed the Red House (the seat of Parliament ), and Trinidad and Tobago Television , the only television station in the country at the time, and held the country's government hostage for six days before surrendering.[ citation needed ]
Since 2003, the country has entered a second oil boom, a driving force which the government hopes to use to turn the country's main export back to sugar and agriculture .[ citation needed ] Great concern was raised in August 2007 when it was predicted that this boom would last only until 2018. Petroleum, petrochemicals and natural gas continue to be the backbone of the economy. Tourism and the public service are the mainstay of the economy of Tobago, though authorities have begun to diversify the island. [40] The bulk of tourist arrivals on the islands are from Western Europe.[ citation needed ]
The country is also a recognised transhipment point for illegal narcotics, with the cocaine distribution from the South American continent to the United States Eastern seaboard. With the most recent seizure of $100 million US dollar shipment by United States Authorities on 17 January 2014 [41]
Main article: Politics of Trinidad and Tobago
The Red House : Trinidad and Tobago's Parliament Buildings 2008 (undergoing renovations).
Trinidad and Tobago is a republic with a two-party system and a bicameral parliamentary system based on the Westminster System . The head of state of Trinidad and Tobago is the President , currently Anthony Carmona . The head of government is the Prime Minister , currently Keith Rowley . The President is elected by an Electoral college consisting of the full membership of both houses of Parliament .
The Prime Minister is elected from the results of a general election which takes place every five years. The President is required to appoint the leader of the party who in his opinion has the most support of the members of the House of Representatives to this post; this has generally been the leader of the party which won the most seats in the previous election (except in the case of the 2001 General Elections ). Tobago also has its own elections, separate from the general elections. In these elections, members are elected and serve in the Tobago House of Assembly.
Parliament consists of the Senate (31 seats) and the House of Representatives (41 seats). [42] The members of the Senate are appointed by the president. Sixteen Government Senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, six Opposition Senators are appointed on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition and nine Independent Senators are appointed by the President to represent other sectors of civil society. The 41 members of the House of Representatives are elected by the people for a maximum term of five years in a " first past the post " system.
Political culture[ edit ]
The President's House Trinidad.
From 24 December 2001 to 24 May 2010, the governing party has been the People's National Movement (PNM) led by Patrick Manning ; the Opposition pal with the bowling crease and hips. Malcolm Marshall is an example of a chest on bowler.
Mid-way: the back foot is in between the side on and chest on position. A fine example of a mid-way bowler is Allan Donald .
If the bowler's back foot is behind parallel to the bowling crease, the bowler loses momentum and speed when delivering the ball. This is because the bowler's back foot bends at the knee and causes momentum to be lost and the bowler then has to go back and lift their whole body back upright.
An action that fails to align hips and shoulders at back foot contact is termed a mixed action.
Other coaching points
The body should be upright or just slightly leaning back. Leaning back too far causes momentum to be lost as it takes too long to transfer from back foot contact to front foot contact .
Head still and looking at the target.
Ball held close to the chin. This tucked in position allows the ball to be brought through in an arc that is aligned with the target. This is obviously important for accuracy, but is also important for power.
The non bowling arm should also be inside or close to the line of the trunk. Traditionally the non bowling arm is held vertically. More recent bio-mechanical theories have suggested that the non bowling hand touching the bowling shoulder provides a shorter lever, permitting greater pace for quick bowlers. Shoaib Akhtar uses this technique.
Front foot contact[ edit ]
Front foot contact is the position of the bowler at the moment when the front foot hits the ground just prior to delivering the ball. For a right-handed bowler the front foot is normally the left foot.
Point of release[ edit ]
The point of release is the position of the ball in relation to the body at the moment when the ball is released. It is crucial for the arm to be stiff, not bent, [2] and the wrist rather looser, to ensure smooth release of the ball, and sufficient bounce off the pitch. Otherwise, the action will resemble chucking . The left shoulder ought to be somewhat towards the stumps, the arm beside the bowler falling away, having just before this stage been pointing directly at the stumps.
For fast bowlers at the point of release the back of hand will be facing in the opposite direction of the batsmen facing the pending delivery. The front of the upright wrist and tips of the index and middle fingers all point to the target. For spin bowlers the wrist may well be at various angles at release point. This is because one is trying to create drag on a particular side of the ball, not propel it straight as per the section above.

Security concerns and controversy before the tour[ edit ]
Before the Australian cricket team was scheduled to tour India and play a series of Test matches, one-day internationals and Twenty20 matches, it was doubtful if the Australian cricket team would tour India after the terror attacks in Delhi and the press briefing given by India's National Security Advisor M. K. Narayan that raised issues of security concern in the minds of Australia's cricketers.
On 13 September 2008, serial bomb blasts took place in India's capital city Delhi in which 30 people died and over 100 people were injured. [8] The very next day after the blasts, Cricket Australia (CA) issued a statement saying that it will review the security situation in the wake of the blasts and will make its decision the next week after performing a risk assessment . [9] The Board of Control for Cricket in India , however, asserted that the blast would have no bearing on the cricket tour which would go ahead as scheduled. [10] However, a conflicting report made on 15 September claimed that Cricket Australia had briefed that the tour was on track. [11] Following these reports, the Pakistan Cricket Board lashed at the Australian cricket establishment for agreeing to tour India while postponing their tour to Pakistan in early 2008 and accused the board of adopting double standards. [12] One PCB official even called the Australians "lilly-livered cowards" [13] But Ricky Ponting issued a statement vindicating Cricket Australia's stand by saying that the circumstances accompanying the cancellation of Australia's tour of Pakistan were entirely different. [14] However, on 17 September 2008, Australia skipper Ricky Ponting said that the tour was not yet confirmed [15] and that it could go either way. [16]

Sri Vikrama Rajasinha of Kandy , the last monarch of the Sinhalese monarchy
During the Napoleonic Wars , fearing that French control of the Netherlands might deliver Sri Lanka to the French, Great Britain occupied the coastal areas of the island (which they called Ceylon) with little difficulty in 1796. [89] Two years later, in 1798, Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha , third of the four Nayakkar kings of Sri Lanka, died of a fever. Following his death, a nephew of Rajadhi Rajasinha, eighteen-year-old Kannasamy, was crowned. [90] The young king, now named Sri Vikrama Rajasinha , faced a British invasion in 1803 but successfully retaliated. By then, the entire coastal area was under the British East India Company as a result of the Treaty of Amiens . But on 14 February 1815, Kandy was occupied by the British in the second Kandyan War , finally ending Sri Lanka's independence. [90] Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last native monarch of Sri Lanka, was exiled to India. [91] The Kandyan Convention formally ceded the entire country to the British Empire. Attempts by Sri Lankan noblemen to undermine British power in 1818 during the Uva Rebellion were thwarted by Governor Robert Brownrigg . [92]
The beginning of the modern period of Sri Lanka is marked by the Colebrooke-Cameron reforms of 1833. [93] They introduced a utilitarian and liberal political culture to the country based on the rule of law and amalgamated the Kandyan and maritime provinces as a single unit of government. [93] An Executive Council and a Legislative Council were established, later becoming the foundation of a representative legislature. By this time, experiments with coffee plantation were largely successful. Soon coffee became the primary commodity export of the country. Falling coffee prices as a result of the depression of 1847 stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of taxes on firearms, dogs, shops, boats, etc., and to reintroduce a form of rajakariya, requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent. [94] These harsh measures antagonised the locals, and another rebellion broke out in 1848. [95] A devastating leaf disease, Hemileia vastatrix , struck the coffee plantations in 1869, destroying the entire industry within fifteen years. [96] The British quickly found a replacement: abandoning coffee, they began cultivating tea instead. Tea production in Sri Lanka thrived in the following decades. Large-scale rubber plantations began in the early 20th century.
British appointed Kandyan chiefs, 1905
By the end of the 19th century, a new educated social class transcending race and caste arose through British attempts to staff the Ceylon Civil Service and the legal, educational, and medical professions. [97] New leaders represented the various ethnic groups of the population in the Ceylon Legislative Council on a communal basis. Buddhist and Hindu revivalism reacted against Christian missionary activities. [98] [99] The first two decades in the 20th century are noted by the unique harmony among Sinhalese and Tamil political leadership, which has since been lost. [100] In 1919, major Sinhalese and Tamil political organisations united to form the Ceylon National Congress, under the leadership of Ponnambalam Arunachalam , [101] pressing colonial masters for more constitutional reforms. But without massive popular support, and with the governor's encouragement for "communal representation" by creating a "Colombo seat" that dangled between Sinhalese and Tamils, the Congress lost momentum towards the mid-1920s. [102] The Donoughmore reforms of 1931 repudiated the communal representation and introduced universal adult franchise (the franchise stood at 4% before the reforms). This step was strongly criticised by the Tamil political leadership, who realised that they would be reduced to a minority in the newly created State Council of Ceylon , which succeeded the legislative council. [103] [104] In 1937, Tamil leader G. G. Ponnambalam demanded a 50–50 representation (50% for the Sinhalese and 50% for other ethnic groups) in the State Council. However, this demand was not met by the Soulbury reforms of 1944–45.

The formal ceremony marking the start of self-rule, with the opening of the first parliament at Independence Square .
The Soulbury constitution ushered in Dominion status , with independence proclaimed on 4 February 1948. [105] D. S. Senanayake became the first Prime Minister of Ceylon . [106] Prominent Tamil leaders like Ponnambalam and Arunachalam Mahadeva joined his cabinet. [103] [107] The British Royal Navy remained stationed at Trincomalee until 1956. A countrywide popular demonstration against withdrawal of the rice ration, known as Hartal 1953 , resulted in the resignation of prime minister Dudley Senanayake . [108] S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was elected prime minister in 1956. His three-year rule had a profound impact through his self-proclaimed role of "defender of the besieged Sinhalese culture". [109] He introduced the controversial Sinhala Only Act , recognising Sinhala as the only official language of the government. Although partially reversed in 1958, the bill posed a grave concern for the Tamil community, which perceived in it a threat to their language and culture. [110] [111] [112] The Federal Party (FP) launched a movement of non-violent resistance ( satyagraha ) against the bill, which prompted Bandaranaike to reach an agreement ( Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact ) with S. J. V. Chelvanayakam , leader of the FP, to resolve the looming ethnic conflict. [113] However, the pact proved ineffective in the face of ongoing protests by opposition and the Buddhist clergy. The bill, together with various government colonisation schemes , contributed much towards the political rancour between Sinhalese and Tamil political leaders. [114] Bandaranaike was assassinated by an extremist Buddhist monk in 1959. [115]
Sirimavo Bandaranaike , the widow of Bandaranaike, took office as prime minister in 1960, and withstood an attempted coup d'état in 1962. During her second term as prime minister, the government instituted socialist economic polices, strengthening ties with the Soviet Union and China , while promoting a policy of non-alignment. In 1971, Ceylon experienced a Marxist insurrection , which was quickly suppressed. In 1972, the country became a republic named Sri Lanka, repudiating its dominion status. Prolonged minority grievances and the use of communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders abetted a fledgling Tamil militancy in the north during the 1970s. [116] The policy of standardisation by the Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrolment, which was in essence an affirmative action to assist geographically disadvantaged students to obtain tertiary education, [117] resulted in reducing the proportion of Tamil students at university level and acted as the immediate catalyst for the rise of militancy. [118] [119] The assassination of Jaffna Mayor Alfred Duraiyappah in 1975 by LTTE marked a crisis point. [120] [121]

The Government of J. R. Jayawardene swept to power in 1977, defeating the largely unpopular United Front government. [123] Jayawardene introduced a new constitution , together with a free-market economy and a powerful executive presidency modelled after that of France. It made Sri Lanka the first South Asian country to liberalise its economy. [124] Beginning in 1983, ethnic tensions were manifested in an on-and-off insurgency against the government by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). An LTTE attack on 13 soldiers resulted in the anti-Tamil race riots in July 1983 allegedly backed by Sinhalese hard-line ministers, which resulted in more than 150,000 Tamil civilians fleeing the island, seeking asylum in other countries. [122] [125] Lapses in foreign policy resulted in India strengthening the Tigers by providing arms and training. [126] [127] [128] In 1987, the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord was signed and the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was deployed in northern Sri Lanka to stabilise the region by neutralising the LTTE. [129] The same year, the JVP launched its second insurrection in Southern Sri Lanka, [130] necessitating redeployment of the IPKF in 1990. [131] In 1990 October, the LTTE expelled Sri Lankan Moors (Muslims by religion) from northern Sri Lanka. [132] In 2002, the Sri Lankan government and LTTE signed a Norwegian-mediated ceasefire agreement. [112]

The 2004 Asian tsunami killed over 35,000 in Sri Lanka. [133] From 1985 to 2006, Sri Lankan government and Tamil insurgents held four rounds of peace talks without success. Both LTTE and the government resumed fighting in 2006, and the government officially backed out of the ceasefire in 2008. [112] In 2009, under the Presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the LTTE, and re-established control of the entire country by the Sri Lankan Government. [134] [135] Overall, between 60,000 and 100,000 people were killed during the 26 years of conflict. [136] [137]
40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed in the final phases of the Sri Lankan civil war , according to an Expert Panel convened by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon . The exact number of Tamils killed is still a speculation that needs further study. [138] Following the LTTE's defeat, the Tamil National Alliance , the largest Tamil political party in Sri Lanka, dropped its demand for a separate state in favour of a federal solution. [139] [140] The final stages of the war left some 294,000 people displaced. [141] [142] According to the Ministry of Resettlement, most of the displaced persons had been released or returned to their places of origin, leaving only 6,651 in the camps as of December 2011. [143] In May 2010, President Rajapaksa appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to assess the conflict between the time of the ceasefire agreement in 2002 and the defeat of the LTTE in 2009. [144] [145] Sri Lanka has emerged from its 26-year war to become one of the fastest growing economies of the world. [146] [147]
Main article: Geography of Sri Lanka
Topographic map of Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka lies on the Indian Plate , a major tectonic plate that was formerly part of the Indo-Australian Plate . [148] It is in the Indian Ocean southwest of the Bay of Bengal , between latitudes 5° and 10°N , and longitudes 79° and 82°E . [149] Sri Lanka is separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Strait . According to Hindu mythology , a land bridge existed between the Indian mainland and Sri Lanka. It now amounts to only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above sea level . [150] Legends claim that it was passable on foot up to 1480 AD, until cyclones deepened the channel. [151] [152]
A view of Sripada from Maskeliya
The island consists mostly of flat to rolling coastal plains, with mountains rising only in the south-central part. The highest point is Pidurutalagala , reaching 2,524 metres (8,281 ft) above sea level. The climate is tropical and warm, due to the moderating effects of ocean winds. Mean temperatures range from 17 °C (62.6 °F) in the central highlands , where frost may occur for several days in the winter, to a maximum of 33 °C (91.4 °F) in other low-altitude areas. Average yearly temperatures range from 28 °C (82.4 °F) to nearly 31 °C (87.8 °F). Day and night temperatures may vary by 14 °C (25.2 °F) to 18 °C (32.4 °F). [153]
View of Sri Lanka from the Space Shuttle
Rainfall pattern is influenced by monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. The "wet zone" and some of the windward slopes of the central highlands receive up to 2,500 millimetres (98.4 in) of rain each month, but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain. Most of the east, southeast, and northern parts of the country comprise the "dry zone", which receives between 1,200 and 1,900 mm (47 and 75 in) of rain annually. [154] The arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least amount of rain at 800 to 1,200 mm (31 to 47 in) per year. Periodic squalls occur and sometimes tropical cyclones bring overcast skies and rains to the southwest, northeast, and eastern parts of the island. Humidity is typically higher in the southwest and mountainous areas and depends on the seasonal patterns of rainfall. [155]
An increase in average rainfall coupled with heavier rainfall events has resulted in recurrent flooding and related damages to infrastructure, utility supply and the urban economy. [156]
The country has 103 rivers. The longest of these is the Mahaweli River , extending 335 kilometres (208 mi). [157] These waterways give rise to 51 natural waterfalls of 10 meters or more. The highest is Bambarakanda Falls , with a height of 263 metres (863 ft). [158] Sri Lanka's coastline is 1,585 km long. [159] It claims an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles , which is approximately 6.7 times the country's land area. The coastline and adjacent waters support highly productive marine ecosystems such as fringing coral reefs and shallow beds of coastal and estuarine seagrasses . [160] Sri Lanka has 45 estuaries and 40 lagoons . [159] The country's mangrove ecosystem, which spans over 7,000 hectares , played a vital role in buffering the force of the waves in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami . [161] The island is rich in minerals such as ilmenite , feldspar , graphite , silica , kaolin , mica and thorium . [162] [163] Existence of petroleum and gas in the Gulf of Mannar has also been confirmed and the extraction of recoverable quantities is underway. [164]
Flora and fauna[ edit ]
Main articles: Environment of Sri Lanka and Wildlife of Sri Lanka
The Sri Lankan elephant is one of three recognised subspecies of the Asian elephant . The 2011 elephant census estimated a population of 5,879. [165]
Lying within the Indomalaya ecozone , Sri Lanka is one of 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world. [166] Although the country is relatively small in size, it has the highest biodiversity density in Asia. [167] A remarkably high proportion of the species among its flora and fauna, 27% of the 3,210 flowering plants and 22% of the mammals (see List ), are endemic . [168] Sri Lanka has declared 24 wildlife reserves, which are home to a wide range of native species such as Asian elephants , leopards , sloth bears , the unique small loris, a variety of deer, the purple-faced langur , the endangered wild boar , porcupines and Indian pangolins . [169]
Flowering acacias flourish on the arid Jaffna Peninsula . Among the trees of the dry-land forests are valuable species such as satinwood , ebony , ironwood , mahogany and teak . The wet zone is a tropical evergreen forest with tall trees, broad foliage, and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers. Subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in the higher altitudes. [170]
