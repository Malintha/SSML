At the age of 18, Sharma was called to join the Indian squad for the tour of South Africa in 2006–07 .
However, after receiving the call and organising travel arrangements, it was decided not to send him on the tour.
While being a "rhythm" bowler, he still is considered one of the fastest Indian bowlers having bowled in excess of 150 km/h on several occasions in international cricket as well as the IPL, his fastest being 152 km/h.
Ishant plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and has taken 68 wickets in 14  first-class games, Ishant toured England with the India Under-19s in 2006 and Pakistan in 2006–07.
He played three youth tests and six youth One Day Internationals for India.
On the basis of his strong performance in Australia in 2008, Ishant Sharma was bought for a winning bid of $950,000 by Kolkata Knight Riders in the player auction for the Indian Premier League .
This was the highest amount paid for any bowler in tournament.
In May 2007, Sharma was selected in the test team for the Bangladesh tour and played as a replacement for the fast bowler Munaf Patel .
Over there he played for his national side in the second test where he bowled three overs including one maiden and conceded only five runs without taking a wicket.
Later on, he was called for the tour of England in July–August 2007.

Sharma got a call back in the team in the 3rd Test during Pakistan's tour of India in December 2007 due to injury of India's frontline pacers Zaheer Khan , RP Singh , and Sreesanth .
This performance earned him a place in India's squad for the tour of Australia.
Sharma was left out in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne during the Border–Gavaskar Trophy as India retained their main fast bowlers, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh.
However, in January 2008 Sharma was called to represent India once again to replace the injured Zaheer Khan in the second test at the SCG .
Sharma started the first day of the match strongly and was involved in a controversial decision from Steve Bucknor when Andrew Symonds nicked the ball to keeper MS Dhoni off his bowling but was given not out.
He bowled reasonably in the match, however without much luck.Although he had little success, the management retained him for the third Test match at Perth.
On the fourth day of the match he bowled an exceptional spell to Australian captain Ricky Ponting that resulted in his wicket and helped India claim victory.
On 10 February 2008, Sharma bagged four important wickets in the 4th ODI of CB Series against Australia.
He ended the match with figures of 4/38 and named Man of the Match.
During the 2008 Test series against Australia in India , Ishant was the leading wicket-taker, with 16, and was named man-of-the-series as India won 2–0.
He thereby became the first Indian paceman to win such an award in a Test series on Indian soil after Kapil Dev who won the award in 1983.

He was noted for achieving reverse swing on balls sometimes as young as eight overs, and along with senior opening bowler Zaheer Khan, troubled the touring Australians.
However, in 2009, Ishant's form slumped, and he was dropped for the second Test against Sri Lanka, replaced by Sreesanth .
On 5 October 2010, Ishant helped VVS Laxman pull off a highly unlikely win over Australia by one wicket in the first Test in Mohali after India had fallen to 8/124 in pursuit of 205.
Ishant provided Laxman with support during an 81-run partnership in which he contributed 31 valuable runs.In the 2011 IPL auction, Sharma was bought by the Deccan Chargers ; he hoped that his performance in the competition would give him a chance to impress selectors and push for selection in India's ODI team.
After the tour of West Indies, India suffer a run of eight consecutive defeats in away Tests.
In July and August the team played four Tests in England .
England inflicted a 4–0 whitewash on India, In March 2012, Sharma underwent surgery on his ankle which had been troubling him for over a year.
The operation meant that he missed the 2012 IPL.
In 2013 Ind vs Aus ODI series, he gave away 30 runs in an over, equalling the most expensive over by an Indian bowler.
After some bad performances against Australia in 2013 ODI series, he came back strongly against South Africa taking 4/40 in the third ODI on 11 December 2013 at SuperSport Park , which was his 2nd best performance in ODIs.
In the 2014 tour of England , Sharma secured his career best figures of 7/74 at the Lord's , with an aggressive spell in England's second innings, bowling India to a 95-run win.

India won the series 2–1.
A right arm fast-medium bowler, the speed of Sharma's bowling has diminished since he emerged on the international scene,  although in 2008 he bowled a delivery at Fox SportsThe Australian Tri-Series refers to the one day international  cricket tournament held in Australia, and contested by Australia and two touring teams.
The series is played during the height of the Australian cricket season, in the summer months of December, January and February.
The series has been the primary format for international one-day cricket throughout most of the history of ODI cricket in Australia.
The tri-series was first held in 1979–80 and was contested every season until 2007–08.
It has since been held twice, in the 2011–12 season,  and again in the 2014–15 season, prior to the World Cup .
The concept of a three-team international series known as a tri-series in cricket originated with the World Series Cricket program sponsored by Kerry Packer .
Packer was keen to exploit what he saw as strong interest in ODI cricket, and staged long tri-series amongst teams from Australia, West Indies, and The Rest of the World in the 1977–78 and 1978–79 seasons.
These tournaments have never been awarded either One Day International or List A status.
When the World Series Cricket schism ended in 1979–80, the tri-series format was retained.

Throughout its existence, the tournament was held as a series of One Day Internationals , featuring a round-robin played amongst the three teams, followed by a finals series played between the top two.
The most common format over the years was that each team played each other four times in the round-robin, followed by a final decided by a best-of-three series , for a total of fourteen or fifteen ODIs played through the summer.
From 1980–81 to 1985–86, and in 1998–99, each team played the others five times during the round robin.
In 1980–81 and 1981–82, the finals series was best of fiveIn 1994–95 only, a quadrangular series featuring two touring sides, Australia and Australia A was played; each team played the others twice during the round robin, followed by a best-of-three finals series.
Matches played against Australia A are considered List A matches, but not ODIs.In 2004–05 only, each team played the others only three times during the round robinOver its duration, the series has taken on several mostly commercial names:New laws limiting tobacco advertising in Australia forced the name to change after 1995–96After the 2007–08 season, the tri-series format was abandoned.
For three seasons , Australia still played ODIs against two touring teams, but these were staged as separate ODI series against a single opponent.
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was still the naming rights sponsor of ODI cricket in Australia during these summers, so all series were still known as the Commonwealth Bank Series during this time.
The tri-series format returned in the 2011–12 season, but according to the ICC Future Tours Programme , this will not herald a permanent return to the format.
A shortened tri-series of only seven matches  was played in the 2014–15 season in the lead-up to the 2015 World Cup in Australia.
All series that Australia is scheduled to host up to the 2019–20 season will be played against a single opponent.

Played mostly during a strong era for Australian cricket, Australia won twenty of the thirty-one tri-series played up to 2014–15.
Australia failed to reach the finals on only three occasions.
West Indies, who featured in the series frequently during the 1980s, was the next most successful team, winning six tournaments.
Other international teams to win the tri-series were England .
Notable moments in the Australian Tri-Series
1979–80 – The match on 27 November 1979 between Australia and West Indies in Sydney was the first official One Day International to be played at night.
Like the tri-series concept itself, night matches were a World Series Cricket initiative that was adopted into ODI cricket.
1979–80 – England defeated West Indies by two runs in Sydney when, West Indies requiring three runs to win from the final ball of the match, England captain Mike Brearley pushed all of his fieldsmen, including the wicket-keeper, back to the boundary.
ODI rules were changed to incorporate fielding restrictions to prevent any repeat of this incident.
Trevor Chappell bowls underarm to Brian McKechnie in the 3rd Final of 1980–81 WSC1980–81 – In the third final, with New Zealand needing six runs from the final ball to tie the match, Australian captain Greg Chappell ordered his younger brother, Trevor to bowl the ball underarm along the ground.
This was one of cricket's most controversial moments of all time.

ODI laws were changed so that any ball delivered underarm would be called a no-ball.
1981–82 – In the final qualifying match, Australia defeated West Indies at Sydney on run-rate after rain washed out the last 6.5 overs of the match; the Melbourne Age newspaper later alleged that West Indies had deliberately lost the match to ensure that Australia got to the finals series ahead of Pakistan, which would result in a gain of $800,000 to the Australian Cricket Board in extra gate takings.
West Indian captain Clive Lloyd won a libel action and $100,000 in damages against the newspaper.
1982–83 – New Zealand breaks the world record for the highest successful run chase in an ODI, scoring 297–6 to surpass England's 296–5 in Adelaide .
The record stood until 1992.
1982–83 – In the second final at Melbourne versus Australia, New Zealander Lance Cairns scored the then World record fastest ODI fifty off 21 balls, hitting 6 sixes.
This is the still currently the fastest 50 in Australian Tri-Series matches.
1983–84 – The first ever tied One-day International took place in the second final at the MCG between Australia and West Indies , after Carl Rackemann was run out attempting the winning run.
1984–85 – West Indies were the first team to go through the qualifying round unbeaten by winning all 10 matches.
Although they lost the first match v Australia, they came back from behind to win the finals series 2–1.

1985–86 – After having clinched a finals berth, Australia was defeated by New Zealand by 206 runs in Adelaide after being bowled out for 70.
This remains Australia's heaviest defeat by runs in ODI history.
1985–86 – Australian fast bowler Bruce Reid took the first hat-trick in the history of the Australian Tri-series in Sydney versus New Zealand on 29 January 1986.
1986–87 – This season was the first time the 4-times Tri-Series champions, West Indies did not make the finals as England beat Australia 2–0.
Mike Gatting 's side also won that season's Ashes Test match series and the Perth Challenge one day tournament.
1988–89 – The first match of that season's tournament, West Indies v Pakistan , Adelaide , 10 December 1988, was the first one day international to feature shirts bearing the player's names.
1988–89 – In the third final at Sydney, rain stopped play for one hour and 25 minutes with West Indies at 47/2 after 6.4 overs chasing Australia's 4/226 off 38 overs, and West Indies target was revised to 108 off the 18 overs that remained; West Indies won the match  with 4.4 overs remaining after Desmond Haynes hit Steve Waugh for six.
Australian fans loudly booed this unsatisfactory conclusion, and criticism from the media led to the average run rate method being replaced by the most productive overs method for setting revised targets in interrupted matches.
1992–93 – West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons recorded bowling figures of 4/3 from 10 overs against Pakistan in Sydney .
These remain the most economical bowling figures in one-day international history .

1995–96 – The first match in the tournament, West Indies v Sri Lanka Adelaide , 15 December 1995, was the first One Day International that featured numbers and names on the back of player's shirts after they were introduced for that season's Mercantile Mutual Cup tournament.
1996–97 – Australia misses the finals for the first time since the 1979–80 Series; it is also the first time West Indies finish as Runners-up, with Pakistan winning the series 2 – 0, and not even a blackout in the 2nd final could stop them from winning.
2000–01 – Mark Waugh scored 173 runs for Australia against West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , the highest innings total in Australian Tri-Series history.
2001–02 – Australia misses the finals for a third time, South Africa wins the finals 2 – 0 over New Zealand.
2003–04 – Ajit Agarkar recorded bowling figures of 6/42 from 9.3 overs against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
It was the first and, to date, only six wicket haul in an Australian Tri-series match.
2005–06 – In the third final at Brisbane , Adam Gilchrist scored the fastest century in Australian Tri-Series history off 67 balls versus Sri Lanka .
2006–07 – Despite losing 5–0 to the Australians in the Ashes , England staged a comeback to win the tri-series against them.
2011–12 – Daniel Christian became the 31st person , and only the 4th Australian, to take a One Day hat-trick .

Indian fast bowlers have a history of dropping their pace dramatically as their careers take off - Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel and to some extent Ishant Sharma - but Aaron, who regularly clocks over 140kph and impressed for India Emerging Players during the recent tournament in Australia, said he will not go down that road."It's
an individual thing, I guess.
I don't know why they decided to give up on their pace.
I love bowling fast, and it is my strength.
I will never compromise on my pace," he told the Indian Express.
"And it's a lot of fun to hit people on the head.
"Aaron,who played for Delhi Daredevils in this year's IPL, does know the value of accuracy too.
"Speed is okay; you have to bowl quick.

But it troubles international batsmen only to a certain extent.
After that, they adjust pretty easily," he told Reuters.
"You have got to have a few tricks up your sleeve and you have got to bowl a good line and length consistently to get wickets.
Even genuine fast bowlers have to have the right line and length."With
India struggling in the pace department in England, there were calls for Aaron, who is just 21, to be drafted into the national team, and when Ishant sustained an ankle injury, Aaron was called up to the one-day squad.
He, however, said he would not be bogged down by the pressure of expectation.
"It's tough to ignore the expectations that people have.
But I don't want to think about that and I'm concentrating on bowling as fast and as well as I can."One thing that could work in Aaron's favour is that the assistant coach at Delhi Daredevils is Eric Simons, who is also India's bowling coach.
"Working with Eric was great," Aaron said.

"Generally, he just tells you to do the most basic of things perfectly or a small little change here or there which somehow you fail to notice.
But I am always open to advice."Aaron
took 13 wickets for Jharkhand during last year's Ranji season, followed by another nine in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, during which he reportedly bowled a 153-kph ball.
He took 10 wickets in three games in the three-day leg of the Emerging Players Tournament , including 4 for 40 in the first innings against Australia Institute of Sport.
Dhoni should take break from IPL and CL, atleast he should give up captaincy and wicket keeping in IPL and CL
zico123 on August 24, 2011, 15:16 GMT
There ought to be superior remuneration or compensation for Test cricketers compared to IPL or CL, if India wants to produce great young test players, otherwise all we would get is good young T20 playerson August 24, 2011, 14:39 GMTlets hope finally we find the fastest pace battery for  indian team..!!Kaze on August 24, 2011, 14:08 GMTI wonder if he got it thru his head that pace isn't everything.
If he is inaccurate which he probably will be, trying for more pace, then he will get carted around the park like the rest of indian pie chuckers.Percy_Fender on August 24, 2011, 13:39 GMTSomething tells me that Jharkhand will be the fast bowlers Shivaji Park from where many great Indian batsmen have made it big.If Varun makes a mark it will no doubt motivate many others from that area to emulate him.
Besides the tribals of this area have a different kind of body make up which mat be different to people elsewhere.
For the good of the game I do hope my expectations are not belied.
India needs to wipe the blackboard and start afresh.

It does'nt matter if they lose many before they start winning.It is also nice to hear that Varun Aaron is comfortable with Eric Simmons and that he  keeps his coaching to the very minimum.
Aaron should develop on his own by watching others like Steyn and Fidel Edwards either in the IPL or in TV replays.
That is important.
Any training is good only when one learns by oneself.I also wish he would run and do yoga .This Gym culture is what has made Indian players unfit most of the time.amit.80s

Golden chance for Varun hope he grab the oppurtunity and hope Dhoni let him play in all 5ODIs but I know for sure he will go for RP, Sree and Munaf.
Just  like he gives Sree and then RP a chane ahead of Munaf.AvidCricFan on August 24, 2011,  0:17 GMTThe formidable Indian team was built around very young talent back in mid to late 90's with the likes of Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman, Ganguly and Shewag being late addition.

on August 23, 2011, 17:46 GMTThe shortage of top class fast bowling in India traditionally has been due to a wrong attitude by most Indians.
They lack self belief that an Indian rarely bowls fast.
How may fast bowling talent has been wasted in the last 70 years.
In 1974, for The England tour they failed to pick potentially a genuine fast bowler in Salgaonkar.
In the 90's they did not pick Abhay Kuruvilla and Salil Ankola in the right time.
What a wonderful pace battery we would have with Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad.
Kuruvilla was finally selected when well past his prime abd Ankola was wasted after a lone teast.
Our attitude to fast bowling is line and length and not pace.
Hopefully, the new prospect Varun is presisted with and given a longer run to eastablish himself.
What about Umesh Yadav who too bowls at 140 Kmph and above.
Why not Yadav too along with Varun.
Our selection is always conservative and lacks confidence in development of fast bowlers.
This has been our major failing unlike Pakistan.marunraj007
on August 23, 2011, 17:41 GMTon August 23, 2011, 16:40 GMTLet,s hope he continue to bowl FAST...he bowled really Fast during I.P.L....we need some guy,s with killer INSTINCT.... UMESH YADAV,another guy who bowl,s even faster than VARUN... should get a call... Irfan pathan ignored,, was fit for english condition,s... anyway,s VARUN this is ur chance MATE...cash on...on August 23, 2011, 16:19 GMTHaleos on August 23, 2011, 14:47 GMT@Rahul_Paharia - Current bowlers failed to take out the tailenders too.
so it is not a bad thing if his wickets are all tailenders.
Haleos on August 23, 2011, 14:44 GMTGood luck to Varun.
Atlast an Indian Fast bowler who could be called fast and enjoys hitting the ball on the head.
Others before him weer too meek.
Even srinath was a meek bowler.
I hopt he has the Poms jumping.
Lts have some chin music now.zico123 on August 23, 2011, 13:10 GMTvery good replacement, rather than picking older guys like badrinath or nehra, it will be exiciting to see young starts Ajinkya Rahane and Varun Aaron getting a chance, i wish they have a good series, Varun Aaron should NOT compromise on pacepuneet_usa on August 23, 2011, 12:44 GMTwhen Players like Sachin,Sehwag,Dhoni,Yuvraj can pick and choose when to play for India and when to opt out of a tour like the recent WI trip- Something serious needs to happen- Because this shows their commitment to their country- this shows that they are focused on extending their aged career to the max rather than moving on with the course of action and accepting the facts- Now there is no hiding- It's all open in public- Where will we go from here is the NEXT BIG QUESTION?? ARE WE HOPING AGAINST HOPE?? How come these players were fit enough to play a total of 30+matches within a span of 2 so months- How come they maintain so exceptional fitness regardless it was a 20-20 format because they didn't even lasted for 20 overs throughout the test series in England- ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS PEOPLE?
I AM TERRIBLY CONFUSED WITH THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WHICH THESE PLAYERS HAVE BEEN GOING ABOUT CRICKET AND MORE SO PEOPLE AT TOP IN BCCI- EVERYONE'S HONEST FEEDBACK WILL BE APPRECIATED?? THANKS A LOT.on August 23, 2011, 12:02 GMTWell this is exactly how a pace merchant needs to be.
Once u do what u say the entire nation will worship u , let me see the Allan Donald and kapil dev in u.
God bless Indiadrvikram on August 23, 2011, 11:14 GMTon August 23, 2011, 11:05 GMTon August 23, 2011, 10:58 GMT@fuji kayo VARUN IS only 21 so avg does nt matter.i
have seen him bowl and i beleive he is a special talent as is umesh yadav.............DINESHCC on August 23, 2011, 10:28 GMTon August 23, 2011, 10:08 GMTon August 23, 2011,  9:42 GMTThis guy only has some pace which is not xtraordinary.......
And he will also join Munaf in a few months time........VixV on August 23, 2011,  9:36 GMTThere is nothing above the passion for cricket which makes players best regardless of the conditions.
Look at Pakistan or for that matter Malinga or WI team of 70's.
They do not have much favourable conditions for fast bowlers but still from the top fast bowlers list you will find most of the bowlers from these countries.
This would not be right ot say Varon cannot trouble batsmen around the world.
He will, all he need to do is learn everytime he is playing internatinal cricket.
ALL THE BEST.............I hope ENGLAND would terrified...as they should be now.on
August 23, 2011,  5:04 GMTThe life of a fast bowler is generally shorter than a spinner for obvious reasons.But if you follow the right way to manage your run up,delivery stride etc. you can have a long innings like Lillee,Hadlee,Holding,Ambrose etc. India need not one but at least five more Aaron's as bench strength.The BCCI has the coffers full.They need to pick the right boys & groom them well & make them bowl to the seniors at the nets,not only in India but also on the tour across the seas.Dravid_Pujara_Gravitas on August 23, 2011,  4:36 GMTPeople who haven't seen him might ridicule him.
Fair enough to suspect Indian Pacers.
But bowling at 145 KMPH is common for him with awkward bounce as well.
He touches 150 KMPH very regularly with just some effort.
He will be a handful on pace friendly tracks.champion1469
on August 23, 2011,  2:09 GMT@shamlaatu, i like what your saying for most the most part, although its a little disrespectful to say that bowlers had it easier back in the 70s etc. they had more warm up games, played for their clubs etc a lot more, were paid less, and didnt have nearly the amount of help teams and players have now.
agree that commercialism has ruined certain aspects of the game, noticably the idea that cricket is a CONTEST! finally, if this guy has the determination and a decent enough action, without bad management and 'helpers' he can go as far as he wantson August 22, 2011, 23:54 GMTFinally an Indian who wants to hit someone on the head.
Good sign.wolf777 on August 22, 2011, 23:20 GMTFetish of picking only four bowlers in the eleven will leave him overworked and pretty soon he will join Ishant Sharma, Zaheer Khan and others in rehabilitation.
India need to pick an allrounder such as Irfan Pathan to lessen the workload on the fast bowlers.on
August 22, 2011, 19:48 GMT@Prash Smith: yes, he averages nearly 40 in First Class, however he has been selected for ODIs, so did you check that his List A avg on SAME Cricinfo Profile is 17.47?on
August 22, 2011, 19:46 GMTIn the words of Donald Sutherland from the movie "Dirty Dozen" "All very pretty Colonel but can they fight" Very apt words when describing this new call up for India.on
August 22, 2011, 19:23 GMTAaron should have been in the squad to begin with, at least as an experiment.
He's not fast enough to destroy a good batting line-up with pace alone , but is certainly a more promising prospect than burned-out semi-discards like Munaf and RP Singh.
Of course, in two years, he will be a burn-out too, and then we'll need another one.
Ishant Sharma close to that fate himself.shamlaatu on August 22, 2011, 19:12 GMTThe kid doesn't know it's not the 70 and  the 80's era anymore.
Today cricket is being played to such an astronomical amount that it's almost impossible for a genuine pacer to consistently deliver fire.
The  humanly body of a fast bowler just CANNOT take THAT  much.
Imran Khan has been saying this for the last 8 years but looks like for ICC BCCI and for the players themselves,  money matters more than preserving the golden art of fast bowling.
Would anyone be surprised to see boundary lines being shrinked another 10 yards inside the ground, enforcement of permanent powerplay field setup, and permission to use tree trunks in the name of cricket bats JUST SO THAT THE BATSMEN COULD HIT MORE SIXES AND MORE FOURS so the crowd is entertained and money keeps pouring in?
These kids a T20 game; a pacer runs into his run up, passes by the umpire and gets thrashed for 2 sixes and 3 fours in a 70 yard ground!
WHO WANTS TO BE A PACE BOWLER ??maddy20 on August 22, 2011, 19:12 GMTThis guy is real quick and really accurate.
Those who are talking against him don't obviously know what they are talking about.
Atleast two of his 6 deliveries every over hit the 150KPH mark.
Groomed well this guy can be our Dale Steyn!SibaMohanty on August 22, 2011, 19:07 GMTon August 22, 2011, 18:26 GMTIt's difficult to sustain pace over long periods in Indian conditions.. Fast bowling can be sapping and the harsh weather in tropical countries like India drains your stamina..Its OK to be an intimidating fast bowler like the former west Indian greats, but in International cricket, you need to to stick to line & length with clever & subtle variations to get wickets.. What pace did McGrath have to rattle the modern day greats like Sachin & Lara..Even the West Indian quickies of the yesteryear, prostrated before Sunny Gavaskar's immaculate technique & courage..Pace bowling is all about discipline, intelligence and perseverance and not just a mad pursuit to touching the 100 MPH mark as was done by Shoaib Akhtar of Pak..on August 22, 2011, 18:17 GMTAs someone suggested in the thread, India might as well try Wasim Akram for a short stint as Fast Bowling Coach.
He is a genius.
Its on record how he groomed first Aqib Javed  and then helped Waqar Younis, Shoaib Akram and inspired many others like Aamir, Sami, etc to bowl quick.
Prasad also did well at coaching bowlers.
All is not lost for India.
With its population, and craze for cricket, they can produce top bowlers easily.
Follow what Pakistan does for fast bowlers.
Bring a raw talent direct into the team.
Bowling is different from Batting.
Fast bowlers dont come with technique, they have a natural talent and flair at bowling fast.
They can do the job best when young.shefil on August 22, 2011, 17:47 GMTon August 22, 2011, 17:39 GMTIf India is to make good talent into great cricketers, they should chart proper career paths for them.
India is now trying to do what Australia has been hopelessly doing for the past year or so.
He just played a good emerging players trophy and a couple of seasons on First class for a middle of road state team and suddenly he is shoved into limelight.
Please make him play quality First class matches  India A tour to England, Australia and S Africa.
Or else get him a contract with a quality Ranji side so that he is atleast ensured a regular dose of bowling long spells.
Until an unless a bowler bowls long spell at first class level he cannot do the same at test level.on
August 22, 2011, 17:37 GMTIshant Sharma once bowled 152kph delivery against Australia in 2008.
Then he had a chat with Venkatesh Prasad and hasn't bowled above 140kph.
There was similar talk about pace when Munaf Patel came on the scene.
It was said that Munaf had Steve Waugh jumping in the nets.
How fast Munaf bowls is for everyone out there to see.on August 22, 2011, 17:10 GMTIf he can bowl 153kmph then why the hell he was not impressive in IPL :\knan on August 22, 2011, 17:08 GMTIn England you need a bowler who can swing/move the ball at a speed of 140 and above.
Not sure if Aaron is the one .
Would have been better to keep him back for this series and instead take him to Australia.
If he were to fail here, he will not be taken to Aus where he can do better on fast and bouncy tracksTiger-Khan on August 22, 2011, 17:01 GMTo well like all indian fast bowlers of the modern era one shot of this bloke tells you he is not up to scratch...Ganchu on August 22, 2011, 16:45 GMTon August 22, 2011, 16:35 GMTUmesh yadhav, varun aaron, ishant sharma, shreesanth .

Who knows indian Pace battery could become like westindies of 80s.on

Bring fresh air to Team India.getsetgopk on August 22, 2011, 15:25 GMThahaha they all say the same no one wants to drop their pace it comes natural to indian bowlers turn into medium pacers after a few matches what makes him think he's any different btw pace is not the only thing that makes you a good fast bowler there is a thing called control, and agression comes from having an agressive mind set most important to a fast bowlers and things like reverse swing and the ability to bowl yorkers at will is still a distant dream for an indian 'fast' bowler.ATG1207 on August 22, 2011, 15:18 GMTI hope he turns out to be a revolutionary bowler for indian team.
Afterall, india has not seen a revolution in bowling department since ages.
Good Luck Aaron!on August 22, 2011, 15:01 GMTHe joined our team as fast bowler but when he returned back then he turned into medium pacer bowler just because of our board policy..
But i wish it won't let it happened with Aaron.
I pray for his career and wish you a very good luck for ongoing series.. lets rock and bounce back in this series.. India's Rockmensan on August 22, 2011, 14:38 GMTon August 22, 2011, 14:37 GMTon August 22, 2011, 14:29 GMTon August 22, 2011, 14:25 GMTIqbal Abdulla also deserved selection, he has Man of the Series in the Emerging Players Tournamentudit9 on August 22, 2011, 13:45 GMTShenoys on August 22, 2011, 13:29 GMTAlso make it mandatory for any players not to get endorsed / sign any contractual agreements with companies wherein which they earn more n more than their match fees, coz after one stellar performance by a player, he is  carried away by the glory of MNC's ready to endorse for their products / make them their brand ambassodors.I'm not blaming the companies r the players r the board for such an act.
If a player is regularly able to show off his onscreen skills for various brands of differnet countries, why is that he is not able to do it regularly at the pitch in different countires.dsig3
on August 22, 2011, 13:28 GMTIs it a case that anyone who plays in India and bowls at 140kmh gets selected for the squad?
After all this time India's ideas on fast bowling are muddled.Shenoys on August 22, 2011, 13:22 GMTIts nice to see a fast bowlers blossom in India, but more heartbreaking to see them crushed even before they prove themselves with only limited chances.
There are really good fast bowlers in somewhere around rural & other areas who are vying for a chance to prove.
These talented guys needs to be groomed & sent on tours with "A" & Junior teams regularly, so when they have an opportunity they're ready to prove themselves @ intnl level.
Also put them in a situation where "it is the current form that matters".
What BCCI needs to do at this time is to avoid selection based on past glories of players irrespective of their seniority.
Give chance to those who are really capable of putting it.TwitterJitter on August 22, 2011, 13:09 GMTJust remember that the faster you bowl the faster the ball will be dispatched to the fence.
Focus on basics: Line, length, and a touch of inswing and outswing and thinking ability to outwit the batsmen by keeping him guessing about the next ball.
Pace alone is a cure for nothing.
I don't have much hope for pace bowling from India.
Kapil was an aberration and needs to be much admired in hindsight.
India is more likely if at all of producing  more Gavaskars and Tendulkars in future than Kapil Devs.jonesy2 on August 22, 2011, 13:01 GMTon August 22, 2011, 12:52 GMTLet us get him and throw him out...so the poor kid does not know what hit him...do we really have  a plan for bowlers like him.
Eric simmons is a good guy but if need to nurse aaron and yadavs we need a guy who bowled fast as the coach...Aakram??on August 22, 2011, 12:50 GMTAll the best Aaron....
I have been waiting for your presence indian team... God bless you young fastest indian bowler....on August 22, 2011, 12:46 GMTI have heard of Varun Aaron before and to be honest it all looks nice and pretty on paper that he bowls over 140Kph and that he's so fast apparently but the bottom line is he averages nearly 40 in first class cricket and has taken a handful of wickets.
His bowling figures are terrible and if this is the best replacement India have to offer then I dont think any other teams have anything to fear from India over the next few years.
Varun aaron is also described as "medium fast" by cricinfo bio section which suggests he probably is a bit inconsistent with his speed.
Apparently he enjoys hitting batsmen on the head also...well i wonder if he will enjoy being hooked and pulled for 4 or 6 by the English batsman during the ODIs?
lol.
I can see this happening as hs bouncers might scare the indian batsman on home pitches but England have nothing to worry about from this medicre new find form india.coolchaitu on August 22, 2011, 12:31 GMTon August 22, 2011, 12:15 GMTHope he brings some good luck for India & take some wickets.NairUSA on August 22, 2011, 11:26 GMTIt is not fair piling on pressure on Aaron just because the highly paid senior pacers failed miserably.
Nurture him and others like him so that we have a decent pace attack.
Best of luck, Aaron!Naresh28 on August 22, 2011, 11:20 GMTIts nice to see a fast blowler emerge in India.
I suspect there are other good fast bowlers in somewhere in India.
I once read an article of one such bowler who broke a stump with his pace.
A rural India bowler.
India needs these sort who can rev and give back.
Also there are Abid Nabi and Samiullah Beigh from Punjab area.
This talent needs to be harnessed and worked on.
Naresh28blondblackberry on August 22, 2011, 10:46 GMThope he wil b the fast bowler india needs come on prove like dhoni ur one of the best.fearless69 on August 22, 2011, 10:29 GMTEhh, thats my man!!
I was waiting for him..
He made it for the selection..
The bowler of his calibre was missing in this Indian team.. Hez quick, i've seen him troubling Gilchrist & marsh during IPLs..
I want him to debut in 1st ODI against England..
All the very best Varon Aaron..Rahul_Paharia on August 22, 2011, 10:20 GMTWe should not get carried away with this guy.
He does not have any wickets to show even in the Ranji trophy, how do we expect him to succeed at the highest level.
The 4 for 40 being talked about comprised mainly of lower order wickets.
He should have bowled a couple of seasons in Ranji and shown consistent performances to be selected in the Indian team.

153kph.Source: ESPNcricinfo , 01 Octomber 2015Kumara "Kumar" Chokshanada Sangakkara  is a retired professional Sri Lankan cricketer , and former captain of the Sri Lankan national team .
He is widely regarded as one of the world's most influential cricketers.
A left-handed top-order batsman , he is also a record-breaking wicket-keeper , although he no longer keeps wickets at Test level.
Currently, he is the second-highest run-scorer in ODI cricket and the fifth-highest run scorer in Test cricket.
Sangakkara is described as one of the "most polished and prudent of batsmen" in cricket.
Sangakkara was a key member of the team that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and was part of the team that made the final of the 2007 Cricket World Cup , 2011 Cricket World Cup , 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and 2012 ICC World Twenty20 .
He won the Man of the Match award in the final of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, where he helped the team win their first title.He was the youngest person and the first active international player to deliver Crowdrey lecture, which was widely praised by the cricketing community for its outspoken nature.
In terms of number of innings required, Sangakkara is the fastest batsman to reach 8,000, 9,000, 11,000 and 12,000 runs in Test cricket.
He is also joint fastest to 10,000.
He has also won the LG People's Choice Award twice, in 2011 and 2012.
Sangakkara has regularly featured in the World Test XI and World ODI XI, appearing six times and three times in them, respectively.
He was selected as Leading Cricketer in the World in the 2015 edition of Wisden .He was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2011 and 2015.
He is one of two players to have won this award twice, along with Indian opener Virender Sehwag , who won the award in 2008 and 2009.On January 29, 2015, Sangakkara became Sri Lanka's highest ever ODI run scorer, surpassing the previous record of 13430 runs held by Sanath Jayasuriya .
In the same match, he also broke the record for ODI wicketkeeping dismissals, breaking the previous record of 472 held by Adam Gilchrist .Sangakkara was born to Kumari Surangana and Swarnakumara Sangakkara, an attorney-at-law at Matale , Sri Lanka in 1977.
His parents hid Tamil families during the Black July riots in 1983.
He represented his school's under-13 cricket XI under coach Upananda Jayasundera.
helped him secure a place at the Sri Lankan national cricket team later that year.Sanga was the Senior Prefect  of school, he did his Advanced Level examination in the Arts stream in 1996.
He was also awarded the highest honour of Trinity College, the Ryde Gold Medal , for the best all-round student in his year.
Following his father, who is a lawyer in Kandy, he entered the Law Faculty of the University of Colombo , but was unable to finish his degree due to cricket tours.
He was cited as an inspiration to continue his higher education by Bangladeshi captain Mushfiqur Rahim , upon receiving his master's degree:It is appreciated that someone like Sangakkara's sports personality is shaped by his education.
He is obviously an inspiration.
At the age of 22 Sangakkara made his Test debut on 20 July 2000, keeping wicket in the first fixture of a three-match series against South Africa .
Sri Lanka won the match and in his side's only innings Sangakarra batted at the fall of the third wicket and scored 23 runs before he was dismissed leg before wicket by spin bowler Nicky Boje .
He scored his first double-century against Pakistan in 2002, at the 2nd Asian Test Championship final.
In July 2005, he was selected to the ICC World XI ODI team but missed out from its Test counterpart .When Sri Lanka toured Bangladesh in February 2006 regular captain Marvan Atapattu was injured and Mahela Jayawardene became captain while Sangakkara was made vice-captain.
On 6 December 2007 he made it to the top spot of ICC Test player rankings with a rating of 938, the highest rating ever achieved by a Sri Lankan player, and became the first batsman ever to score in excess of 150 in four consecutive tests.
Sangakkara holds the record for being the fastest man to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 , 11,000 and 12,000 runs in Test cricket.
During Sri Lanka's tour to England in May 2006, he was named the vice-captain of the side.
On 3 March 2009, a terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team convoy in Pakistan injured 6 Sri Lankan players including Sangakkara.
Sangakkara suffered shrapnel wounds in his shoulder.
In February 2009, the then captain of the Sri Lankan side, Mahela Jayawardene announced that he would step down from captaincy "in the best interests of the Sri Lankan team".
He said he believed that it would give his successor around two years to build up to the 2011 Cricket World Cup .
Sri Lanka failed to reach to the knock-out stage of the ICC Champions Trophy in September 2009.
The next Indian tour proved to be disastrous for the team, with Sri Lanka being beaten by India in Test series 2–0 and ODI series 3–1.Sri Lankan team under the captaincy of Sangakkara gained momentum and won the next Tri-series in Bangladesh , Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka , beating India as well.
The Sri Lankans' tour of Australia proved to be very successful, in winning both the T20 and ODI series.
This was Sri Lanka's first ever series victory in Australia.
A month in advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the captaincy after the tournament.
The same year, he was named the ODI Cricketer of the Year at the ICC awards ceremony .
See also: List of batsmen who have scored over 10000 One Day International cricket runsSri Lanka's first fixture after the World Cup was a Sri Lanka tour of England in 2011 beginning in May.
During the second match of a three Test series Tillakaratne Dilshan , Sangakkara's successor as captain, suffered a broken thumb.
Sangakkara filled-in while Dilshan was off the pitch and formally assumed the captaincy for the final Test.
Sangakkara was named the man of the series in Test series with Pakistan in 2011/12 —his first man of the series award in Test cricket.
He made 516 runs in the 3 match series which was won by Pakistan 1–0.
Sangakkara struggled when England toured Sri Lanka in 2012.
He failed to score a half century during The Two Test match series.
But he regained his form in the ODI series against Pakistan where he twice scored in the 90s.
In the following Test series Sangakkara continued his form with a 199, the scoreboard originally said he had scored the double century but it turned out to be a mistake.
Sri Lanka later won the Test match.
He followed this up with 192 in the game, again missing out on the double century.
Sri Lanka drew the next two matches meaning Sri Lanka won the series 1–0.
The first time they won a Test series since the retirement of Muttiah Muralitharan .On the Sri Lankan tour of Bangladesh in 2014, Sangakarra hit his highest test score to date with 319 in the first innings of the second test.
Making him only the third Sri Lankan player to hit a triple century after Sanath Jayasuria and Mahela Jayawardena .
He followed his triple century with a knock of 105 in the 2nd innings as game finished as a draw.
He continued his good batting run with another century in the 2nd ODI.Along with teammate Mahela Jayawardene, he recorded the most partnership runs for the 3rd wicket in Tests, scoring 5890 runs surpassing the 5826 runs of Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar , during the first Test match against Pakistan at Galle International Stadium .
The two also hold the record for the highest partnership for any wicket in Test matches, scoring 624 runs for the 3rd wicket against South Africa in July, 2006.
His impressive form with the bat continued at the 2014 Asia Cup where he amassed a total of 245 runs in five innings.
He started the tournament with a 63 against Pakistan before hitting a match winning 103 against India .
He then added scores of 77 and 2 against Afghanistan and Bangladesh before being dismissed for a golden duck in the final against Pakistan.
Sri Lanka went on to win the game and the tournament.
Sangakkara decided to retire from T20 internationals after playing the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 .
Afterwards Jayawardene also followed him into retirement.
Sangakkara under performed in the World T20, but in the final match against India, he scored 51 runs not out off just 33 balls making his team win their second ICC trophy since 1996.Sri Lanka played their first 7-match ODI series at home, against England from 26 November to 16 December 2014.
During the series, on December 3, 2014 he completed 13,000 runs in One-day internationals in the third match of the series at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium , Hambantota , and became the fourth player in one-day history to achieve that feat after Sachin Tendulkar , Ricky Ponting , and Sanath Jayasuriya .
He also became the second most prolific half-century maker in One-day internationals during this match.
He scored 4 consecutive half-centuries followed by a century in this series.
On 13 December 2014, he scored his 20th ODI century, became the second Sri Lankan to score 20 ODI centuries, after 28 by Sanath Jayasuriya, and 9th overall to do so.
He also took 4 catches as a wicket-keeper in this match, became the player of the match.

Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , a non-profit organization.Brett Lee  is a former Australian international cricketer and a Channel Nine cricket commentator.
During his international career, Lee was recognised as one of the fastest bowlers in the world of cricket.
In each of his first two years, he averaged less than 20 with the ball, but since then has mostly achieved figures in the early 30s.
He was also known as an athletic fielder and useful lower-order batsman , with a batting average exceeding 20 in Test cricket.
Lee finished his Test with 310 wickets, and his One Day International career with 380 wickets.Lee featured in the Australian teams that won the 2003 and 2007 World Cups .
He announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket in January 2012, having played his first Test in 1999.
He subsequently declined to renew his contract with his home state side New South Wales , but continued to play Twenty20 matches for several seasons after, most notably in the Indian Premier League  and Big Bash League .
Lee was known for his pace and regularly clocked 90 mph and above.
He ranks only behind Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar , but it was not an official match and therefore not recognised by the ICC .Early in his career, Lee was reported for a suspected illegal bowling action, but was cleared,  His slower balls also has dramatic falls of pace with varying length, often from a cutter grip, where it can go as slow as 100 km/h , but it hovers on average around the 115 km/h-130 km/h range.
He is also known to celebrate many bowled wickets with a chainsaw celebration.Lee was a competent lower-order batsman.
Together with Mike Hussey , he has held the record for highest 7th wicket partnership for Australia in ODIs since 2005–06 with 123.
During the 2005 Ashes series, Lee had numerous defiant innings, including a stand of 43 not out in the Second Test at Edgbaston , Australia's highest individual score in that innings.
This innings nearly won the match for Australia but the other batsman Michael Kasprowicz was caught behind by Geraint Jones and England won by just two runs.
After the memorable match, England bowlers Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff went over to console Lee.
The image of Flintoff consoling Lee was a moment which came to symbolise a hotly contested series.
On 2 April 2006, Lee hit his highest Test score of 64 in 68 balls against South Africa at Johannesburg .
His previous highest score in Tests was 62 not out which he made against the West Indies in 2000 at the Gabba .
Lee nearly surpassed this score on 3 January 2008 against India when he made 59 off 121 balls.
Lee had also once again nearly surpassed his highest test score when he had made 63 not out, but unfortunately Ricky Ponting had declared the innings in the 2nd test against the West Indies.
As a result of this, he fell one run short of his highest test score.Lee started playing in the junior teams of his local side, Oak Flats Rats, and gradually worked his way up the ranks.
At 16 he began playing first grade cricket for Campbelltown , where he managed to claim the wickets of a few New South Wales cricketers, and Mosman , Lee was called up to the Australian Under 17 & 19 teams.
In March 1994, he was forced out of the Australian under-19 team to tour India due to stress fractures in his lower back and it forced him to remodel his bowling action to minimise the impact on his back.
He was awarded a scholarship to attend the AIS Australian Cricket Academy in the 1995–96 season.
Prior to making his first-class debut, Lee played for Mosman in the final of the 1996–97 Sydney Grade Cricket competition.
Lee was first named in the New South Wales Blues squad as the twelfth man for the 14–16 November match against Queensland in the 1997–98 Sheffield Shield .
During the 1998–99 season Lee was a more regular presence in the latter stages of the Sheffield Shield.
He took 14 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul against Tasmania in the second innings.
After a successful Test series against India, Lee returned to domestic cricket and was named in the 2008 Pura Cup final .
In Victoria's second innings, he took 4–72, dismissing the last four tailenders , as the Blues won the final.In 2009 he battled back from injury and was a key player in New South Wales' success during the Champions League Twenty20 .
During the final he played an important part with both bat and ball and was named Man of the Match.
Following his retirement from Test cricket, Lee stopped playing first-class cricket to concentrate on the limited-overs formats.
He was the Blues' highest wicket-taker in the 2010–11 Ryobi One-Day Cup with 15 wickets and had the second best economy rate of the top five wicket-takers despite missing the latter stages of the campaign due to international duty.In June 2012 he declined to renew his contract with the Blues, ending his 15-year association with his domestic team.
He retired from Big Bash League after playing the final match for the Sydney Sixers on 28 January 2015.
One month after making his first class debut, Lee was chosen to represent the Australian A team on a tour to South Africa.
He claimed two wickets but in that very match, stress fractures in his back from the previous injury had re-opened and Lee was in a back brace for over three months.By the late 1990s there were calls for Lee to be included in the national squad.
Captain Steve Waugh , who also played with him for New South Wales , was impressed by Lee's debut and pushed for his inclusion into the national team.
He was eventually chosen in the final 14 for the Test series against Pakistan in 1999 but failed to make the starting 11.
By the time the Test series against India came around, he was twelfth man .
However, he duly made his Test debut for Australia in December 1999 against the touring Indians , becoming Australia's 383rd Test cricketer.Bowling first change, Lee took a wicket in his first over in Test cricket when he bowled Sadagoppan Ramesh with his fourth delivery.
He also captured Rahul Dravid in his first spell before returning to take three wickets in six balls to finish the innings with figures of 5/47 from 17 overs, becoming the first Australian fast bowler since Dennis Lillee to take 5 wickets on debut.
Lee took thirteen wickets in his opening two Tests at the low average of 14.15.Lee won the inaugural Donald Bradman Young Player of the Year Award at the Allan Border Medal award ceremony in 2000 soon after his debut.Lee took 42 wickets in his opening three series, the most by any Australian bowler in the seven matches he played.
Lee returned to the international team for the 2001 Ashes series after recovering from an elbow injury.
His comeback saw less success than his debut, managing only nine wickets in five Tests at 55.11.
However, Lee was back as Australia's leading wicket-taker in the first and third Test against New Zealand later that year, in a series which he captured 5 wickets in the second innings and made a contribution of 61 with the bat in the first Test match.
The series ended in a 0–0 draw.
He finished the series with 14 wickets at 25.14.
The two home and away series against South Africa were not as productive, yielding 19 wickets in six Tests at 38.42.Lee only took five wickets in a match on three occasions between the New Zealand series and the 2003 Cricket World Cup .
Lee came under pressure for his position after taking only five wickets at 46.50 in the three-Test series against Pakistan in 2002.
Andy Bichel , who was filling for the injured Jason Gillespie , took eight wickets at 13.25.
With the other frontline bowlers all taking wickets at less than 13,  After the 2003 Cricket World Cup , Lee took 17 wickets at 28.88 in four Tests against the West Indies.
It was the first series in two years where he averaged under 30, and only the second in that period where had averaged under 40.After a mid year break, he participated in a Two Test series against Bangladesh in northern Australia.
He took six wickets at 31.66, and was Australia's most expensive bowler, with the other specialist bowlers averaging 15.55 against the lowest ranked team in Test cricket.
He followed this with six wickets at 37 in a comfortable 2–0 Test series against Zimbabwe, in which the other specialist bowlers averaged 23.15.
Against the Indian batting line-up in the 2003–04 home series, which ended in a 1–1 draw for Australia, Lee was out of the first two Tests recovering from a torn abdominal muscle, an injury which he sustained during the Zimbabwe series.
Loss of Test positionLee took eight wickets in 100 overs in the final two Tests against India, at an average of 59.50.
This Test included a double century to Sachin Tendulkar in the Indians' first innings of 7/705 where Sachin and V.V.S. Laxman freely attacked Lee and other bowlers in the final Test in Sydney.
He ended the series with the worst average and economy rate of Australia's front line bowlers.
He was subsequently replaced by fellow fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz in 2004 during the tour of Sri Lanka when Lee's ankle injury worsened, forcing him to return home to have surgery.
This injury would force Lee out of the game for 4½ months to ensure his full recovery.
Lee's form in the Test arena had been ineffective, and from July 2001 to January 2004, he had a Test bowling average of 38.42,  compared to an average of 16.07 in his earlier career.Lee was unable to reclaim his position for eighteen months, when Kasprowicz took 47 wickets at 23.74 in thirteen Tests, taking his wickets at a much lower cost than Lee had done in the previous three years.
This included 17 wickets at 26.82 on the spin friendly pitches of the Indian subcontinent, helping Australia to its first whitewash in Sri Lanka, and its first series win in India for 35 years.
Brett Lee bowling against South Africa at the WACA in 2005After 18 months on the sidelines, Lee returned to the Test team in the 2005 Ashes series.
With Kasprowicz and Jason Gillespie both struggling for form, Lee returned to take the new ball with Glenn McGrath .
He averaged 40 with the ball for the series, which some commentators have put down to having to bowl longer spells than he was accustomed to at the time which yielded runs at an average of 26.33.
During the Ashes, he claimed his 150th test wicket off Andrew Strauss with a straight yorker on Day 1 of the third test.Part of Lee's difficulty at Test level is that the benefits of his high speed, which give the batsmen less reaction time, also results in more erratic bowling.
In recent times he has tried to concentrate solely on accuracy by reducing speed.
During the first Test against the West Indies in late 2005 at the Gabba , after declaring that he would sacrifice pace and focus on 'line and length',  This saw him take 5/30 his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests, his first in four years.In the 2005-06 Australian cricket season , Lee's Test figures improved from his 2001–04 difficulties, with a season bowling average of 25.74.During South Africa's 2005–06 tour of Australia, Lee's form saw a steady improvement, with figures of 5/93 in the first Test at Perth .
He finished the three Test series with 13 wickets and of the Australian bowlers, was second only to Shane Warne 's 14 wickets in the series.
Three Australian players including Lee, who was reprimanded in the Third Test in Sydney for showing dissent towards umpire Aleem Dar .
With the unavailability of Glenn McGrath for the tour of South Africa in March–April 2006, Lee became the spearhead of the Australian bowling line-up.
In the first three tests of the 2006–07 Ashes series , he only took eight wickets and was fined for excessive appealing in the Third Test in Adelaide when a LBW decision was not in his favour.
Following the retirements of Warne and McGrath, Lee rose to the challenge and was awarded the Man of the Series in the inaugural Warne-Muralidaran Trophy , a two-Test series against Sri Lanka in late-2007.
In his first series as bowling spearhead reaped 16 wickets at an average of 17.5.
This was achieved by bowling 5 km/h slower to improve accuracy.
In the following series Lee took 24 wickets at 22.58 in four Tests against India.
In this series he overtook Jason Gillespie to become Australia's 5th highest wicket taker.
His consistent efforts saw him rewarded with the Man of the Series Award for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , 2007–08.
He capped off the season by winning the Allan Border Medal , the award given to the player adjudged Australia's best international cricketer of the past year.Lee seemed underdone in the 2008 Australian tour of the West Indies, taking only 5 wickets in the first Test match, during which he seemed exhausted.
He returned to productivity, taking eight wickets in the Second test, including a 5 wicket haul, and 6 in the Third Test.During the Indian tour, Lee picked up a stomach virus and was unable to find his best form throughout the series.
Lee showed glimpses of his best form when the team returned to Australia for a two test series with New Zealand, but generally seemed down on pace.
However, he struggled in the two tests he played of the series with South Africa, which Australia lost 2–1, likely due to a niggling ankle injury and then a stress fracture he developed during the series .
The fracture broke completely during the second innings of the Boxing Day Test-match and he was forced to return home for surgery.By the time he returned to the Australian team for the Ashes in 2009, his position as spearhead had been usurped by the left armer Mitchell Johnson .
Additionally, the arrival of bowlers like Peter Siddle , Ben Hilfenhaus and Doug Bollinger ensured that Lee had to fight for a position in the team.
However, he took six wickets in the first innings against the England Lions team in a practice match leading up to the Ashes.
Lee was the only bowler to get reverse swing in this match and appeared to be in line for selection for the First Test at Cardiff.
However, he picked up a left side strain and a sore rib in this match and he was ruled out of the first three Tests.
He was then overlooked for a recall and never played test cricket again, announcing his retirement from test cricket at the beginning of 2010.Lee had been considering retiring from Test cricket for some time since 2008 due to the physical strain.
In February 2010, he announced his retirement from Test cricket after consulting friend and England rival Andrew Flintoff , stating that bowling "at 150km/h for five days is very hard on the body".
He had been out with a string of injuries and had not played a Test since December 2008.
He ended his Test career with 310 wickets in 76 tests, the fourth highest Australian total behind Shane Warne , Glenn McGrath and Dennis Lillee .Lee bowling against Pakistan at Lord's , 2004-09-04Lee made his One Day International debut for Australia against Pakistan on 9 January 2000 during the Carlton and United Breweries Series at the Gabba , Brisbane .
He became the 140th ODI cricketer to represent Australia.
In February 2002 against South Africa , he scored his first ODI half century , 51* not out.In One-day Internationals, he was ranked by the ICC as the No. 1 ODI bowler in January 2006  and has been ranked among the top ten ODI bowlers since the start of 2003.
His bowling strike rate of around 30 puts him amongst the most incisive in this form of the game.
He also has a One-day International hat-trick to his name, achieved in the 2003 World Cup against Kenya .
Lee was the first Australian and fourth bowler to ever achieve this feat in World Cup history.In the matches Australia played in the 2005–06 triangular one day series , Lee gave a display of his useful batting abilities by making 57 in the second game in a 100 run partnership with Michael Hussey to pull Australia out of a middle order collapse.
Lee finished the series with 15 wickets, the third highest tally behind Nathan Bracken and Muttiah Muralitharan .His bowler-fielder partnership with long-time international teammate and wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist yielded 58 wickets in 151 matches, the fourth highest of all time in ODI history.
With main bowler Shane Warne banned from the 2003 World Cup the day before the opening match, Lee moved up the pecking order and, together with Andy Bichel and Glenn McGrath , formed one of the tournament's most lethal attacks, claiming 59 wickets between them.
Lee concluded the tournament with 22 wickets off 83.1 overs at an average of 17.90, a wicket behind Sri Lankan left-arm fastbowler Chaminda Vaas .
Lee also had a third leading strike-rate of 22.68 behind West Indian fast bowler Vasbert Drakes and Australian counterpart Andrew Bichel who topped the strike-rates with 19.43 and 21.37 respectively.

He was left out of the test side during the Ashes but was in the one-day side for the NatWest Series in September.

.Despite competition from younger bowlers and another injury setback, Lee managed to make the squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup .
He finished the tournament with 13 wickets, the highest of all the bowlers in the team.
Of the 13 wickets, 4 came in the match against Pakistan but it was not enough as Australia lost the match and eventually crashed out at the quarterfinals to rivals India .Against the West Indies in March 2012 he hit his highest score, 59 before getting caught off a ball by Kemar Roach .

born 1 November 1974), commonly known as V. V. S. Laxman, is a former Indian cricketer.
Laxman bats right-handed and occasionally bowls off-spin.
He is noted for his superb timing and the ability to hit against the spin, reminiscent of his role model Mohammed Azharuddin .
Laxman is particularly noted for the skilful use of his supple wrists, which allow him to flick the ball to various places, but usually through the leg side.
This also helps in his catching, and he typically fields in the slips or in a bat pad position.Laxman is noted most for his batting against Australia , in both Tests and One Day Internationals .
Six out of his 17 Test hundreds, and four out of his six ODI hundreds have come against Australia.
Laxman was born in Hyderabad in Telangana .
He married G. R. Shailaja from Guntur , who is a post-graduate in computer applications on 16 February 2004.
They have two children – a son, Sarvajit and a daughter, Achinthya.Recently he attended Food for Change along with Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Pulela Gopichand for the charity event of educating 2 lakh students.Laxman is known for his "wristy, willowy and sinuous" style, one which is technically fluid at its best.
Laxman's on-side playing capability is comparable with his fellow Hyderabadi Mohammed Azharuddin 's.
The Australians once admitted that they did not know where to bowl to him.
Laxman is widely criticised as a slow runner between the wickets and he is one of the few players who have played 100 Tests but have never played in the Cricket World Cup .
Despite being a slow runner between wickets, Laxman could score rapidly as he was such a fine stroke player and could play freely for long periods of time.VVS Laxman with his family at Teri University , receiving the doctoral degree.Technically sound, Laxman stands tall and still at the crease, with a keen awareness of the off-stump and a polished ability to dispatch the bad ball.
He plays with a high elbow and a steady stance and a textbook technique with natural elegance and flair.
At the start of his career, Laxman was rated by Geoffrey Boycott as one of India's best current players of the hard  ball.
Indian selectors also thought on those lines and asked Laxman to open on a number of occasions.
But Laxman came into his own only when he was asked to bat in the middle order.
Laxman has played some of his best match-winning innings while playing at no. 3, no. 5 and no. 6.
His score of 281 against Australia rang in a new era of Indian dominance which culminated in India gaining the no. 1 spot in test cricket a few years later.
His 281 is rated by many as the best ever innings played by an Indian batsman.
He made that score while batting at number 3, having been moved up the order from no. 6 for the second innings of the test match.Laxman made his Under-19 debut for India against Australia in February 1994.
Laxman made his first-class debut for Hyderabad against Punjab in the quarter-final match of 1992–93 Ranji Trophy season.
He scored a duck in the first innings and 17 in the second.
Laxman made his Test debut in 1996 against South Africa at Ahmedabad , scoring a fifty in the second innings of the match.
Laxman returned to playing first-class cricket in 1999 to regain his place in the national team.
In the 1999–2000 season of Ranji Trophy, he broke the record for most runs in a Ranji season when he made 1415 runs, at an average of 108, in just 9 matches notching up eight hundreds – a record that still remains intact.
His performance was rewarded when, in January 2000, he was recalled in the Indian squad for the Australian tour.
He scored 167 in the third and final Test match at Sydney when the rest of the batsmen struggled to cope with Glenn McGrath 's destructive bowling,  a rare high point for India in an otherwise disastrous tour.
Despite this success against an attack containing both McGrath and Shane Warne , Laxman apparently decided that he would return to domestic cricket, rather than continue playing as opener, a role which he believed did not suit him.
As a result, Laxman was out of the Test team for nearly a year.
He was recalled in late 2000, and also found a spot in the side for the home series against Australia in 2001.Australia's tour of India Laxman's career changed dramatically in the home series against Australia .
In the first Test at Mumbai , Laxman made 20 and 12, as the entire Indian batting line-up, with the exception of Sachin Tendulkar , capitulated, leading to a 10-wicket defeat.
West Indies and Australia tours Laxman then cemented his place both in the Test and one day teams for a few years.
After bad performances in the Test series against Zimbabwe , he did well in the first two ODIs scoring 75 and 52, but couldn't convert the starts into big knocks in the next three matches.
Laxman managed to score a fighting 89 in the second Test at Port Elizabeth , when the rest of the team struggled to survive against Shaun Pollock 's deadly bowling, helping his team put up 201 on the board and avoid an embarrassing follow-on.
Against the touring England in late 2001, he scored 75, sharing a 100-plus run partnership with Tendulkar to take his team out of trouble.
He had a great tour of West Indies , as he scored 474 runs in 8 innings at an average of 79.
He had scores of 69, 69*, 74, 1, 43, 130, 65* and 23 in that series.
He performed reasonably well during West Indies tour of India as well, particularly in the third match at Kolkata , where he scored 48 and 154*.
He followed it up with brilliant showing in the 7-match ODI series as well with scores of 47, 99, 66 and 71 in the first five games.
But his form dropped during India's tour of New Zealand in 2002/03.
In the first Test at Wellington , he got a pair and in the second match he could score only 23 and 4.
However, he had a brilliant 2-match Test series against the same team in India as he scored a half-century along with 44 in the first Test and 104* and 67* in the second match.
He won the Man of the Series award for his impressive batting performances in the two Test match series.
In October 2003, he scored 102 in the first ODI against Australia at Gwalior , sharing a 190-run second wicket partnership with Tendulkar.
However he failed to deliver on a consistent basis in ODIs.
He continued to perform well against Australia, especially during India's tour of Australia in 2003–04, in which he hit three ODI and two Test centuries.
He was involved in two century partnerships, one with Tendulkar and the other with Dravid, in the Brisbane ODI against Australia where he remained unbeaten on 102.
His 106* against the same opponents at Sydney saw him put up a fourth-wicket partnership of 213 runs with Yuvraj Singh , who scored his career-best 139.
In the next ODI against Zimbabwe, Laxman scored a 138-ball 131, once again setting up 2 hundred-run stands.
He scored 148 in the famous Adelaide Test, sharing a triple century partnership with Rahul Dravid , which India won by 4 wickets.
This was their first Test victory in Australia in two decades.
His innings of 178 at Sydney also came in a triple century partnership, on this occasion with Sachin Tendulkar .
India went on to post 705/7 in their first innings which is their highest total in Test cricket.
Laxman scored a total of 494 runs from the 4 Tests at a staggering average of 82.
During this series, Ian Chappell described Laxman as Very Very Special Laxman.
His 107  against Pakistan in the fifth and the final ODI at Lahore , helped India win by 40 runs and clinch the series 3–2.Decline of form However, Laxman's form was on the decline since the series against Australia.
Beginning with the series in Pakistan in 2004, Laxman had only Test centuries to his credit, with one coming against a weak Zimbabwe side.
He averaged just 31 in the Test series in Pakistan in 3 matches.
His only half-century  in the last match at Ahmedabad .
Laxman was dropped after scoring a duck in the first Test against England at Nagpur in March 2006.
He regained his place for the tour of the West Indies in place of the injured Tendulkar, and made a hundred in the third Test.
He also scored a resilient 63 in the second innings to deny West Indies the victory in the same match.
In ODIs, Laxman was left out persistently since Greg Chappell took over as coach in mid-2005, mainly on account of his slow ground fielding and running between the wickets; Laxman is a highly regarded close-catching fielder in stationary positions but in ODIs, these positions are generally disused except for the opening phases of the match, and players otherwise have to patrol substantial spaces and retrieve balls.
Another reason was a perception that his batting is too one paced for ODI cricket and that he lacks the ability to score at a high rate as required when the batting team has the momentum, or in the closing stages of the innings.
This was despite his superb form in Australia and Pakistan in early 2004, when he made four centuries in 14 games, including three in a week in the VB Series in Australia.In December 2005, Laxman helped India to victory against Sri Lanka with a fine century.
In June 2006, Laxman again rescued India from a difficult position against the West Indies with a gritty century.
In November 2006, he was selected in the test squad for India's tour of South Africa.
In the first test in Johannesburg Laxman scored 73 in the second innings to help India claim a historic 123 run win.
In the 2007 tour of England Laxman produced three good innings, two of which were half-centuries and a vital 39 that helped India draw the first test at Lords.
He passed the 5000 run landmark in the first day of the final test.After the tests he joined Lancashire as their overseas player in place of Brad Hodge .
He played in five games of the county championship and showed glimpses of his sublime batting.
In their final County Championship game of 2007, against Surrey at the Oval, Laxman scored a century in the second innings which Lancashire were chasing 489 to win.
They just missed out by 25 runs and subsequently lost the Championship to Sussex.
His performance for Lancashire was good with 380 runs scored in 5 matches at an average of 54.28 with 2 centuries and 2 half-centuries In India's home series against Pakistan in 2007, V.V.S. Laxman once again showed his importance to the team with a disciplined batting performance in the 1st Test at Delhi , as he scored 72* in dire circumstances.
This ensured his place on the tour of Australia which would be his third to that country.Sublime form from end of 2007 till May 2011Laxman's good form continued in the 2007/08 Test series against Australia with him scoring 109 against Australia on the second day of the controversial Sydney Test to put India back into the contest.
It was his 12th hundred in Test matches, and his 5th against Australia.
It was also his third consecutive century at SCG , giving him an average well above 90 at the venue.
He followed this up with a gritty knock of 79 in Perth , assisted by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and RP Singh , which set India up to record a historic and unexpected victory at a ground on which previously no Asian team had won.
He hit 51 in the first innings of the final Test at Adelaide.
He finished as the second highest run-getter for India in that series, only behind Sachin Tendulkar .He, like all other Indian batsmen, struggled in Sri Lanka against the spin duo of Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis later in July–August that year.
India lost the first Test by an innings and 239 runs at Colombo , where Laxman's first innings score of 50 was the only half-century scored by an Indian batsman in either innings.
Laxman scored another fifty in that series, in the third Test, an unbeaten 61 as India went on to lose the game by 8 wickets and the series 2–1.
Laxman was dismissed by Mendis on all five occasions in that series.
He also crossed the 6000-run milestone during the series.Laxman was supposed to replace Adam Voges for Nottinghamshire , but this move was vetoed by the BCCI due to the fact that there are players from the rival Indian Cricket League playing for Nottinghamshire.Against Australia, in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy later that year, Laxman was in top form as he scored 381 runs from 4 Tests with a double-hundred and two fifties.
During the third Test at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi, Laxman scored an unbeaten 200 in the first innings with characteristic use of his wrists and flicks through the leg side.
In the same innings, Gautam Gambhir scored 206, Laxman and Gambhir becoming the first pair of batsmen to score double-centuries in the same innings for India, and the first to do so against Australia.
This was his second double-century in Test cricket with the previous one coming against the same opponents.
He made an unbeaten 59 in the second innings and was named Man of the Match.
The match was also the last game of India's spin wizard Anil Kumble who was also the captain of the team.
In the final Test at Nagpur , Laxman scored another half-century in the first innings of the match.In 2009, Laxman continued to be in brilliant form.
He had scored 76 and 124* in the 2nd Test at Napier in New Zealand.
The century helped India salvage a draw and avoid an innings defeat.
In the next match at Wellington he hit a well-composed 61 in the second innings.
Against Sri Lanka later that year in a home series, Laxman hit three fifties in four innings as India went on to win the series comfortably.
His unbeaten 51 in the second innings combining with a hundred from Tendulkar helped India draw the first Test at Ahmedabad .
Laxman scored two fifties in the next two games as India went on to win both matches by an innings.He injured himself during the first match of the two-match Test series in Bangladesh in January 2010 after scoring another unbeaten half-century.
The injury forced him to sit out for three weeks and he returned to action only during the final Test against South Africa held in Kolkata .
He scored 143* in a record stand for the seventh wicket with MS Dhoni .
The test was eventually won by India by an innings and 57 runs in the last 10 minutes of the fifth day's play, despite centuries in both innings from South African batsman Hashim Amla .
This victory also helped India draw the Test series and remain the world Number 1 team.
He also passed 7000 Test runs during the innings.Laxman helped India to level the series with Sri Lanka in August 2010 when he hit 103 not out in the run-chase, resulting in a five-wicket win in the Third Test, after scoring 69 in the first innings.
He was awarded the Man of the Match for this brilliant effort.
He scored a total of 279 runs in that series at an average of 70.
In October, he once again turned around another match that appeared headed for a comfortable Australian victory, in the first Test in Mohali.
Laxman was suffering with a back problem and needed Suresh Raina as his runner, and the Indians had collapsed to 124/8 in pursuit of 216.
He and paceman Ishant Sharma put on 81 to take the score to 205 before Sharma fell.
Last man Pragyan Ojha then managed to survive till the end as the hosts completed a thrilling one-wicket win.
Laxman ended on 73 not out.
He was ruled out of the remaining matches of the series due to his injury.
In November, he helped India recover from 15/5 in the second innings of the first Test against New Zealand at Ahmedabad and the match was drawn.
In the second match of the series at his home ground Hyderabad , he scored 74 and the match ended in another draw.After dismal batting in the first Test of the South African tour, Laxman once again helped India to a historic win at Durban .
India struggled to cope with Dale Steyn in the first innings before getting bundled out for 205.
Laxman's 38 was the highest score in that innings.
In the second innings, India were struggling at 94/5 and he put on crucial partnerships with Dhoni and Zaheer Khan to help his team to 228, giving South Africa a target of 303.
South Africa were bundled out for 215 giving India an 87-run win that helped level the series 1–1.
He was awarded the Man of the Match for his match-winning innings of 96.In three test matches, Laxman scored three consecutive fifties including two scores in eighties against the West Indies during India's tour of West Indies in June 2011.June 2011 to RetirementDuring India's Tour to England, Laxman scored just two half-centuries in eight innings as India went down 0–4 to England.
This was India's first Test series loss since the 2007/08 India Tour of Australia.
Laxman got out with the pull shot frequently in this series, which otherwise he is good at.
As part of West Indies tour to India in September 2011, Laxman scored a magnificent 176 not out in the second test, but India had to settle for a draw.
Laxman was adjudged Man of the match.
India went on to win the series 1–0.
Laxman again failed to live to his expectations during India's tour of Australia in November 2011, as India went down 0–4 to Australia with Laxman scoring only two half centuries in eight innings.
For the first time in four tours to Australia, Laxman failed to register a century in the series; and also for the first time in four test matches played at Sydney Cricket Ground he failed to touch the three figure mark.
Post this series, there were calls from the media and former Cricketers that it was time for the seniors like Laxman, Dravid and Sachin to take a call on their international career.Laxman was originally named as the Icon Player for his home franchise Deccan Chargers before the first season of IPL.
But he gave up the Icon Player status in a bid to allow his team spend a bigger purse at the auction.
The Deccan Chargers bought him at the auction for $375,000 and named him the captain for the first season.
However, Laxman dropped himself from the team halfway through the season, after the team had a horrendous in the tournament.
Adam Gilchrist took over as the captain and led the side in the next two seasons as well.
Although, Laxman did scored 155 runs from the 6 games that he played at an average of 31 and strike rate of 118.
He batted at 3 in the first few games before opening the innings with Gilchrist in some matches where he found more success.
His only half-century of the tournament  came against Royal Challengers Bangalore .
He did score a couple more of fluent innings that season including the unbeaten 37 from 26 balls against the Mumbai Indians and 48 from 34 balls against Kings XI Punjab .
However, he struggled with the bat in the next two seasons and sat out of the tournament after playing only 5–6 matches.At the mega-auction in 2011, Laxman was bought by the newly formed franchise of Kochi Tuskers Kerala for $400,000.
This time, though, he was injured after the first three games and missed the rest of the season.
In the first match against Royal Challengers, he opened the innings with Brendon McCullum and scored an attractive 36 from 29 deliveries.
But, the Kochi franchise was terminated later that year and all the players of the team were put in the auction in 2012.
However, Laxman, who had a base price of $400,000, found no buyers and he couldn't participate in the 2012 edition of the tournament.Then in IPL 2013, he was appointed as a mentor for Sunrisers Hyderabad Team.On 18 August 2012, Laxman announced his retirement from international cricket.
Although he was selected for the upcoming New Zealand series, he opted not to play in the series but he will play in domestic cricket for Hyderabad and the Indian Premier League .
Wisden Cricketer of the Year : 2002.He is one of the few cricketers to score the most number of centuries  in a single ODI series.
His innings of 281 against Australia at Kolkata in 2001 was ranked sixth in Wisden 's list of 100 great Test innings in the history of the game.He has the record of taking the most number of catches  by a non-wicketkeeper in an single ODI series.
He shares this record with Allan Border .
He along with Rahul Dravid share the world record for the highest partnership in 3rd innings of a test match for any wicket during a winning cause.
Laxman is one of the six Indian test players in history to score 100 runs in a single session of a test match.
Laxman is the second Indian player to score 1000 or more runs at a single ground.
He scored 1217 runs at an average of 110.63 at Eden gardens.

He does not have any wickets to show even in the Ranji trophy, how do we expect him to succeed at the highest level.
The 4 for 40 being talked about comprised mainly of lower order wickets.
He should have bowled a couple of seasons in Ranji and shown consistent performances to be selected in the Indian team.

Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , a non-profit organization.Kevin Peter Pietersen MBE  is a South African-born English cricketer .
He is a right-handed batsman and occasional off spin bowler who formerly played for England and currently plays for Surrey as well as Twenty20 , in the Caribbean Premier League for St Lucia Zouks and in the Big Bash League for Melbourne Stars .Pietersen was born in Pietermaritzburg , Natal Province , South Africa.
He made his first-class debut for Natal in 1997 before moving to England, after voicing his displeasure at the racial quota system in place in South Africa.
The England team's subsequent reliance on Pietersen resulted in only a single first-class appearance for Hampshire between 2005 and 2010.
On 17 June 2010, Pietersen announced his wish to leave Hampshire He was captain of the England Test and ODI teams from 4 August 2008 to 7 January 2009 but resigned after just three Tests and nine ODIs, following a dispute with England coach Peter Moores , who was sacked the same day.
Pietersen became the fastest batsman to reach both 1,000 and 2,000 runs in One Day International cricket Pietersen last played for England in the 2013-14 Ashes and subsequent ODIs , after which he was informed that he was no longer being considered for international selection.Early and personal lifePietersen was born to an English mother, Penny, and an Afrikaner father, Jannie.
Pietersen attended Maritzburg College , Pietermaritzburg , and made his first-class cricket debut for Natal 's B team in 1997, aged 17, where he was regarded predominantly as an off spin bowler and a hard-hitting lower-order batsman.
Having seen Pietersen play at a school cricket festival, Clive Rice invited him to sign for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club .
Pietersen accepted without hesitation, keen to make the most of top-class cricket under a coach for whom he had the utmost admiration.
He did not at this stage contemplate forsaking his nation; nor had it yet occurred to him that the decision would eventually have to be taken.
Pietersen is widely portrayed in the media as having a self-assured personality, described by Geoffrey Boycott as being "cocky and confident".
Kevin Pietersen published his autobiography: Kevin Pietersen: Crossing the Boundary in early 2007.
A second biography: Kevin Pietersen: Portrait of a Rebel written by journalist Marcus Stead, was published in the autumn of 2009.
This book includes a detailed account of the controversies of Pietersen's reign as England captain.
A revised and updated version of Stead's book, now titled 'KP – The Biography' which brought his story up-to-date, was published in July 2013.Pietersen is married to Liberty X singer Jessica Taylor .
Jessica gave birth to the couple's first child, a son Dylan, on 11 May 2010.
Pietersen made a dash back across the Atlantic, from where he was on tour with the England side, in Barbados, West Indies, in a bid to be present at the birth.
He arrived at the hospital just in time for the birth.
On the arrival of his son, Pietersen said "This really is the most amazing experience of my life."
". . .
a young off-spinning opponent of ours walked into the England dressing room after taking a few wickets for KwaZulu Natal in a tour match in Durban and plonked himself down next to me, asking if I knew of any English teams he could play for.
I thought he meant club cricket and almost gave him my brother's number and told him to try Fives and Heronians but it turned out he had bigger ambitions than that..." —  Nasser Hussain on Kevin Pietersen, Mail OnlineHe impressed members of Nasser Hussain 's England side when playing for KwaZulu Natal in 1999; he took four top-order wickets and, despite batting at number nine, scored 61 not out from 57 balls, hitting four sixes.
Despite the praise from the England side, Pietersen claimed he was dropped from the Natal first team.
Pietersen felt that this was due to the country's racial quota system, in which provincial sides were required to have at least four black players.
In 2000, Nottinghamshire coach Clive Rice , who had seen Pietersen play in 1997 in South Africa at a schools week, heard that Pietersen was playing club cricket for the Cannock Cricket Club and offered him a three-year contract to play for the county.
In 2003, Pietersen scored 1,546 first-class runs, and 764 runs in limited overs cricket .
After Nottinghamshire were relegated in 2003, Pietersen requested a release from his contract, saying "I haven't been happy for a while....The pitch at Trent Bridge has been one of my problems...
I could have done so much better if the wicket had been good."
This led to a public row with club captain Jason Gallian , where Gallian allegedly threw Pietersen's kit off the Trent Bridge balcony and broke his bat:During the game I told the captain that I was not happy and that I wanted to leave.
After the game we spoke in the dressing room and then I went to have dinner.
I got a call saying the captain had trashed my equipment.
I was told the captain had said, 'if he does not want to play for Notts he can f*** off.'
I have not spoken to Gallian since, nor have I received an apology.
Pietersen was made to honour the last year of his contract at Nottinghamshire, but "didn't enjoy it at all".
After becoming a regular in the national side, Pietersen rarely got an opportunity to play domestic cricket.
Having an England "central contract" meant that Pietersen was only released to play for Hampshire at the discretion of the national coach.
After being left out of the national side to face Bangladesh in May 2005, Pietersen had several good innings in the English County Championship , including two centuries.
Pietersen then joined Surrey on loan from Hampshire for the remainder of the 2010 English county cricket season.
In February 2014, Delhi Daredevils of Indian Premier League bought Pietersen for USD 1.5 Million for the 2014 Indian Premier League season,  Pietersen had previously played for the Delhi Daredvils during the 2012 Indian Premier League Season.In July 2014, he played for the Rest of the World side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's .

Pietersen is eligible to play for England as he has an English mother.

The tour of Zimbabwe caused several players to voice their concerns about the Robert Mugabe regime, the security issues in the country and the standard of the Zimbabwean side.
In the five match ODI series, Pietersen batted in three innings which included a score of 77 not out; he finished the series with an average of 104.00 as England won the series 4–0.Success in South AfricaPietersen was upset not to be initially in the squad to tour South Africa.
He said:I knew I was going to cop a lot of stick but it will be like water off a duck's back...I expected stick at the start of the innings, and I'm sure it will carry on through the whole series.
But I just sat back and laughed at the opposition, with their swearing and 'traitor' remarks... some of them can hardly speak English.
My affiliation is with England.
In fact, I'm starting to speak too much like Darren Gough ... In fact, I'm going to get one of Gough's tattoos with three lions and my number underneath...No one can say I'm not English.
Pietersen scored a 96-ball 108 not out in the tied second ODI at Bloemfontein , after which the crowd turned their backs on him as he returned to the pavilion.

England in Australia, 2006–07See also: 2006-07 Ashes series and English cricket team in Australia in 2006–07In the much-anticipated Ashes series in Australia, Pietersen was hyped up as England's best player and this was justified as he scored 490 runs in five matches and averaged over fifty, despite Australia's obvious targeting of him.
"I was interested to see how he would get on in Australia in 2006–07 on pitches with more bounce", wrote Warne, "because bowlers had tried to test him with the short ball.
He was still England's best batsman."
He started well, in the First Test.
Despite a failure of 16 in the first test, he produced a fine spell of batting with a good 92 in the second innings.

See also: English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2007–08Pietersen scored 50 in England's opening game in Sri Lanka against the Sri Lankan Cricket XI, See also: English cricket team in New Zealand in 2007–08 and New Zealand cricket team in England in 2008On England's tour against New Zealand , Pietersen averaged 33.00 in the ODI series, with one score of 50 in the tied fourth match; England lost the series 3–1.

Pietersen hit a winning 42 not out in the Twenty20 match.In the first ODI of the NatWest series, Pietersen hit two sixes by "switch-hitting" en route to 110 not out.
While facing the bowling of medium pace Scott Styris , Pietersen turned his body around and switched hands , but changed his stance by rotating his body, these "switch-hit" shots were immediately followed by calls to outlaw them from the game.
Several commentators complained that because Pietersen changed from being a right-handed to a left-handed batsman as the bowler approached his delivery stride, he was gaining an unfair advantage.
Gideon Haigh said that "A bowler must advise a batsman when he's changing direction, why should the batsmen not; given that where the bowler's aiming will depend on the placement of the off stump".
Ian Healy seconded this by saying "It just should be outlawed straightaway.
If you want to hit to one side of the field, you've got to do it in a cross fashion, and not swap the way you're facing or your grip.
Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups."
Former fast-bowler Michael Holding argued "if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should he have to tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket."
"That's ridiculous, absolutely stupid.
The reverse-sweep has been part of the game for however long.
I am just fortunate that I am able to hit it a bit further.
Everybody wants brand new ideas, new inventions and new shots.
That is a new shot played today and people should be saying it's a new way to go.
There are new things happening for cricket at the moment and people shouldn't be criticising it all the time."
Another citation for the shot being outlawed was that the possibility of being out LBW  is removed, as the off side become the leg side and vice versa.
There are still calls for further review of the stroke, with Jonathan Agnew giving a scenario in which a right-handed batsman can take his stance as a left-hander, then switch stance as the bowler runs in, thus being able to kick away any balls that land outside his now off stump.
He also calls for the wide law to be adjusted in one-day cricket, as bowlers are penalised for most deliveries that pass down the leg side.
Pietersen captained England in the fifth ODI against New Zealand after Paul Collingwood was banned for four games for a slow over-rate during the previous match.
New Zealand won to finish theetersen was named as the stand-in captain for three further matches in August.

Jonathan Agnew and Alec Stewart called the stroke "irresponsible" and Agnew continued, suggesting that Pietersen therefore ruled himself out of the potential reckoning for the England captaincy with Vaughan 's place in the starting line-up in doubt after failing to score runs.
Following the news that he had been made England Test and ODI captain, Pietersen paid tribute to both outgoing captains but announced that he would look to captain the team in his own style.

Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , a non-profit organization.Ricky Thomas Ponting, AO , nicknamed Punter, is an Australian former cricketer who was captain of the Australia national cricket team during its 'golden era'; between 2004 and 2011 in Test cricket and 2002 and 2011 in One Day International cricket.
He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.
He is a specialist right-handed batsman , slips and close catching fielder, as well as a very occasional bowler .
He is the only Australian test captain to have led his side to three separate Ashes series defeats, but led Australia to victory at the 2003 and 2007 cricket world cups and was also a member of the 1999 world cup winning team under Steve Waugh .He represented the Tasmanian Tigers in Australian domestic cricket , the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League, and played in the Indian Premier League with the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2008.
He is widely considered by many to be one of the best batsmen of the modern era, along with Sachin Tendulkar of India and Brian Lara of the West Indies.
On 1 December 2006, he reached the highest rating achieved by a Test batsman in the last 50 years.Ponting made his first-class debut for Tasmania in November 1992, when just 17 years and 337 days old, becoming the youngest Tasmanian to play in a Sheffield Shield match.
However, he had to wait until 1995 before making his One Day International  debut, during a quadrangular tournament in New Zealand in a match against South Africa .
His Test debut followed shortly after, when selected for the first Test of the 1995 home series against Sri Lanka in Perth, in which he scored 96.
He lost his place in the national team several times in the period before early-1999, due to lack of form and discipline, before becoming One Day International captain in early-2002 and Test captain in early-2004.After being involved in over 160 Tests and 370 ODIs, Ponting is Australia's leading run-scorer in Test and ODI cricket.
He is one of only four players  in history to have scored 13,000 Test runs.
Statistically, he is one of the most successful captains of all time, with 48 victories in 77 Tests between 2004 and 31 December 2010.
As a player, Ricky Ponting is the only cricketer in history to be involved in 100 Test victories.
On 29 November 2012 Ponting announced his retirement from Test cricket, the day before he would play in the Perth Test against South Africa.
This was his 168th and last Test appearance, 4.1 Appointment as One Day International captain5 2004–2008: Appointment as Test captainBirth and personal lifeBorn in Launceston, Tasmania on 19 December 1974, Ricky Ponting is the eldest of Graeme and Lorraine Ponting's four children.
Graeme was "a good club cricketer" and played Australian rules football , while Lorraine was a state vigoro champion.
After marrying long-time girlfriend, law student Rianna Jennifer Cantor, in June 2002, Ponting credited her as the reason for his increased maturity.
Their daughter Emmy Charlotte was born in Sydney on 26 July 2008.
Introduced to cricket by father Graeme and uncle Greg Campbell , Australian Rules football was also a big part of Ponting's sporting life, and is a keen follower of the North Melbourne Kangaroos .
During the winter he played junior football for North Launceston and up until he was 14, it could have become a possible sporting option.
This was before he broke the humerus in his right arm playing for North Launceston Under–17s as a 13-year-old.
Ponting's arm was so badly damaged, it had to be pinned.
During Tasmanian Sheffield Shield matches at the NTCA Ground , Ponting helped out with the scoreboard, thereby surrounding himself with international cricketers.
Playing five games for Tasmania for the 1992 Under–19 carnival in Perth , Ponting scored 350 runs, earning him selection in the 13-man national Under–19 development squad for the upcoming tour of South Africa—the first Australian cricket team to make an official tour to the country since Bill Lawry 's team in 1970.
After scoring 114 not out in club match against Riverside , Ponting became the youngest player to appear for Tasmania in a Sheffield Shield match, breaking Boon's record by 14 days.
Speculation ignited that Ponting was an outsider to join the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England .
Despite Ponting's reluctance to weigh into the debate, Tasmanian coach Greg Shipperd thought he could handle the experience.
A month after the final, he was again selected for the Academy squad for three limited overs matches against a touring Indian team.
Queenslander Stuart Law captained the Australian side that included former Australian keeper Rod Marsh .
In Australia's victory in Canberra he top scored with 71 and before scoring 52 in victory in Sydney.
The last match was also successful for the home team, with Ponting not required to bat.
Ponting started his 1994–95 campaign with a century against eventual Shield champions Queensland in Brisbane, impressing Queensland captain Allan Border , "He's just an outstanding prospect", Border said.
Speculation once again arose that Ponting could become a candidate for the upcoming tour to the West Indies .
When Tasmania played Western Australia at Bellerive Oval on 4 November 1994, Ponting scored 211.
The century was his fifth successive against Western Australia- Sir Donald Bradman is the only other batsman to score five consecutive centuries against another state in Shield history.
A fourth team was introduced to the World Series Cup in 1994–95— Australia A —for the only time.
Something the Australian captain Mark Taylor was not a fan of, as many fans were supporting Australia A. Despite the negative feedback, it gave Ponting a chance on the international stage.
Ponting's domestic performances were rewarded when he was selected for the Australian ODI team to play in all the matches in the 1995 New Zealand Centenary quadrangular tournament in New Zealand, that also included South Africa and India.
Ponting made his debut against South Africa at number six in the batting order.
He scored one from six balls, as Australia successfully chased South Africa's target on a difficult batting track.
Australia secured another victory in their next match, this time against New Zealand in Auckland, where Ponting scored 10 not out, after coming to wicket late in the innings.
His highest series score came in the third International where Australia lost to India in Dunedin.
Ponting was promoted to number three in the batting order and responded by scoring 62 from 92 balls.
The innings was scored without a boundary and was based on "deft placement and judicious running."
Greg Shipperd publicly suggested that Ponting could be selected as a reserve wicket-keeper for the upcoming West Indies tour, despite not keeping-wicket for Tasmania .
However, he had kept wicket in pre-season matches and during centre wicket practice.
In any case Ponting was selected as a specialist batsman.
Ponting was selected for the third ODI on 12 March 1995 at Queen's Park Oval , when Mark Waugh missed out through injury.
Ponting—batting at three—was involved in a 59-run partnership with Steve Waugh; however, he was dismissed for 43 when he lifted an attempted pull shot.
Mark Waugh returned for the next match and Ponting was subsequently dropped until he replaced an out-of-form David Boon in the fifth and final match, where Ponting got a second-ball duck.
In a three-day warm-up match ahead of the Tests, Ponting scored 19, with Greg Blewett scoring a century and Langer compiling a half-century.
Tasmania toured Zimbabwe for five games ahead of the 1995/96 Sheffield Shield.
Ponting struggled, aggregating 99 runs at a modest 24.75.
By the end of October, he had signed a contract with the Australian Cricket Board , along with 22 other Australian cricketers.
Sri Lanka batted first and scored 251, before Ponting—batting at number five due to Steve Waugh 's absence through injury—arrived at the crease with Australia at a comfortable 3/422.
He started nervously, edging his first ball past first slip for a boundary from off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan .
When Ponting reached 96, Chaminda Vaas hit Ponting high on his thigh and was given out leg before wicket.
However, Ponting's performance was overshadowed by Australian umpire Darrell Hair no-balling Muralitharan for throwing on seven occasions, increasing tensions between the two teams.
Though Ponting's appearances for Tasmania continued to be limited, he was still able to top the 1995/96 season averages with 59.50.
A Tamil Tiger bombing in Colombo coupled with death threats to some members of the team forced Australia to forfeit their scheduled 1996 Cricket World Cup match against Sri Lanka in Colombo.
In August, Australia played in the Singer Cup in Sri Lanka, after a five-month break since the World Cup.
Despite the political environment being more assured than during the World Cup, Australia still struggled to defeat the Sri Lankans, now full of confidence.
Australia overpowered Zimbabwe, before going down the home side.
They regrouped and defeated India; however, Sri Lanka defeated Australia once again, this time in the final.
Ponting scored: 53, 46 not out, 0 and 17 for the series.
Ponting continued in the role for the series against the West Indies in 1996–97 in Australia.
After two Test matches and three scores under 10, he was replaced by Justin Langer , Ponting was selected for the 1997 Ashes tour of England, but did not play in any of the three preceding ODIs.
He was not selected for the first three Tests; England won the first, Australia the third, and the second was drawn.
Ponting was given three one-dayers and First-class match against Glamorgan to try and push his case for a Test inclusion.
He scored a century in the latter, but managed just five against Middlesex in the last match before the Fourth Test.
Michael Bevan was eventually dropped for Ponting, due to poor form and troubles against the short ball.
Ponting scored 119 runs at 39.66 in the three-Test home series against New Zealand in 1997–98, including a breezy 73 not out from 85 balls in the second innings of the First Test in Brisbane to help Australia set a winning target.
1998 tours of the subcontinent and AshesJust 10 days after their tour of New Zealand, Australia played in a first-class warm-up match in India, ahead of their three match Test series.
Sachin Tendulkar struck a double century in the opening warm-up match as the Australian bowlers struggled to cope with the conditions.
Ponting came into the Test series with first-class scores of 53, 37 and 155 behind him.
Batting at five and seven in the batting order respectively, he scored 18 in the first innings and two in the second on a "dusty turning track" in the opening Test in Chennai.
Despite conceding a 71 first innings lead, Tendulkar struck 155 in India's second innings, as India won by 169 runs.
Several days after the match, Ponting was thrown out of Equinox night club in Kolkata .
The Indian media reported that Ponting was misbehaving with several women in the nightclub.
Ponting was fined $1000 by Australian team management for the incident, and later apologised to staff.
Ponting later wrote:A few of the players wanted to go to a nightspot and so this guy had organised for us to get into a nightclub in Calcutta that was usually restricted to members and special guests.
When we arrived at the nightclub this same guy spoke to the doorman.
He explained that we were Australian cricketers and after a few minutes, they let us in.
What we didn't know was that it was a couples night which meant the only way men could get in was in the company of a female.
We were quite happy just hanging out together and having a few drinks, and for me it was a chance to celebrate North Melbourne's win in the AFL Ansett Cup final in Melbourne.
Everyone was having a good time and knocking down a few beers and the next thing I knew I was asked to leave by one of the security guys.
I am usually the last one to leave a nightclub and I wanted to stay, and there was a scuffle but that is all there was to it.
I didn't realise we were the only single guys there.
To be honest I couldn't remember half of what went on during the night because I'd had a skinful but I definitely did not assault women in the nightclub.
Thankfully I had enough witnesses to prove it.
In the following Test in Bangalore , Australia won their first Test in India for 29 years, despite 177 not out from Tendulkar, which gave India a slender first innings lead.
Ponting scored 16 his only innings as Australia won by eight wickets.
He finished the series with 105 runs at 21.00 as the hosts took the Tests 2–1.
Despite a poor Test series, Ponting's form in ODIs remained strong.
In consecutive tournaments in India and Sharjah following the Tests, Ponting scored 467 runs at 51.88.
In addition to three fifties, Ponting scored 145 from 158 balls in the Pepsi Cup against Zimbabwe in Delhi , equalling Dean Jones ' Australian record.
On the subsequent tour of Pakistan less than six months later, Ponting was dropped in favour of Darren Lehmann .
The left-hander was perceived to be a better player of spin and a better prospect on the dry pitches of the Indian subcontinent than Ponting.
In the first Test starting in October, Lehmann scored 98 in Rawalpindi , as Australia won their first Test in Pakistan in 39 years.
Ponting's only Test outing was in a high-scoring second Test draw in Peshawar , when he scored 76 not out and 43 as Lehmann was injured.
The match saw Mark Taylor equal Don Bradman 's Australian record score of 334, when he declared Australia's innings overnight on 4/599, despite being not out.
Ponting was replaced by Lehmann for the final Test.
In between the Tests and the ODIs, Australia were knocked out of the 1998 Wills International Cup, starting in late October, when they were defeated by India in their opening match.
In a knockout based tournament, Tendulkar scored 141 in India's total of 307; meanwhile, Ponting managed a 53 ball 41, in a 44 run defeat.
In a tournament hosted in Bangladesh, South Africa were eventual victors, defeating the West Indies in the final.
He finished the series with 215 runs at 107.50.When the Australians returned for the home series against England, Ponting was "in the worst run-scoring groove in his first-class career."
1999–2002: The road back to the Australian sideMark Taylor retired from international cricket on 2 February 1999, and was replaced by ODI captain Steve Waugh.
Australia started their 1999 World Cup campaign in England with success against minnows Scotland, before defeats by Pakistan and New Zealand.
He ended the tournament with 354 runs at 39.33.Australia soon travelled to Sri Lanka for a three-Test series, which they lost 1–0.
Ponting was one of Australia's few effective players during the tour and was Man-of-the-Series, ending with 253 runs at 84.33.
Ponting started the 1999–2000 season poorly, with ducks in his first three Test innings in the series against Pakistan, including a pair on his home ground Bellerive Oval .
He ended the run in style, scoring 197 in the Third Test at the WACA.
Australia won the series 3–0 Ahead of the first Test of the 2000–01 season in November, Ponting found form while playing for Tasmania.
He scored 233 against a strong Queensland bowling team that included Andy Bichel , Adam Dale and Ashley Noffke .
The innings included 37 boundaries and four sixes, and was so dominant, the next highest score for the innings was 61.
In the second and final first-class match Ponting played for Tasmania in the season, he scored a more sedate 187 against New South Wales in Hobart, assuring him a place in the Test side, despite Damien Martyn  scoring two centuries for Western Australia.
Ponting was overlooked the ODI vice-captaincy, with Gilchrist given the role; however, Ponting captained a Northern Territory XI against the West Indies in the lead-up to the upcoming series.
Defeat in India and 2001 AshesInjury aside , his position was now secure.
Australia toured India in between February and April for three Tests and five ODIs.
Australia had not won a Test series in India since 1969.
He was dismissed all five times by Harbhajan.
Ponting had a habit of instinctively rocking onto the front foot and thrusting his wrists at Harbhajan's deliveries and was frequently caught in the bat pad positions because of this.Despite this recent run of poor scores, Ponting was promoted to the key No. 3 position in the Australian batting order at the expense of the dropped Justin Langer , while Damien Martyn took Ponting's former spot at No. 6, for the very next Test series, the 2001 Ashes tour of England.
Ponting began the series poorly, scoring 11, The touring New Zealanders were not expected to provide much of a challenge to the in-form Australians during the three-match Test series starting in November.
The opening Test in Brisbane, saw the tourists came within 11 runs of victory, before the Test was drawn; partly to do with inclement weather.
Ponting scored five and a run-a-ball 32 not out in Australia's second innings, as they pushed for a declaration.
After scoring 4, 0 and 0 in his previous Test outings at Bellerive Oval , Ponting broke through with a man-of-the-match performance of 157 not out in the Second Test, before further rain resulted in another draw.
The result of the Third Test in Perth was no different, with Ponting scoring 31 and 26.

Appointment as One Day International captainRicky Ponting at a training session at the Adelaide Oval in 2009.Although the Test team had continued to perform well, sweeping South Africa 3–0 in the home series in 2001–02, the One-Day International  team suffered a slump, failing to qualify for the finals of the triangular tournament , leading to the dropping of Steve Waugh from the one-day team in February 2002.

Lehmann was handed a seven-match ban for racial abuse, the world's number 1 ranked ODI batsman Michael Bevan was injured, as was all rounder Shane Watson , who had to withdraw from the World Cup.
At the time, another all-rounder, Andrew Symonds , had been performing poorly and had been heavily maligned by cricket analysts, but Ponting strongly advocated his inclusion.
The selectors granted Ponting his wish, although the decision was considered highly controversial, especially with Waugh campaigning for his recall as an all-rounder.A few days before the tournament started, Australia were in further turmoil, when leading bowler Shane Warne was sent home after failing a drugs test, and a replacement could not be flown in until after the first match.
With Bevan and Lehmann still sidelined, Australia went into their opening match with little choice over their line-up, and Symonds having to play.
However, Symonds repaid Ponting's faith with an unbeaten 140 after Australia lost three quick wickets to be in early trouble.
Australia beat Pakistan, and gained further momentum by defeating India by nine wickets in less than half their allotted overs in the next match.
Symonds continued to put in a series of match-winning performances and continued to be strongly backed by Ponting from then on.
Ponting himself performed solidly with 53 against Pakistan and 24 not out, hitting the winning runs to guide Australia home.He failed to perform in the rest of the group matches including just 2 against Namibia and 18 against England in a poor performance which Australia managed to win just.
He began the Super Six stage with a massive 114 against Sri Lanka.

Since 1997 the Australian team has not always had the same captain for Tests and for ODIs, with Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh being dropped from the ODI team whilst still the Test captain.2004–2008:
Appointment as Test captainMain articles: 2004 ICC Champions Trophy , New Zealand cricket team in Australia in 2004–05 and Pakistani cricket team in Australia in 2004–05Ricky Ponting was destined to lead his country – I couldn't have handed Australian cricket's ultimate individual honour to a more capable and deserving man.
A leader must earn respect and lead from the front, and on both of these counts Punter has undoubtedly excelled.
When the one-day leadership duties were passed over to Ricky in South Africa, my main piece of advice to him was, 'Make sure you take care of your own game and maintain your form, because everything else will follow from that.' Since assuming the mantle, Punter has shown himself to be among the top three batsmen in the world in both forms of the game, and has elevated his hunger and desire for runs to a level most can only aspire to.—
Steve Waugh writing about Ponting replacing him as Australian captain After Steve Waugh 's  retirement at the beginning of 2004 following the drawn home series against India, Ponting assumed the Test captaincy.Ponting started with a 3–0 clean sweep of the Test series in Sri Lanka.
Ponting brought Symonds into the Test team on the back of strong ODI form, rather than first-class cricket, replacing Simon Katich , who had scored a century and unbeaten fifty in the last Test.
However, this backfired and Symonds was dropped after two Tests.
Nevertheless, it was a far cry from Australia's last two Test campaigns in Sri Lanka, which had resulted in a 1–0 and 0–1 results respectively.
Individually though, Ponting struggled, especially in comparison to his efforts in 1999.
He scored 198 runs at 33.00, his only effort beyond 30 being 92 in the first innings of the Third Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo.

By this time, Australia had taken an unassailable 2–0 series lead, his deputy Gilchrist leading the tourists to their first Test series win in India since 1969–70.
Leading spinner Shane Warne injured himself on the eve of the match, which was played on a very dry pitch at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai .
Off spinner Nathan Hauritz and leg spinner Cameron White , who were not regular wicket-takers in domestic cricket, were surprise selections ahead of Stuart MacGill for the tour.
The reasoning given by the selectors was that as they intended to play only one spinner—Warne—MacGill was unlikely to play so they would not lose anything by taking some young spinners instead, in order to gain experience.
However, it was too late for MacGill to be flown in, and Hauritz played and took 5/103.
Ponting made 11 and 12 and Australia lost a low-scoring match in less than two days' equivalent playing time.

Thus, the Ashes were lost for the first time in 16 years.The setback to Australia, and to Ponting as Australian captain, of the 2005 Ashes defeat, was to prove a strong motivation for the Australian camp to improve their standards and overcome any complacency that may have arisen from Australia's being the world's premier cricketing nation for a decade.
Prior to the Ashes defeat, Australia's dominance had prompted the ICC to organise a series against a World XI, immediately after the Ashes.
Following the Ashes defeat, Australia were expected to struggle against the World XI, but bounced back to whitewash them 3–0 in the ODIs; they also won the only Test easily, Ponting scoring 46 and 54.
However, the series was also criticised due to the apparent lack of collective desire of the World XI, who were regarded more as a collection of individuals.Twin centuries in 100th TestMain articles: 2005–06 Chappell–Hadlee Trophy and South African cricket team in Australia in 2005–06In any case, Australia were untroubled during the 2005–06 season.

This was ruled by the MCC to have contravened Law 6.1, which states that bats have to be made of wood, although they may be "covered with material for protection, strengthening or repair not likely to cause unacceptable damage to the ball".
Ponting and Kookaburra agreed to comply, before the series against South Africa.

The issue, while minor, was solved when Ponting issued a formal apology to Pawar.

The pair had taken more than 1250 Test wickets between them, and the only three Test defeats that Australia had suffered under Ponting, once against India in Mumbai in 2004 and the two against England in 2005, had all occurred when one of the two were injured.
Now that both had gone, critics wondered whether Australia and Ponting could maintain their success with their two main strike weapons absent.
Australia had not played a Test since the Ashes, while being involved in 32 ODIs and eight Twenty20 Internationals.
However, the series against India was much harder-fought.
Australia won the First Test easily, by 337 runs, but the matches thereafter were more difficult.
The Second Test was closely fought and ended in Australian victory minutes before the end of play.

Harbhajan missed the Third Test and upon his return in the fourth Test, Ponting broke through for his first Test century against India in matches involving Harbhajan, scoring 140.
However, the second half of the series was less successful for Australia as a team; India won the Third Test, ending the Australian streak, and the Fourth Test was a high-scoring draw.

He acknowledged that he was keen to rectify his poor Test batting record in India.
In the First Test on a turning pitch in Bangalore, In the Second Test in Mohali.
Australia were defeated by 320 runs and Ponting was criticised for using part-timer bowlers against the free-scoring Indian batsmen in the second innings, because of a slow over-rate, which is can be penalised by a fine, or in severe instances, a ban to the captain.
This meant that he was not able to use pace spearhead Brett Lee significantly.The Third Test in Delhi saw a flat pitch, where India scored 7/613 in its first innings in which Ponting resorted to bowling himself for two overs.
Ponting amassed 87 in Australia's first innings score of 577.
The match ended in a draw and Australia needed to win in the Fourth Test in Nagpur to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
However, the Australians were a long way behind on their over rate , so in order to avoid a one match suspension, Ponting chose to bowl their part-time spinners and medium pacers such as Michael Clarke , Cameron White and Mike Hussey , as they took less time.
In the meantime, captain MS Dhoni and Harbhajan both added half centuries.
This drew strong criticism from many commentators , who suggested that their Faster bowlers , who had been responsible for the collapse, could have bowled from a shorter run-up.
When the fast bowlers were reintroduced, the last four wickets fell quickly.
This left Australia chasing 382 runs for victory and they lost by 172 runs to cede the series 2–0.
In the first innings, Ponting became Harbhajan's 300th Test wicket and the Australian captain ended the series with 264 runs at 37.71.
While below his career standards, it was substantially better than his previous Test efforts in India.Fined in India for a slow over rate, Ponting failed to redress the matter during the subsequent home series against New Zealand , when match referee Chris Broad dealt a second successive fine for being three overs behind in the First Test: Ponting was stripped of thirty per cent of his A$12,750 match fee, twice the punishment of his team-mates in accordance with International Cricket Council rules for captains.

His persistent problems with the over rate prompted some commentators to criticise him for spending too much time during the match conferring with bowlers.
In the first innings he scored a duck, and managed 32 in Australia's second innings.
Ponting's inexperienced attack had trouble dismissing the opposition batsmen, and South Africa made 4/414, the second highest successful runchase in history to win by six wickets on the final day.
Ponting experienced a form slump for much of 2008, albeit in comparison to his usually high standards.
However, he again exceeded 1,000 runs in the calendar year.
Ponting scored his 37th century in the first innings of the Second Test against South Africa on Boxing Day, and followed that with 99 in the second innings, seemingly a lone stand against the South African bowling attack.
Australia lost the series 2–1, the first time South Africa had won a Test series against Australian since 1970, and the first on Australian soil.
Ponting totalled 285 runs at 47.50 for the series.With the retirement of experienced opening batsman Matthew Hayden—who was replaced by the uncapped 20-year-old Phillip Hughes —the Australian team that toured South Africa in February, March and April 2009 was its most inexperienced since the defections to World Series Cricket .
This was further compounded by the loss of Andrew Symonds to injury, who was replaced by the uncapped Marcus North .
The bowling attack also required major changes, due to the injuries to Brett Lee and Stuart Clark .
Subsequently, paceman Mitchell Johnson was the only bowler with more than four Tests heading into the series.
Of the First Test team, Hughes, North, Ben Hilfenhaus , Peter Siddle and Andrew McDonald had only five Tests between them, with the former three making their debut.
Ponting's team took the series 2–1, so Australia maintained their No. 1 Test ranking.

They opened their campaign in early June against a West Indian outfit that had recently been whitewashed 2–0 in the Test series against England.
However, Ponting made a second ball duck in Australia's seven wicket defeat.
In Australia's two drawn warm-up matches ahead of the 2009 Ashes , Ponting struggled to adjust to the English conditions, somewhat, with a highest score of 71.
Ponting could only manage two and 38, as Australia were defeated in the second Test at Lords —their first Test defeat at the venue since 1934.
On 31 July, during the Third Test at Edgbaston , Ponting became the highest Australian run-scorer in the history of Test cricket, overtaking former Australian captain Allan Border 's total of 11,174 in his first-innings score of 38.
The match was eventually drawn, partly due to poor weather....
It takes three ingredients to make a great player – determination, courage and skill – and he's got all three in abundance.
He's also developed into a great leader.
Players really enjoy playing for him and that's sometimes a difficult trait to bring out in people.
You can tell by the way the team respond to him that his leadership skills are among the finest.
Combine this with his batting skill and that's a pretty intimidating package.Australia went onto lose the series 2–1 and Ponting became only the third Australian captain to lose the Ashes twice.
Despite not being a selector, Ponting was heavily criticised for Australia not playing Hauritz and his apparent reluctance to put faith in his spinners.
He was questioned, particularly on Australia's recent habit of often not playing a specialist/regular spinner.
Instances of these were the first three Tests in India, the omission of Krejza for the First Test against New Zealand immediately after taking 12 wickets on debut, and opting for no spinner in the first two Tests in South Africa.
On 7 September 2009, Ponting announced his retirement from Twenty20 international cricket in order to prolong his career.

Australia were dismissed for 127, and Ponting was once again dismissed from a short ball, this time for a first-ball duck, and many sections of the media called for him to stop playing the hook and pull shots.
He fell for only 11 in the second innings, and when Australia lost their eighth wicket, they were only just over 50 ahead.
However, a 123-run ninth-wicket partnership between Michael Hussey and Peter Siddle rescued the home-side, helping them win by 36 runs.
After being dropped on zero, Ponting scored his fifth double-century in the Third and final Test in Hobart.
His innings helped Australia complete a 3–0 series victory.In the following five ODIs, Ponting could not continue his Hobart form, scoring 125 runs at 25 in the series, boosted by a half-century in the final match.
Though, his performances improved in the five ODIs starting soon after against the West Indies.
He was named man-of-the-series thanks to his 295 runs at 73.75, including two-half centuries and his 29th and first ODI century in Brisbane during the fourth match.Australia entered the 2010–11 Ashes series hoping to regain The Ashes from England on home soil as they had four years previously.
The First Test in Brisbane was drawn after both sides posted large batting totals.
Ponting was caught behind for 10 in the first innings and 51 not out in the second.
2011 World Cup and resignation as captainPonting retained the captaincy of Australia for the 2011 World Cup in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
Australia had won the previous three World Cups and entered the tournament as the world's top-ranked ODI team.
Australia qualified for the quarter-finals, although Ponting failed to find form, scoring 102 runs in five innings during the group stage of the tournament.
In 2011, Ponting was inducted into Australian Institute of Sport  'Best of the Best'.
In the 2011–12 Australian summer, a disappointing series draw with New Zealand gave rise to calls for Ponting to be removed from the team following perceived underperformances.
The selectors resisted the calls, selecting Ponting for the Boxing Day Test —the first of a four-Test series against India.
On Australia Day 2012 he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia for services to cricket and, through the Ponting Foundation, the community.
On 29 November 2012 Ponting announced that he would retire from Test cricket after the WACA test against South Africa.
2013: Tasmania and SurreyAfter retiring from test cricket, Ponting played out the Sheffield Shield season with eventual champions Tasmania .
He was the competition's leading run scorer with 911 runs at an average of 75.91.
He signed on to play for the English County side Surrey during June–July 2013.
During the Ashes 2013 , Ponting wrote a regular column for the Daily Mail .
At the formal opening of the Bellerive Oval redevelopment in January 2015, it was announced that the new Western Stand would be named the Ricky Ponting Stand in his honour.
Approach to cricketPonting is an aggressive competitor, as manifested in his on-field conduct.
According to former Australian captain Allan Border, what you see with Ponting is what you get, and "he wears his heart on his sleeve".
Border also noted that Ponting has an abundance of determination, courage and skill.However, his competitive attitudes can be overly aggressive, pushing the boundaries of cricket etiquette.
Ricky Ponting is widely regarded as one of the greatest competitors the game has ever seen and this was testified by the South African captain, Graeme Smith, describing Ricky Ponting as the toughest competitor he had ever played against Main article: List of international cricket centuries by Ricky PontingPonting is an aggressive right-handed batsman known for playing a wide repertoire of shots with confidence, most notably his pulling and hooking.
However, he is sometimes technically questioned for shuffling across his stumps and being trapped leg before wicket, and thrusting his bat away from his body—especially early in his innings.
Despite being widely renowned as the best player of the hook and pull shots in the world, Ponting is equally adept on both the front and back foot.
Nevertheless, during the latter stages of his career, the hook and pull shots have often been the cause of his dismissal; though, he has vowed to continue to play them.He has been perceived to have trouble against quality spin, especially against Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh, who has dismissed Ponting on 13 occasions in International cricket, as of August 2010.
Ponting has a tendency to rock onto the front foot and thrust his wrists at spinning deliveries, resulting in many catches close to the wicket.
Ponting rarely employs the sweep shot against spin, something considered unusual for a top-order batsman.
Instead, he looks to use his feet to come down the wicket, or play off the back foot through the off-side.Former West Indian captain, Viv Richards , who was rated as the third best Test cricketer in a 2002 poll by Wisden, said Ponting was his favourite current-day player to watch, slightly ahead of Sachin Tendulkar .Bowling and fieldingA right-arm bowler, Ponting rarely bowls, although he has notably dismissed West Indian batsman Brian Lara in an ODI match and former England captain Michael Vaughan in an Ashes Test in 2005.
Ponting has often been criticised for his lack of imagination in his captaincy, though many players who played under him say he is a good leader.
According to former Australian opening batsman Justin Langer, "He is quite inspirational as a leader and I just never get all the detractors he has.
Whether it's in the fielding practice, the nets, the way he holds himself off the field—every time he speaks, these young guys just listen, they hang on every word he says.""Ponting
captained 2 consecutive World Cup victories in 2003 and 2007 " Ponting holds the world record for being part of a team in most ODI wins- he finished on the winning side in 262 ODIs.
Ponting score of 242 against India is the record for the highest individual score in a test innings in a losing cause.
Throughout his career in international cricket, Ponting has been involved in the writing of a number of diaries on Australian cricket, which depict his experiences during the cricketing year.
The books are produced with the help of a ghostwriter .
His autobiography, Ponting: At the Close of Play, was published and released in November 2013.

He is the current captain of New Zealand in all three forms of the international game.
He played for the Kolkata Knight Riders from 2008-2010 and again from 2012-2013, while in between he played for the Kochi Tuskers Kerala .
McCullum was a wicket-keeper until 2013, and is known for his fast scoring rate.His brother Nathan McCullum is also a first-class and international cricketer, and their father Stuart McCullum was a long-serving first-class player for Otago .
Both Brendon and Nathan attended King's High School .McCullum is the leading career scorer in Twenty20 International cricket and is the first and so far only player to have scored two Twenty20 International centuries and 2000 runs in T20 Internationals.
On 18 February 2014, McCullum scored 302 runs against India making him the first New Zealand cricketer to score a triple hundred in Test cricket.
On 2 March 2008, before facing England for the test series, McCullum was involved in the State Shield Final versus the Auckland Aces , in scoring 170 runs for the Otago Volts to help beat the Aces at Eden Park 's outer oval, and helped to chased down a daunting total of 310 for 7, he broke multiple State Shield batting records.State Shield , including 14 fours and 5 sixes.When he got to 135, he scored the highest individual runs for an Otago Volts player.When he got to 162, he scored the highest score by any player in a domestic one-day match  overtaking Blair Hartland 's previous record.McCullum played for Glamorgan in 2006 and he scored 160 opening the batting against Leicestershire in the County Championship.On 24 January 2009, he lined up for New South Wales in the final of Australia's KFC Twenty20 Big Bash.
This was an exercise to allow him to be eligible to play for them in the Twenty20 Champions League.
This sparked criticism however despite opinion States are permitted to have one overseas player in their squad.
McCullum also donated his match fee from the game to Otago Junior Cricket.On 16 January 2010 during the 2009-10 HRV Cup , vs Auckland Aces at University Oval , McCullum hit 108 not out off 67 deliveries, which included 10 fours and four sixes to lead Otago Volts to victory with three balls to spare.
McCullum reached his 50 off 32 deliveries and his century off 65 deliveries.See also: List of centuries in Twenty20 International cricketIn 2003 he played in a Test series against England and scored what was then his highest score, an innings of 96 at Lord's .
His maiden Test century came several months later when he scored 143 against Bangladesh .
He fell just short of his second Test hundred in a game against Sri Lanka when dismissed one short of his hundred.
His second century would later come with a run a ball 111 against Zimbabwe .He was selected in the 20-man ICC World XI squad for the ICC Super Series in July 2005.On 20 February 2007, he scored 86 not out as New Zealand went on to be the first team to whitewash Australia in a three-match ODI series since 1997.
During the innings he partnered with Craig McMillan to score 165, equalling the world record for a 6th wicket partnership.
On 31 December 2007 he scored 50 from just 19 balls against Bangladesh.
He finished his innings with 80 runs from only 28 balls, including 9 fours and 6 sixes with a strike rate of 285.71.On 18 April 2008, he achieved the highest Twenty20 individual score in an innings.
which was later surpassed by Englishman Graham Napier .He was bought by Kochi Tuskers Kerala in the 2011 IPL auctions.
He returned to the Knight Riders in 2012.
In the 2014 IPL auctions, McCullum was bought by Chennai Super Kings .
He was given the role of opening the innings along with West Indian Dwayne Smith and the pair was considered as the most dangerous opening pair in the league's history.On 5 April 2009, on day three of the third Test match during India's tour of New Zealand , he displayed an amazing level of alertness in the dismissal of Rahul Dravid .
Dravid attempted a sweep shot off Daniel Vettori 's bowling, but McCullum saw what Dravid was up to before the ball had even pitched and moved swiftly to his left .
Ross Taylor at first slip did the same.
The ball came nicely off Dravid's bat, but flew straight into the hands of a waiting Brendon McCullum.
On 6 November 2009, vs Pakistan at Abu Dhabi, McCullum scored his second ODI century  to elevate New Zealand to 303 and win the match to level the series.
On 16 February 2010, during the only Test match against Bangladesh , he scored 185, the highest score ever by a New Zealand wicket-keeper in Test cricket.
He was also involved in the record highest sixth-wicket partnership for New Zealand of 339 runs with Martin Guptill , missing out on the world record by just 12 runs.On 27 February 2010, becomes just the second player to score a T20I hundred , finishing 116 not out, one run short of Chris Gayle 's record of 117.On 4 May 2010 McCullum became the first player to score 1000 T20 international runs.
He achieved this feat playing against Zimbabwe in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 at Guyana On 28 June 2010, Brendon McCullum said he will not keep wicket for New Zealand in Test matches.
He, however informed that he will still keep in 50-overs & T20 over games.
On 21 September 2012 at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka, McCullum scored 123 runs against Bangladesh at Pallekele , setting a new record for the highest Twenty20 International innings, and becoming the first player to score two Twenty20 International centuries .
This record was broken by Aaron Finch on the 29th of August against England, when he scored 156.
However McCullum still remains the only player to have scored two Twenty20 International centuries.
Between 16 and 18 February 2014 at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, McCullum scored 302 runs in the third innings of the second test against India, becoming the first New Zealand batsman to score a triple-century .
He shared a 352 run partnership with BJ Watling , a record sixth wicket stand , On 21 November 2014, McCullum recorded his first ever wicket at test level, a caught-and-bowled of Pakistan's Sarfraz Ahmed during their second test.On 29 November 2014, McCullum scored a century on day 2 of the third test against the same opposition, in which both teams decided to call off play on the day before as a tribute to Phillip Hughes , and hand-written P.H. under each player's squad number as a further mark of respect.
He was bowled out on 202 after hitting ten sixes in his innings, by far a record for New Zealand opening batsman.
Two years after his debut as NZ captain, in which the team was bowled out for a paltry 45, Black Caps returned to respectability.On 13 December 2014, McCullum was named New Zealander of the Year by the New Zealand Herald beating out stiff competition from Lane Pilkington due to his continued co-operation with ICC over the match-fixing scandal which resulted in Chris Cairns being charged for lying to court, and also for changing the perception of the Black Caps as easy-beats.
On the first day of the Boxing Day Test at Hagley Oval , McCullum scored 195 in the first innings against Sri Lanka, which gave him 1000 test runs in a calendar year, becoming the first New Zealander to reach this milestone ,  It ended with an 8-wicket win, which made it 5 test wins out of 9 in 2014, the most wins in a calendar year.
He also closed the year with a triple century and two double centuries, the third person to do so after Donald Bradman and Michael Clarke .On 3 January 2015, McCullum returned to Basin Reserve, where he scored his triple century against India.
While he got a 2-ball duck on a green pitch and three errors as a fielder, he was given a key to Wellington, a symbolic equivalent of "Honourary Citizen", joining Wellington-born Sir Peter Jackson and Sir Richard Taylor for their works on Lord of The Rings as the third person to receive such a gift for last year's heroics.
However, the ground witnessed a double century that test by Kumar Sangakkara , a fellow former test wicketkeeper-batsman.On 20 February 2015, in New Zealand's 3rd Pool A match of the 2015 Cricket World Cup , McCullum scored 77 runs of 25 balls recording the fastest 50 in world cup history , and the 4th fastest 50 in ODI history.
He also delivered brutal innings against Australia, and South Africa in the semi-final as well.
McCullum became the first New Zealand captain to lead his team to the World Cup finals, by putting the six semi-final losses in the past.McCullum played in the 2015 Cricket World Cup Final , and was bowled for a duck in just the first over of the match by Mitchell Starc , as New Zealand went on to lose to Australia by 7 wickets.On 21 May 2015, McCullum started in his 93rd consecutive test, and batting in his preferred spot at no. 5.McCullum originally played in the side as a wicketkeeper -batsman.
His glovework improved during his tenure as the New Zealand wicketkeeper.
His batting is good enough to earn him selection for the Black Caps alone, shown by the occasions on which he has been unable to keep but has still been selected as a batsman.
The stint included the entire domestic 2006 Twenty20 Cup.
He was signed up by the Kolkata Knight Riders of the IPL for $700,000.
His contract with the IPL is for three years.He has the ability to play the Dilscoop , which involves the batsman squatting down and scooping deliveries back over the wicketkeeper's head.
Playing this shot in a Twenty20 International match on 28 February 2010 in Lancaster Park , Christchurch, against Australia, he managed to hit Shaun Tait for two sixes in an over back over Brad Haddin 's head.
He can also execute reverse sweep well.During the Twenty20 World Championship in 2009, the wicketkeeping duties was given to Peter McGlashan .
He was seen practicing his medium bowling.McCullum had to decide whether to play for New South Wales, KKR, or Otago in the 1st edition of the Champions League.
Since KKR did not qualify, he had only to consider playing for either New South Wales or Otago; eventually he had decided to play for Otago alongside brother Nathan McCullum .
In 2012, BJ Watling became McCullum's replacement as wicketkeeper in Tests, but due to Luke Ronchi 's struggles in ODI's, McCullum still remained as wicketkeeper in ODIs and T20s.
But by late 2013, McCullum's recurring back problems meant he can no longer perform wicketkeeping duties effectively, he gave up his gloves to Ronchi in ODIs and T20s, and McCullum became a middle order batsman, or as a cover for opening the batting in tests, having batted at 1,2,5–7 in his career, while his fielding position becomes predominantly mid-off, mid-on or mid-wicket.
McCullum was picked for 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup as an opening batsman due to inconsistencies from Martin Guptill and Tom Latham and the emergence of Grant Elliott as a solid option at no. 5 batsman.
His role as a pinch hitter saw the team reach their first ever World Cup final.
After the World Cup, he returned to his preferred spot at number 5 for test cricket.In the 2015 Queen's Birthday Honours McCullum was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to cricket.

A finger injury in mid-2003 sidelined him for much of the following year, allowing Kumble to regain his position as the first choice spinner in Tests and ODI's.
Harbhajan reclaimed a regular position in the team upon his return in late 2004, but often found himself watching from the sidelines in Test matches outside the Indian subcontinent with typically only one spinner, Kumble, being used.
Throughout 2006 and into early 2007, Harbhajan's accumulation of wickets fell and his bowling average increased, and he was increasingly criticised for bowling defensively with less loop.
Following India's first-round elimination from the 2007 Cricket World Cup , Harbhajan was replaced by other spinners in the national squad for both formats.
He regained a regular position in the team in late 2007, but became the subject of more controversy.
In early 2008, he was given a ban by the International Cricket Council  for slapping Sreesanth after a match.
He appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling 's Indian promotion, Ring Ka King .He was in world cup winning team of 2011 Cricket World Cup .Early years and personal lifeHarbhajan was born into a Sikh family.
He is the only son of Sardar Sardev Singh Plaha, a businessman who owned a ball bearing and valve factory.
Harbhajan was trained as a batsman by his first coach Charanjit singh Bhullar, but converted to spin bowling after his coach's untimely death saw him turn to the tutelage of Davinder Arora.
Arora credits Harbhajan's success to a work ethic that included a three-hour training session in the morning, followed by an afternoon session lasting from 3 pm until after sunset.
Following the death of his father in 2000, Harbhajan became the family head, and by 2001 had organised marriages for three of his sisters.
In a country where cricketers are idolised, Harbhajan's performances have brought him government accolades and lucrative sponsorships.
Following his performance against Australia in 2001, the Government of Punjab awarded him Rs. 5 lakhs , a plot of land, and an offer to become a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Punjab Police, which he accepted.Despite having a job with the constabulary, Harbhajan sustained minor injuries in March 2002 in an altercation with police outside the team hotel in Guwahati .
The scuffle broke out when Harbhajan remonstrated with officers after they refused to allow a photographer into the hotel.
Harbhajan cut his bowling arm and injured his elbow when he was struck by the police.
Extensive negotiations from local officials and organisers were required to dissuade Harbhajan and captain Sourav Ganguly from leaving the area after Ganguly said that the Indian team would abandon the scheduled match against Zimbabwe .
One of his common nicknames, outside India, is The Turbanator, deriving from his skill as a bowler in terminating the innings of the opposing team, and the fact that, as a Sikh , he wears a black turban whenever he plays.
In 2006 Harbhajan's endorsements generated controversy when he appeared without his turban in an advertisement for Royal Stag whisky .
This angered many orthodox Sikhs, leading to anti-Harbhajan protests in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar , with effigies of Harbhajan being burnt.
Harbhajan broke into the Punjab Under-16s at the age of 15 years and 4 months in November of the 1995–96 season, and took 7/46 and 5/138 on debut against Haryana , setting up a nine-wicket win.
He scored 56 in his next match against Delhi and then took 11/79 in his third match against Himachal Pradesh , orchestrating an innings win.
He ended with 32 wickets at 15.15 and 96 runs at 48.00 in four matches.
He was rewarded with selection for North Zone Under-16s, a team that represents all of northern India for a one-day series, in which he took two wickets at 43.50 in four matches and scored 18 runs.
In 1996–97, Harbhajan was promoted to the Punjab Under-19s and he took 15 wickets at 20.20 in three matches, although he managed only two runs with the bat.
This included match figures of 8/54 in an innings win over Jammu and Kashmir .
Harbhajan made his first-class cricket debut in late 1997 against Services , during the 1997–98 Ranji Trophy season.
He took a total of 3/35 in an innings win but was dropped back to the Under-19s the following week.
He then took 5/75 and 7/44 in two matches to earn a recall to the senior team.
He then took a total of 7/123 in the next two matches for Punjab to earn selection for North Zone in the Duleep Trophy .
Harbhajan's season was interrupted when he represented India at the Under-19 World Cup in January 1998.
He played in six matches, taking eight wickets at 24.75 with a best of 3/5 against Kenya .
Returning to India he played in three more Ranji Trophy matches, and from a total of six matches, he took 18 wickets at an average of 22.50, ranking outside the top 20 in wicket taking.
Despite the superior statistics of other bowlers in domestic cricket, Harbhajan was the selected for the Indian Board President's XI to play the touring Australian cricket team ahead of the Tests.
He managed only 1/127, Harbhajan was fined and given a suspended ban for one ODI by the match referee in his first international series, when his on-field behaviour was adjudged to breach the ICC Code of Conduct .
The incident in question was his altercation with Ricky Ponting after dismissing him.
Harbhajan was then omitted from the team during a home triangular ODI tournament against Bangladesh and Kenya , after taking 0/18 from four overs in his only match of the tournament against the former opponent, Harbhajan was then recalled to the first-choice team and took five wickets at an average of 22.60 at 3.89 runs an over from three matches on a tour to Zimbabwe , in what would prove to be his last ODI appearances for India for more than two years.
After taking 2/38 and 3/60 in an innings win in a tour match, Harbhajan was retained in the Test team, taking 2/42 and 3/63 in the only Test on the Zimbabwe tour.
He was unbeaten on 15 in the second innings as the final wicket fell and India succumbed to a 51-run defeat.
Returning to India, Harbhajan started the 1998–99 domestic season well, taking 3/54 and 5/39 in an innings win over Services, before following up with 6/69 and 1/93 in the next match against Delhi, claiming his first five-wicket innings haul.
He then took 6/63 and scored 31 in the first innings of a match for the Board PResident's XI against a touring West Indies A, and was taken on the tour of New Zealand in December.
In a tour match against Central Districts , Harbhajan struggled, aggregating 2/112.
He only played in one Test during the tour, and went wicketless, conceding 72 runs.
He also registered his maiden first-class fifty, scoring an unbeaten 67 against Tamil Nadu cricket team .Harbhajan took four wickets at 33.00 during the one-dayers during the season and was overlooked for the ODI team for the whole season and missed selection for the 1999 Cricket World Cup .
After taking 4/91 against the touring team for the Board President's XI at the start of the season, Harbhajan managed to retain his Test position for the late 1999 home series against New Zealand , as India fielded a three-pronged spin attack on dusty tracks, taking six wickets at an average of 32.66 as the hosts prevailed 1–0 in the two Tests.
After taking eight wickets in his next two Ranji matches, Harbhajan was selected to tour Australia in 1999–2000 , as the second spinner.
He did not play in the Tests, with India opting to field only Anil Kumble in the team.
Harbhajan was not part of the ODI squad for the Australian tour and upon returning to India in early-2000 needed strong first-class results to maintain his Test position.
He went wicketless against Hyderabad, and was selected for the Board President's XI match against the touring South Africans.
He took 2/88 and 2/59 and scored 38 and 39 to prevent the hosts being bowled out and defeated, but was dropped as the second slow bowler, as Murali Kartik became Kumble's spinning partner.
In mid-2000 an opportunity arose when Harbhajan was selected in the first group of trainees sent to the National Cricket Academy to study under Erapalli Prasanna and Srinivas Venkataraghavan , two off spin bowlers from the Indian spin quartet of the 1970s.
However, his behaviour did not conform to requirements, and he was expelled on disciplinary grounds.
Following his run-ins with Indian cricket administrators, there was nothing to indicate that Harbhajan's chances of national selection had improved at the start of 2000–01.
Despite Kumble being injured, Harbhajan was again overlooked as Kartik, Sunil Joshi , and debutant Sarandeep Singh were entrusted with the spin bowling duties in Test matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe on the subcontinent.
During the first half of the season, still in international exile, Harbhajan continued to pick up wickets on the domestic circuit.
In five Ranji Trophy matches, he claimed 28 wickets at 13.96.
He claimed 3/29 and 3/39 against Himachal Pradesh, 2/53 and 5/88 against Jammu and Kashmir, 4/77 and 2/33 against Haryana and 5/40 against Services in the first four matches, all of which ended in innings wins for Punjab.
He then took a total of 4/32 in a 199-run win over Delhi.
Harbhajan's batting, which had rarely been productive up to this point in his career, also improved.
He scored a career-best 84 against Haryana and added 52 against Services, aggregating 207 runs at 51.75.
With Kumble injured before the home series in March 2001 against the visiting Australians, With leading paceman Javagal Srinath ruled out of the series with a finger injury during the First Test, The teams arrived in Chennai for the deciding Third Test, and Australia's batsmen again seized control after winning the toss, reaching 340/3 on the second morning.
Then, Australian captain Steve Waugh padded away a delivery from Harbhajan.
The ball spun back into Waugh's stumps, who pushed the ball away with his glove, becoming only the sixth batsman in Tests to be given out " handled the ball ".
He was named man of the match and man of the series , having taken 32 wickets at 17.03 for the series, Harbhajan's Test success saw him recalled to the ODI team after more than two years.
He was unable to reproduce his Test form against Australia, managing only four wickets at an average of 59.25 and economy rate of 5.04.
His best performance was a 3/37 in a 118-run win in the third match, and a cameo batting performance of 46 runs from 34 balls, including three sixes, in a losing run chase in the fourth fixture.
He was dropped from the ODI team during a subsequent triangular tournament in Zimbabwe in 2001 after only managing two wickets at 69.00 in four matches although he had been economical at 3.63 runs an over.
Harbhajan was omitted from the Indian team in favour of Kumble as the first-choice spinner on the following tour of South Africa , only playing in the later matches when India fielded two spinners.
Nevertheless, Harbhajan continued to do well in the ODIs, taking nine wickets at 20.44 in six matches at an economy rate of 3.53, winning his first man of the match award in the ODI form in an ODI against South Africa in Bloemfontein after taking 3/27 from his ten overs.
Harbhajan's Test fortunes improved immediately upon the start of the 2001–02 international season in India.
Playing in his first international match at his home ground in Mohali , Punjab , Harbhajan took match figures of 7/110, including 5/51 in the first innings, to help India win the First Test by ten wickets against the touring English team .
He continued his steady form throughout the series with another five wicket haul in the Second Test in Ahmedabad , to end with thirteen wickets at 24.53 for the series, although he went wicketless in 27.1 overs in the Third and final Test.
Harbhajan's overseas difficulties returned during the tour of the West Indies in mid-2002.
He injured his shoulder while fielding in a tour match in which he started well with a total of 5/70, Despite his performance at Sabina Park, Harbhajan was dropped again when Kumble returned for the First Test on the tour to England at Lord's , where the hosts prevailed.
India's coach John Wright later admitted that Harbhajan's omission had been a mistake.
The 2002 ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka at the end of the tour brought moderate results with six wickets at 30.66 at an economy rate of only 3.68, As was the case in the previous season, Harbhajan's return to Indian soil coincided with an improvement in results.
He took 1/37 and 7/48 in an innings victory at Mumbai in the First Test against the West Indies , and then contributed match figures of 3/56, 4/79 and 37 in an eight-wicket victory in Chennai which saw him named man of the match.
The off spinner then took 1/56 in one ODI before heading for his World Cup debut in South Africa.Harbhajan had a mixed tournament at the 2003 Cricket World Cup , taking 11 wickets at 30.45 with an economy rate of 3.92 in ten matches.
He was the first-choice spinner and played in all matches but one, being dropped for the victory against arch-rivals Pakistan in the group phase.
His counterpart, Kumble, played in only three matches.
After experiencing pains in his spinning finger during the World Cup, Harbhajan was scheduled to undergo surgery in mid-2003 in Australia, After a seven-month layoff, Harbhajan returned to represent India in ODIs in the Asia Cup in July 2004, where he took four wickets at 39.75 in four matches at 3.97 runs per over.
His performance improved on the tour to England for an ODI series against England and the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy , taking eight wickets at 14.00, conceding only 2.80 runs an over, including 3/28 against England and 3/33 against Kenya and hitting as an unbeaten 41 against England at The Oval as India's batting collapsed to a substantial defeat.
Harbhajan made his Test return against Australia, who were again seeking their first series win on Indian soil since 1969 in the late 2004 home series .
A Test series in India against South Africa followed, with Harbhajan taking match figures of 4/166 in the drawn First Test in Kanpur , before producing a man of the match performance in the Second Test in Calcutta to lead India to a 1–0 series win.
After taking 2/54 in the first innings, he took 6/78 in the second, including South Africa's first five batsman to help dismiss the tourists for 222.
This set up a run-chase of 117, which India reached with eight wickets in hand.
His performance in Bangladesh saw him dropped for the First Test in the early 2005 series against Pakistan on his home ground in Mohali , with Kumble being the only spinner selected on the pace-friendly surface.
Harbhajan's first outings under newly appointed coach Greg Chappell came at the Indian Oil Cup in Sri Lanka in August 2005.
He took five wickets at 31.40, conceding 4.02 runs per over in four matches, but was wicketless in the final, which was won by the host nation.
Harbhajan's difficulties were compounded when he earned the ire of cricket authorities by publicly attacking Chappell and defending Ganguly after the team returned to India.
Harbhajan was under pressure to perform when Sri Lanka toured India in late 2005 following his attack on Chappell and the replacement of Ganguly, who had frequently supported him during previous career difficulties, with new captain Rahul Dravid .
In addition, his home ODI form had been poor in the previous three years, managing only 12 wickets at 56 in 16 matches, with an economy rate of 4.8.
He put on another strong personal performance in the first ODI of the following series against South Africa in Hyderabad , where he struck an aggressive unbeaten 37 from 17 balls, including two sixes, to help India recover to 249/9, before taking 1/35 from his 10 overs.
The year ended with a three Test series against Sri Lanka.
After the first match in Chennai was washed out by monsoonal rains, 2006 began with Harbhajan's first tour to arch-rivals Pakistan.
The First Test was a high scoring draw held in Lahore , where Harbhajan recorded his worst ever Test figures of 0/176, conceding more than five runs an over in a match where 1,089 runs were scored for the loss of just eight wickets.
A return to Indian soil for the Test series against England failed to ease Harbhajan's wicket-taking difficulties.
He managed match figures of 2/172 in the drawn First Test in Nagpur , and 1/83 in the Second Test in Mohali , where his main contribution was to hit 36 runs, helping India to a first innings lead.
Harbhajan was unable to maintain his ODI form on the tour to the West Indies , where he managed three wickets at 64 in five matches, although he continued to be economical, conceding 3.91 runs per over.
The 2006–07 season began with the DLF Cup in Malaysia, where Harbhajan made a good start to the season, taking six wickets at 19.16 at an economy rate of 3.59 in four matches.
Harbhajan returned for the early 2007 ODI series against the West Indies and Sri Lanka in India, taking seven wickets at 36.00 in seven matches at an economy rate of 4.27.
During the 2007 Cricket World Cup , Harbhajan started as India's first-choice spinner and played in their first match against Bangladesh.
He took 0/30 from his ten overs, but India lost the match as their batsmen collapsed and Bangladesh had no need to take risks against the bowling.
In the meantime, Harbhajan played in two ODIs for the Asian Cricket Council against a combined African team, taking 1/53 and 3/48 as the Asians won both matches.
Harbhajan returned to international cricket as part of India's squad for the ICC World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa in September 2007, which India won, having been rank outsiders at the start of the tournament with many senior players opting out of the competition.
Harbhajan was recalled to the ODI squad during India's home season in 2006–07, which comprised series against Australia and Pakistan.
In ten ODIs, he took seven wickets at 61.71 and an economy rate of 4.59, much higher than his career average.
While Harbhajan was batting during his 63 on the third day of the Second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground , he became involved in an altercation with Australia's Andrew Symonds .
As a result of this, he was charged with a Level 3 offence of racially abusing Symonds by calling the Australian—of Caribbean descent—a "monkey".
Harbhajan and Tendulkar, his batting partner at the time of the incident, denied this.
Harbhajan , batting with Tendulkar during the Second Test at the SCG.
The altercation with Symonds occurred during their partnership.On 29 January, following the Fourth Test, the appeal hearing was conducted in Adelaide by ICC Appeals Commissioner Justice John Hansen .
The result was that the racism charge was not proved, resulting in the revocation of the three-Test ban imposed by Procter.
However, Harbhajan was found guilty of using abusive language and fined 50% of his match fee.
Hansen later admitted he "could have imposed a more serious penalty if he was made aware by the ICC of the bowler's previous transgressions"—including a suspended one-Test ban.
In the aftermath of the hearing, Hayden called Harbhajan an "obnoxious weed" during a radio interview, which earned him a code of conduct violation charge from Cricket Australia .
Following the appeal, Harbhajan played in all eight of India's round-robin matches in the Commonwealth Bank series, which also involved Sri Lanka, taking five wickets at 39.00.
In the two finals matches, Australia suffered a top-order collapse and lost their first three wickets with only 24 and 32 runs on the board respectively.
Symonds and Hayden—with whom Harbhajan clashed during the summer—led a recovery with stands of 100 and 89 respectively.
In both matches, Harbhajan had a hand in removing both of his bitter opponents.
In the first final in Sydney, he removed both in the space of four overs, caught from his bowling.
In the second final in Brisbane, he completed the run out of Hayden after a mix-up, and then trapped Symonds leg before wicket in the same over.
Australia lost the momentum and their run-rate slowed, and India went on to win the series 2–0.
Harbhajan ended with 2/38 and 1/44 from his 10 overs in the respective matches.Following the tour of Australia, India hosted South Africa in a three-Test series.
The First Test in Chennai was a high-scoring draw in which 1,498 runs were scored for the loss of 25 wickets.
Harbhajan was the top wicket-taker for the match, with figures of 5/161 and 3/101.
In the Second Test in Ahmedabad, he was India's leading wicket-taker for the third consecutive innings, taking 4/135 as the home team lost by an innings.
With India needing a win in the Third Test in Kanpur to avoid series defeat, Harbhajan again took the leading bowling figures in both innings, with 3/52 and 4/44.
His second innings effort helped bowl out the tourists for 121 and set up an eight-wicket win.
As a result of his efforts, Harbhajan was named man-of-the-series, having taken 19 wickets at 25.94.
Sreesanth , who was slapped by Harbhajan.Harbhajan was involved in further controversy after an 2008 Indian Premier League  match between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab at Mohali in April 2008.
While the teams were shaking hands, he slapped Punjab paceman and Indian team-mate Sreesanth in the face.
As a result, Harbhajan missed the tri-series in Bangladesh and the 2008 Asia Cup in Pakistan, and India went down in the final of both tournaments after qualifying first on both occasions.
He would have been eligible for selection after the first two matches of the Asia Cup, but the selectors omitted him entirely.Harbhajan returned to international cricket for the tour of Sri Lanka in July and August.
In the First Test at Colombo, he took 2/149 as Sri Lanka amassed 600/6 declared and won by an innings.
In the Second Test in Galle, he took 6/102 to help India take a first innings lead of 37 and then took 4/51 in the second innings to help India level the series with a 170-run win.

The series also saw the end of Harbhajan's partnership with Kumble, who missed the Second Test due to injury and then retired after suffering another wound in the next match.
As a result, Harbhajan started a new pairing with leg spinner Amit Mishra .In the five-match home ODI series against England, Harbhajan took seven wickets at 30.29 and an economy rate of 5.04 as India won 5–0.
He took one wicket in each of the matches, except the third match in Kanpur.
In that match, he took 3/31, registered his 200th ODI wicket and was named man-of-the match.

He then struggled at the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa, taking 1/71 from ten overs against Pakistan and 0/54 from nine overs against Australia.

elevation.
The population was 72,301 at the 2014 census.
The capital is Roseau , located on the leeward side of the island.The island was discovered by the Spanish, but colonized predominately by the French.
Great Britain took it over in 1763 after the Seven Years' War and gradually established English as the official language.
The island republic gained independence in 1978.Its name is pronounced with emphasis on the third syllable, related to its former Dominique.
Dominica has been nicknamed the "Nature Isle of the Caribbean" for its unspoiled natural beauty.
It is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles, still being formed by geothermal - volcanic activity, as evidenced by the world's second-largest hot spring , Boiling Lake .
The island has lush mountainous rainforests , and is the home of many rare plants, animals, and bird species.
There are xeric areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall occurs inland.
The Sisserou parrot , is found only on Dominica and is the island's national bird and features on the national flag .
Dominica's economy depends on tourism and agriculture.Etymology and languagesThe name Dominica comes from the Latin word dies Dominica for Sunday, the day on which the island was spotted by explorer Christopher Columbus .
Its pre-Columbian name by the Caribs was Wai‘tu kubuli, which means "Tall is her body".
The indigenous people of the island were the Island Caribs or Kalinago.The island became multi-ethnic due to European colonization, which included the importation of numerous African slaves.
The French had the longest influence prior to ceding the island to the British in 1763 after losing the Seven Years' War .
Although English is now the official language, an Antillean Creole , based on the French language, West African and Carib influences, is still spoken by many residents, especially people of older generations.Today the Carib have the use of some reserved land, known as the Carib Territory , an area similar to the Indian reserves of Canada or the US.
The official language is English, following the island's history since the late 18th century as a British colony , territory , and state .
The demonym or adjective is "Dominican" in English.
It is pronounced with the syllable stress on the second "i", to distinguish it from the Dominican Republic , where the stress is on the first "i".
Before Europeans, the island was inhabited by the Kalinago people .Christopher Columbus spotted the island on 3 November 1493  and named it after the day of the week.For a century, the island remained isolated.
As European explorers and settlers entered the region, indigenous refugees from surrounding islands settled Dominica and pushed out the Spanish settlers, who found other areas easier to control and with more resources.
France colonized Dominica for several years, importing numerous African slaves to work on plantations.
They soon became a majority on the island, and developed the Antillean Creole language based on French and incorporating their West African languages of origin, and some Carib.Spain had little success in colonizing Dominica.
In 1632, the French Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique claimed Dominica and other "Petite Antilles" for France, but no physical occupation took place.
Between 1642 and 1650, French missionary Raymond Breton became the first regular European visitor to the island.In 1660, the French and English agreed that Dominica and St. Vincent should not be settled, but left to the Caribs as neutral territory.
Dominica was officially neutral for the next century.
But its natural resources attracted rival expeditions of English and French foresters, who began harvesting timber by the start of the 18th century.
Already installed in Martinique and Guadeloupe and cultivating sugar cane, the French gradually developed plantations in Dominique for coffee.
They imported so many African slaves to fill the labor demands that the population became overwhelmingly African in ethnicity.In 1761, during the Seven Years' War in Europe, a British expedition against Dominica led by Lord Rollo conquered the island along with several other Caribbean islands.
After France lost the war in 1763, it ceded the island to Britain under the Treaty of Paris  .
The same year, Britain established a legislative assembly , representing only the white population.
French remained the official language, but Antillean Creole was spoken by most people.
In 1778, during the American Revolutionary War , the French invaded with the active cooperation of the population.
The 1783 Treaty of Paris , which ended the war, returned the island to Britain.
French invasions in 1795 and 1805 ended in failure.
Great Britain established a small colony in 1805.
In 1831, reflecting a liberalization of official British racial attitudes, the Brown Privilege Bill  conferred political and social rights on free blacks .In 1835, the first three men of African descent were elected to the legislative assembly.
Many slaves from the neighboring islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique fled to Dominica.
In 1838, Dominica became the first British Caribbean colony to have an elected legislature controlled by an ethnic African majority; most of these legislators had been smallholders or merchants before the abolition of slavery.
Their economic and social views were different from the interests of the small, wealthy English planter class.
Reacting to a perceived threat to their power, the planters lobbied for more direct British rule.
In 1865, after much agitation and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one that had one-half of members who were elected and one-half who were appointed.
Planters allied with colonial administrators outmaneuvered the elected legislators on many occasions.
In 1871, Dominica became part of the Leeward Island Federation .
The power of the ethnic African population progressively eroded.
Crown Colony government was re-established in 1896.
All political rights were curtailed for people of color and blacks, who were the overwhelming majority of the population.
Development aid, offered as compensation for disfranchisement, resulted in negligible improvements in conditions for most ethnic Africans.
In 1914–1918 World War I , many Dominicans, mainly the sons of small farmers, volunteered to fight in Europe for the British Empire.
After the war, an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the Representative Government Association .
Marshaling public frustration with the lack of a voice in governing Dominica, this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924, and one-half in 1936.
Shortly thereafter, Dominica was transferred from the Leeward Island Administration .
During World War II , some Dominicans volunteered in British and Caribbean forces.
Thousands of Free French refugees from Martinique and Guadeloupe escaped to Dominica from the Vichy -controlled French islands and stayed in Roseau and villages.Until 1958, Dominica was governed as part of the Windwards .
Caribbean islands sought independence from 1958 to 1962, and Dominica became a province of the short-lived West Indies Federation .
and almost immediately, a republic.
The British Crown was no longer the head of state.In mid-1979, political discontent led to the formation of an interim government.
After the 1980 elections, it was replaced by a government led by the Dominica Freedom Party under Prime Minister Eugenia Charles , the Caribbean's first female prime minister.
Chronic economic problems were compounded by the severe impact of hurricanes in 1979 and in 1980.In 1981, Dominica was threatened with a takeover by mercenaries By the end of the 1980s, the economy recovered.
It weakened again in the 1990s due to a decrease in banana prices and worldwide recession.
In the January 2000 elections, the Edison James United Workers Party , led by Roosevelt P. "Rosie" Douglas .
Douglas died after only a few months in office and was replaced by Pierre Charles, who died in office in January 2004.
Roosevelt Skerrit , also of the DLP, replaced Charles as Prime Minister.
Under Prime Minister Skerrit's leadership, the DLP won elections in May 2005 that gave the party 12 seats in the 21-member Parliament to the UWP's 8 seats.
An independent candidate affiliated with the DLP won a seat as well.
Later, the independent candidate joined the government and one UWP member crossed the aisle, making the total 14 seats for the DLP and 7 for the UWP.
In the December 2009 elections, DLP won 18 of 21 seats.
UWP claimed campaign improprieties and boycotted Parliament; by-elections were conducted for two of its seats in July 2010, and the UWP again won the seats.
On 17 September 2012 Eliud Thaddeus Williams was sworn in as President, replacing Dr Nicholas Liverpool who was reportedly removed from office due to ill health.Geography and climateDominica is an island in the Eastern Caribbean Sea , located about halfway between the French islands of Guadeloupe Main articles: Geography of Dominica and Climate of DominicaDominica is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea , the northernmost of the Windward Islands .
The capital is Roseau .Dominica is largely covered by rainforest and is home to the world's second-largest hot spring , Boiling Lake .
The volcanic nature of the island has attracted scuba divers .
The island has several protected areas , including Cabrits National Park , as well as 365 rivers.On his second voyage to the Caribbean, Dominica was the first New World country that Christopher Columbus discovered.
It is said that when his royal sponsors asked Christopher Columbus to describe this island, he crumpled a piece of parchment roughly and threw it on the table.
"This", Columbus explained, "is what Dominica looks like—completely covered with mountains with nary a flat spot."Morne
Trois Pitons National Park is a tropical forest blended with scenic volcanic features.
The Commonwealth of Dominica is engaged in a long-running dispute with Venezuela over Venezuela's territorial claims to the sea surrounding Isla Aves  west of the island of Dominica.There are two primary population centres: Roseau .Dominica, known as "The Nature Island of the Caribbean" due to its spectacular, lush, and varied flora and fauna, which are protected by an extensive natural park system; the most mountainous of the Lesser Antilles, its volcanic peaks are cones of lava craters and include Boiling Lake, the second-largest, thermally active lake in the world possesses the most pristine wilderness in the Caribbean.
Originally, it was protected by sheer mountains which led the European powers to build ports and agricultural settlements on other islands.
More recently, the citizens of this island have sought to preserve its spectacular natural beauty by discouraging the type of high-impact tourism which has damaged nature in most of the Caribbean.Visitors can find large tropical forests, including one which is on the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites, hundreds of streams, coastlines and coral reefs.Dominica is home to many local artisans and traditional craftsman who cater to tourists, although not a thriving high end art scene.
One notable Dominican artist has risen to international acclaim.

Sisserou parrot ,. is also a Dominican endemic.
Both birds are rare and protected, though some forest is still threatened by logging in addition to the long-standing threat of hurricanes.The Caribbean Sea offshore of the island of Dominica is home to many cetaceans .
Most notably a group of sperm whales live in this area year round.
Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include spinner dolphins , pantropical spotted dolphins and bottlenose dolphins .
Less commonly seen animals include killer whales , false killer whales , pygmy sperm whales , dwarf sperm whales , Risso's dolphins , common dolphins , Atlantic spotted dolphins , humpback whales and Bryde's whales .
This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in whale-watching .Dominica is especially vulnerable to hurricanes as the island is located in what is referred to as the hurricane region.
In 1979, Dominica was hit directly by category 5 Hurricane David , causing widespread and extreme damage.
On 17 August 2007, Hurricane Dean , a category 1 at the time, hit the island.
A mother and her seven-year-old son died when a landslide caused by the heavy rains crushed their house.

The Commonwealth of Dominica is one of the Caribbean's few republics .
The president is the head of state , while executive power rests with the cabinet , headed by the prime minister .
The unicameral parliament consists of the 30-member House of Assembly , which consists of 21 directly elected members and nine senators, who may either be appointed by the president or elected by the other members of the House of Assembly.Unlike other former British colonies in the region, Dominica was never a Commonwealth realm , instead becoming a republic on independence.
Dominica is a full and participating member of the Caribbean Community .Dominica is also a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the US military, as covered under Article 98 .
In January 2008 Dominica joined the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas .The Commonwealth of Dominica is becoming in recent years a major international financial centre.
The largest sectors are " offshore banking , payment processing companies, and general corporate activities".
Regulation and supervision of the financial services industry is the responsibility of the Financial Service Unit of the Commonwealth of Dominica  under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance.The Commonwealth of Dominica is quickly becoming one of the largest banking centres in the world, and offshore services are also becoming its main source of income.
There are a number of service providers.
These include global financial institutions including Scotiabank , Royal Bank of Canada , Cathedral Investment Bank , First Caribbean International Bank , and The Interoceanic Bank of the Caribbean ;Starting in the mid-late 1990s, offshore financial centres , such as the Commonwealth of Dominica, came under increasing pressure from the OECD for their allegedly harmful tax regimes, where the OECD wished to prevent low-tax regimes from having an advantage in the global marketplace.
The OECD threatened to place the Commonwealth of Dominica and other financial centres on a "black list" and impose sanctions against them.
In 2008, Dominica had one of the lowest per capita gross domestic product  rates of Eastern Caribbean states.
Bananas and other agriculture dominate Dominica's economy, and nearly one-third of the labour force works in agriculture.
This sector, however, is highly vulnerable to weather conditions and to external events affecting commodity prices.
In 2007, Hurricane Dean caused significant damage to the agricultural sector as well as the country's infrastructure, especially roads.
In response to reduced European Union  banana trade preferences , the government has diversified the agricultural sector by promoting the production of coffee, patchouli , aloe vera , cut flowers, and exotic fruits such as mango, guava, and papaya.
Dominica has also had some success in increasing its manufactured exports, primarily soap.
Dominica is mostly volcanic and has few beaches; therefore, tourism has developed more slowly than on neighboring islands.
Nevertheless, Dominica's mountains, rainforests, freshwater lakes, hot springs, waterfalls, and diving spots make it an attractive eco-tourism destination.
Cruise ship stopovers have increased following the development of modern docking and waterfront facilities in Roseau, the capital.
Dominica's currency is the East Caribbean Dollar .Dominica is a beneficiary of the Caribbean Basin Initiative .
Dominica supposedly offers tax-free status to companies locating from abroad.
It is not known how many companies benefit from the tax-free status because of the strict confidentiality the government enforces, although it is known many Internet businesses utilise Dominica for this reason.
However, on 12 July 2012 Dominica signed an agreement with Poland to exchange tax information.
The Commonwealth of Dominica offers an official and legally mandated economic citizenship to those seeking a valid second passport.
The nationality law of Dominica authorizes the government to waive the normal requirement of seven years of legal residence to acquire citizenship in exchange for a cash contribution.
Total costs including all fees for a single applicant come to about $105,000, with an additional $25,000 specified for a spouse and up to two children under 18.
The Dominican passport holders can travel without a visa, or obtain a visa upon entry, to nearly 90 countries and territories.
Applying for Dominica citizenship requires interacting with official Government Approved Economic Citizenship Agents.There are two regional, and no international airports on the island.
The primary airport, Douglas-Charles Airport , about 15 minutes from Roseau on the southwest coast.
Douglas-Charles Airport is suitable for limited use of commercial jets because of runway length.
Douglas-Charles currently has regular service by BVI Airways , Winair , Seaborne Airlines and LIAT using twin turboprop aircraft like the ATR & Saab 340 , as well as Conviasa and Amerijet , which, using Boeing 727 Freighters , is the only airline with jet service to the republic.
A runway extension and service upgrade project began at Douglas-Charles Airport around 2006 and was finished in 2010.
In March 2013, airline American Eagle halted flights to the island citing high labor costs.

Major roads are two-lane highways which connect the capital, Roseau, with Portsmouth .
It takes about 45 minutes to drive from Portsmouth to Roseau.
Private minibuses form the major public transport system.
These major roads were recently reconstructed with assistance from the People's Republic of China and the European Union.
Due to Tropical Storm Erika, several road surfaces aand bridges were damaged by flooding and landslides, including on the newly completed E.O.
LeBlanc .
As of October 2015, communities in the south-east of the country remain inaccessible to road traffic.Main article: Demographics of DominicaThe vast majority of Dominicans are of African descent.
There is a growing mixed population, along with a significant Indo-Caribbean or East Indian groups, a small European origin minority  and there are small numbers of Lebanese, Syrians and Asians.
Dominica is also the only Eastern Caribbean island that still has a population of pre-Columbian native Caribs, who were exterminated or driven from neighbouring islands.
As of 2014 there are more than 3,000 Caribs remaining.
They live in eight villages on the east coast of Dominica.
This special Carib Territory was granted by the British Crown in 1903.
There are also about 1,000 medical students from the United States and Canada who study at the Ross University School of Medicine in Portsmouth.The population growth rate of Dominica is very low, due primarily to emigration to other countries.
In the early 21st century, emigrant numbers for the most popular countries are as follows: the United States .It has recently been noted that Dominica has a relatively large number of centenarians .
As of March 2007, there are 22 centenarians out of the island's 70,000 inhabitants—three times the average incidence of centenarianism in developed countries.
The reasons for this are the subject of current research being undertaken at Ross University School of Medicine.Dominica was partially integrated into the federal colony of the Leeward Islands in 1832.
Later, in 1871, it became a full part of the Federation of the Leeward Islands.
From the start it was a peculiar relationship for previously Dominica had played no part in the political or cultural traditions of the other more Anglophone islands of the federation.
Now, as a Leeward Island, this much larger territory, with thousands of acres of forested unclaimed land, was open to the people of Montserrat and Antigua .
At the beginning of the 20th century the Rose's Company, which produced Rose's lime juice , saw demand for its product outgrow its ability to supply the product from Montserrat.
Their response to the situation was to buy land on Dominica and encourage Montserrat farm labourers to relocate.
As a result, there came to be two linguistic communities in Dominica, Wesley and Marigot .In 1902, on 8 May, the Mount Pelée volcano on Martinique erupted destroying the city of Saint-Pierre .
Refugees from Martinique arrived in boats to the southern villages of Dominica and some remained permanently on the island.English is the official language of Dominica and is universally spoken and understood.
However, because of historic French occupation during different times in history, and the island's location , Antillean Creole , based on French , is spoken by many people on the island.
The French creole language is particularly used among the older generation, which also speaks a language known as " patois ".
Because of a decline in its usage by the younger generation, initiatives have been set up in an effort to increase usage and promote this unique part of the nation's history and culture.The dialect of Dominica also includes Kokoy, along with Creole —French-based patois.
Cocoy , or Kokoy,  As a result of this mixture of languages and heritage, Dominica is a member of both the English-speaking Commonwealth of Nations and the French-speaking La Francophonie .Island Carib , also known as Igneri , was an Arawakan language historically spoken by the Island Caribs of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean .
The Island Caribs lived throughout the southern Lesser Antilles such as Dominica, St Vincent and Trinidad , supposedly having conquered them from their previous inhabitants, the Igneri .
It went extinct about 1920, but an offshoot survives as Garifuna , primarily in Central America.About 80% of the population is Roman Catholic , though in recent years a number of Protestant churches have been established.
There is also a small Muslim community in Dominica, and the nation's first mosque was built recently near Ross University.
Dominica is home to a wide range of people.
Although it was historically occupied by several native tribes, the Arawaks and Carib  territory on the east coast of the island.
They elect their own chief.
This mix of cultures has produced the current culture.Music and dance are important facets of Dominica's culture.
The annual independence celebrations display a variety of traditional song and dance.
Since 1997, there have also been weeks of Creole festivals, such as "Creole in the Park" and the " World Creole Music Festival ".Dominica gained prominence on the international music stage when in 1973, Gordon Henderson founded the group Exile One and an original musical genre, which he coined " Cadence-lypso ".
This paved the way for modern Creole music.
Other musical genres include " Jing ping " and " Cadence ".
Jing ping features the accordion and is native to the island.
Dominica's music is a melange of Haitian, Afro-Cuban, African and European traditions.
Popular artists over the years include Chubby and the Midnight Groovers, Bells Combo, the Gaylords, WCK , and Triple Kay.The 11th annual World Creole Music Festival was held in 2007, part of the island's celebration of independence from Great Britain on 3 November.
A year-long reunion celebration began in January 2008, marking 30 years of independence.Dominica is often seen as a society that is migrating from collectivism to that of individualism.
The economy is a developing one that previously depended on agriculture.
Signs of collectivism are evident in the small towns and villages which are spread across the island.The famed novelist Jean Rhys was born and raised in Dominica.
The island is obliquely depicted in her best-known book, Wide Sargasso Sea .
Rhys's friend, the political activist and writer Phyllis Shand Allfrey , set her 1954 novel, The Orchid House , in Dominica.Much of the Walt Disney film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest .Dominica's cuisine is similar to that of other Caribbean islands, particularly Trinidad and St Lucia.
Like other Commonwealth Caribbean islands, Dominicans have developed a distinct twist to their cuisine.
Breakfast is an important daily meal, typically including saltfish, dried and salted codfish , and "bakes", fried dough.
Saltfish and bakes are combined for a fast food snack that can be eaten throughout the day; vendors on Dominica's streets sell these snacks to passersby, together with fried chicken, fish and fruit and yogurt "smoothies".
Other breakfast meals include cornmeal porridge , which is made with fine cornmeal or polenta, milk and condensed milk and sugar to sweeten.
Traditional British-influenced dishes, such as eggs, bacon and toast, are also popular, as are fried fish and plantains .Common vegetables include Plantain , Tania , beef, and fish.
These are often prepared in stews with onions, carrots, garlic, ginger and herbs like thyme.
The vegetables and meat are browned to create a rich dark sauce.
Popular meals include rice and peas, brown stew chicken , stew beef, fried and stewed fish, and many different types of hearty fish broths and soups.
These are filled with dumplings, carrots and ground provisions.Dominica boasts one of the most competitive education systems in the Caribbean and perhaps, the West.
School is mandatory up to Secondary school.
After pre-school, pupils attend primary school for six, traditionally seven years, and were admitted into secondary school on the basis of a highly challenging Common Entrance Exam.
After five years the students took Internationally competitive General Certificate of Education  can be taken upon completion of two years of community college.
The island has its own state college , formerly named Clifton Dupignff spinners, Harbhajan is the second highest wicket-taker in Test history, behind Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka.
He is the third-highest Test wicket-taker among all Indians.
Harbhajan has been particularly successful against Australian batsman Ricky Ponting , taking his wicket on ten occasions in Test cricket.
In an interview in 2001, Harbhajan stated his ambition to become an all-rounder .
Harbhajan Singh Is also a useful lower-down the order batsman.
For Mumbai Indians he had made valuable 49 runs of 18 balls to guide the MI to a seemingly impossible win over the DC.

WIK-i-PEE-dee-ə ) is a multilingual , web-based , free-content encyclopedia project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on a model of openly editable content.
The name "Wikipedia" is a portmanteau of the words wiki  and encyclopedia .
Wikipedia's articles provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information.Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay.
Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism.
Users can contribute anonymously , under a pseudonym, or, if they choose to, with their real identity.The fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates are the five pillars .
The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines to improve the encyclopedia; however, it is not a formal requirement to be familiar with them before contributing.Since its creation in 2001, Wikipedia has grown rapidly into one of the largest reference websites , attracting 374 million unique visitors monthly as of September 2015  There are more than 70,000 active contributors working on more than 35,000,000 articles in 290 languages .
As of today, there are 4,985,952 articles in English .
Every day, hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world collectively make tens of thousands of edits and create thousands of new articles to augment the knowledge held by the Wikipedia encyclopedia.
People of all ages, cultures and backgrounds can add or edit article prose, references, images and other media here.
What is contributed is more important than the expertise or qualifications of the contributor.
What will remain depends upon whether the content is free of copyright restrictions and contentious material about living people , and whether it fits within Wikipedia's policies , including being verifiable against a published reliable source , thereby excluding editors' opinions and beliefs and unreviewed research .
Contributions cannot damage Wikipedia because the software allows easy reversal of mistakes and many experienced editors are watching to help ensure that edits are cumulative improvements.
Begin by simply clicking the Edit link at the top of any editable page!Wikipedia is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways.
Unlike printed encyclopedias, Wikipedia is continually created and updated, with articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years.
Older articles tend to be more comprehensive and balanced; newer articles may contain misinformation and/or unencyclopedic content.
Any article may contain undetected vandalism .
Awareness of this helps the reader to obtain valid information and avoid recently added misinformation .For more details on this topic, see History of Wikipedia .The English edition of Wikipedia has grown to 4,985,952 articles, equivalent to over 2,000 print volumes of the Encyclopædia Britannica .
Including all language editions, Wikipedia has over 34 million articles, equivalent to over 15,000 print volumes .Wikipedia was founded as an offshoot of Nupedia , a now-abandoned project to produce a free encyclopedia.
Nupedia had an elaborate system of peer review and required highly qualified contributors, but the writing of articles was slow.
During 2000, Jimmy Wales , founder of Nupedia, and Larry Sanger , whom Wales had employed to work on the project, discussed ways of supplementing Nupedia with a more open, complementary project.
Multiple sources suggested that a wiki might allow members of the public to contribute material, and Nupedia's first wiki went online on January 10, 2001.There was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a website in the wiki format, so the new project was given the name "Wikipedia" and launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com,
on January 15  were donated by Wales.
Other current and past Bomis employees who have worked on the project include Tim Shell , one of the cofounders of Bomis and its current CEO, and programmer Jason Richey.
The domain was eventually changed to the present wikipedia.org
when the not-for-profit Wikimedia Foundation was launched as its new parent organization, with the ".org" top-level domain denoting its non-commercial nature.In May 2001, a large number of non-English Wikipedias were launched—in Catalan , Chinese , Dutch , Esperanto , French , German , Hebrew , Italian , Japanese , Portuguese , Russian , Spanish , and Swedish .
These were soon joined by Arabic and Hungarian .
In September,  Polish was added, and further commitment to the multilingual provision of Wikipedia was made.
At the end of the year, Afrikaans , Norwegian , and Serbo-Croatian versions were announced.Anyone with Web access can edit Wikipedia, and this openness encourages inclusion of a tremendous amount of content.
About 73,000 editors—from expert scholars to casual readers—regularly edit Wikipedia, and these experienced editors often help to create a consistent style throughout the encyclopedia, following our Manual of Style .Several mechanisms are in place to help Wikipedia members carry out the important work of crafting a high-quality resource while maintaining civility .
Editors are able to watch pages and technically skilled persons can write editing programs to keep track of or rectify bad edits.
Where there are disagreements on how to display facts, editors often work together to compile an article that fairly represents current expert opinion on the subject.Main pages: Wikipedia:Copyrights and wmf:Trademark policy" Wikipedia " is a registered trademark of the not-for-profit Wikimedia Foundation , which has created a family of free-content projects that are built by user contributions.Most of Wikipedia's text and many of its images are dual-licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License .
Some text has been imported only under CC-BY-SA and CC-BY-SA-compatible license and cannot be reused under GFDL; such text is identified either on the page footer, in the page history or on the discussion page of the article that utilizes the text.
Every image has a description page that indicates the license under which it is released or, if it is non-free, the rationale under which it is used.Contributions remain the property of their creators, while the CC-BY-SA and GFDL licenses ensure the content is freely distributable and reproducible.
Text on Wikipedia is a collaborative work, and the efforts of individual contributors to a page are recorded in that page's history , which is publicly viewable.
Information on the authorship of images and other media, such as sound files, can be found by clicking on the image itself or the nearby information icon to display the file page , which includes the author and source, where appropriate, along with other information.Many visitors come to Wikipedia to acquire knowledge, while others come to share knowledge.
At this very instant, dozens of articles are being improved, and new articles are also being created.
Changes can be viewed at the Recent changes page and a random page at random articles .
Over 4,500 articles have been designated by the Wikipedia community as featured articles , exemplifying the best articles in the encyclopedia.
Another 22,000 articles are designated as good articles .
Some information on Wikipedia is organized into lists ; the best of these are designated as featured lists .
Wikipedia also has portals , which organize content around topic areas; our best portals are selected as featured portals .
Articles can be found using the search box on the top-right side of the screen.Wikipedia is available in languages other than English.
Wikipedia has more than two hundred and eighty languages , including a Simple English version, and related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and scientific reference sources, and a news service .
All of these are maintained, updated, and managed by separate communities, and often include information and articles that can be hard to find through other common sources.Wikipedia articles are all linked , or cross-referenced.
When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information.
Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead.
There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external websites and pages, reference material, and organized categories of knowledge which can be searched and traversed in a loose hierarchy for more information.
Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages, and further information available on our sister projects .
Additional links can be easily made if a relevant link is missing—this is one simple way to contribute.Main pages: Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia and Wikipedia:Citing WikipediaAs wiki documents, articles are never considered complete and may be continually edited and improved.
Over time, this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation of information.Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start: they may contain false or debatable information.
Indeed, many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argument, they gradually take on a neutral point of view reached through consensus .
Others may, for a while, become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time—months or years perhaps—to achieve better balanced coverage of their subject.
In part, this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article that they edit comprehensive.
However, eventually, additional editors expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage.
In addition, Wikipedia operates a number of internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach.
Usually, editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article.The ideal Wikipedia article is well written, balanced, neutral , and encyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable, verifiable knowledge.
An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have.
Our best articles are called Featured Articles , and our second best tier of articles are designated Good Articles .
However, this is a process and can take months or years to be achieved through the concerted effort of editors.
Some articles contain statements which have not yet been fully cited .
Others will later be augmented with new sections.
Some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded and, therefore, may be removed.While the overall trend is toward improvement, it is important to use Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source, since individual articles will, by their nature, vary in quality and maturity.
Guidelines and information pages are available to help users and researchers do this effectively, as is an article that summarizes third-party studies and assessments of the reliability of Wikipedia .Main article: Wiki is not paper , on Wikimedia Meta-Wiki .Wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias.
Wikipedia has a very low "publishing" cost for adding or expanding entries and a low environmental impact in some respects , since it never needs to be printed, although computers have their own environmental cost .
In addition, Wikipedia has wikilinks instead of in-line explanations and it incorporates overview summaries  with the extensive detail of full articles.
Additionally, the editorial cycle is short.
A paper encyclopedia stays the same until the next edition, whereas editors can update Wikipedia at any instant, around the clock, keeping articles abreast of the most recent events and scholarship.See also: Reliability of Wikipedia and Wikipedia:Researching with WikipediaWikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences all arise because it is open to anyone, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are written by consensus, according to editorial guidelines and policies.Wikipedia is open to a large contributor base, drawing a large number of editors from diverse backgrounds.
This allows Wikipedia to significantly reduce regional and cultural bias found in many other publications, and makes it very difficult for any group to censor and impose bias .
A large, diverse editor base also provides access and breadth on subject matter that is otherwise inaccessible or little documented.
A large number of editors contributing at any moment also means that Wikipedia can produce encyclopedic articles and resources covering newsworthy events within hours or days of their occurrence.
It also means that like any publication, Wikipedia may reflect the cultural, age, socio-economic, and other biases of its contributors.
There is no systematic process to make sure that "obviously important" topics are written about, so Wikipedia may contain unexpected oversights and omissions.
While most articles may be altered by anyone, in practice editing will be performed by a certain demographic  and may, therefore, show some bias.
Some topics may not be covered well, while others may be covered in great depth.Allowing anyone to edit Wikipedia means that it is more easily vandalized or susceptible to unchecked information, which requires removal.
See Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism .
While blatant vandalism is usually easily spotted and rapidly corrected, Wikipedia is more subject to subtle viewpoint promotion than a typical reference work.
However, bias that would be unchallenged in a traditional reference work is likely to be ultimately challenged or considered on Wikipedia.
While Wikipedia articles generally attain a good standard after editing, it is important to note that fledgling articles and those monitored less well may be susceptible to vandalism and insertion of false information.
Wikipedia's radical openness also means that any given article may be, at any given moment, in a bad state, such as in the middle of a large edit, or a controversial rewrite.
Many contributors do not yet comply fully with key policies , or may add information without citable sources.
Wikipedia's open approach tremendously increases the chances that any particular factual error or misleading statement will be relatively promptly corrected.
Numerous editors at any given time are monitoring recent changes and edits to articles on their watchlist .Wikipedia is written by open and transparent consensus—an approach that has its pros and cons.
Censorship or imposing "official" points of view is extremely difficult to achieve and usually fails after a time.
Eventually for most articles, all notable views become fairly described and a neutral point of view reached.
In reality, the process of reaching consensus may be long and drawn-out, with articles fluid or changeable for a long time while they find their "neutral approach" that all sides can agree on.
Reaching neutrality is occasionally made harder by extreme-viewpoint contributors .
Wikipedia operates a full editorial dispute resolution process, one that allows time for discussion and resolution in depth, but one that also permits disagreements to last for months before poor-quality or biased edits are removed.
A common conclusion is that Wikipedia is a valuable resource and provides a good reference point on its subjects.That said, articles and subject areas sometimes suffer from significant omissions, and while misinformation and vandalism are usually corrected quickly, this does not always happen.
Wikipedia is written largely by amateurs.
Those with expert credentials are given no additional weight.
Wikipedia is also not subject to any peer review for scientific, medical or engineering articles.
One advantage to having amateurs write in Wikipedia is that they have more free time on their hands so that they can make rapid changes in response to current events.
The wider the general public interest in a topic, the more likely it is to attract contributions from non-specialists.The MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes, thus information added to Wikipedia never "vanishes".
Discussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics.
Therefore, serious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously or thoughtfully advocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article.
As with any source, information should be checked.
A 2005 editorial by a BBC technology writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of cultural changes that are happening across all sources of information , and may lead to "a better sense of how to evaluate information sources".
Wikipedia disclaimers apply to all pages on Wikipedia.
However, the consensus in Wikipedia is to put all disclaimers only as links and at the end of each article.
Proposals to have a warning box at the beginning have been rejected.
Some do not like the way it looks or that it calls attention to possible errors in Wikipedia.Wikipedia, in common with many websites, has a disclaimer that, at times, has led to commentators citing these in order to support a view that Wikipedia is unreliable.
A selection of similar disclaimers from places which are often regarded as reliable  can be read and compared at Wikipedia:Non-Wikipedia disclaimers .
Wikipedia content advisories can also be found here .A downloadable "Editing Wikipedia guide" in PDF form written by the staff at the Wikimedia FoundationAnyone can contribute to Wikipedia by clicking on the Edit tab in an article.
Before beginning to contribute, however, read some handy helping tools such as the tutorial and the policies and guidelines , as well as our welcome page .
Creating an account offers many benefits .
It is important to realize that in contributing to Wikipedia, users are expected to be civil and neutral , respecting all points of view, and only add verifiable and factual information rather than personal views and opinions .
" The five pillars of Wikipedia " cover this approach and are recommended reading before editing.
Most articles start as stubs , but after many contributions, they can become featured articles .
Once the contributor has decided a topic of interest, they may want to request that the article be written .
Wikipedia has on-going projects , focused on specific topic areas or tasks, which help coordinate editing.The ease of editing Wikipedia results in many people editing.
That makes the updating of the encyclopedia very quick, almost as fast as news websites.Wikipedia uses a simple yet powerful page layout to allow editors to concentrate on adding material rather than page design.
Page aspects facilitated include:formatting elements and most world alphabets and common symbols, Most of which have simple formats that are deliberately very easy and intuitive.tab

This will take you to a new page with a text box containing the editable text of the page you were viewing.
In this box, you can type in the text that you want to add, using wiki markup to format the text and add other elements like images and tables.
You should then press thebutton to review your contributions for any errors.
When you have finished editing, you should write a short edit summary in the small field below the edit-box describing your changes before you press thebutton.
This will help others to understand the intention of your edit.

Depending on the page’s susceptibility to vandalism, according to its visibility or the degree of controversy surrounding the topic, this tab may not be shown for all users.
View history.
This tab allows readers to view the editors of the article and the changes that have been made.Wikipedia has robust version and reversion controls .
This means that poor-quality edits or vandalism can quickly and easily be reversed or brought up to an appropriate standard by any other editor, so inexperienced editors cannot accidentally do permanent harm if they make a mistake in their editing.
As there are many more editors intent on improving articles than not, error-ridden articles are usually corrected promptly.Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not , which summarizes what belongs in Wikipedia and what does not;Wikipedia:Neutral point of view , which describes Wikipedia's mandatory core approach to neutral, unbiased article-writing;Wikipedia:No original research , which prohibits the use of Wikipedia to publish personal views and original research of editors and defines Wikipedia's role as an encyclopedia of existing recognized knowledge;Wikipedia:Verifiability , which explains that it must be possible for readers to verify all content against credible external sources ;Wikipedia:Reliable sources , which explains what factors determine whether a source is acceptable;Wikipedia:Citing sources , which describes the manner of citing sources so that readers can verify content for themselves;And Wikipedia:Manual of Style , which offers a style guide—in general editors tend to acquire knowledge of appropriate writing styles and detailed formatting over time.The Wikipedia community is largely self-organising, so that anyone may build a reputation as a competent editor and become involved in any role s/he may choose, subject to peer approval.
Individuals often will choose to become involved in specialised tasks, such as reviewing articles at others' request, watching current edits for vandalism, watching newly created articles for quality control purposes, or similar roles.
Editors who believe they can serve the community better by taking on additional administrative responsibility may ask their peers for agreement to undertake such responsibilities.
This structure enforces meritocracy and communal standards of editorship and conduct.
At present a minimum approval of 75–80% from the community is required to take on these additional tools and responsibilities.
This standard tends to ensure a high level of experience, trust, and familiarity across a broad front of aspects within Wikipedia.A variety of software-assisted systems and automated programs help editors and administrators to watch for problematic edits and editors.
Theoretically all editors and users are treated equally with no "power structure".
There is, however, a hierarchy of permissions and positions , some of which are listed hereafter:Anyone can edit most of the articles here.
Some articles are protected because of vandalism or edit-warring, and can only be edited by certain editors.Anyone with an account that has been registered for four days or longer and has made at least ten edits becomes autoconfirmed, and gains the technical ability to do three things that non-autoconfirmed editors cannot:Many editors with accounts obtain access to certain tools that make editing easier and faster.
Few editors learn about most of those tools, but one common privilege granted to editors in good standing is " rollback ", which is the ability to undo edits more easily.Administrators  have been approved by the community, and have access to some significant administrative tools.
They can delete articles , block accounts or IP addresses, and edit fully protected articles.Bureaucrats are chosen in a process similar to that for selecting administrators.
There are not very many bureaucrats.
They have the technical ability to add or remove admin rights, approve or revoke " bot " privileges, and rename user accounts.The Arbitration Committee is analogous to Wikipedia's supreme court .
They deal with disputes that remain unresolved after other attempts at dispute resolution have failed.
Members of this Committee are elected by the community and tend to be selected from among the pool of experienced admins.Stewards are the top echelon of technical permissions.
Stewards can do a few technical things, and one almost never hears much about them since they normally only act when a local admin or bureaucrat is not available, and hence almost never on the English Wikipedia.
There are very few stewards.Jimmy Wales , the founder of Wikipedia, has several special roles and privileges.
In most instances, however, he does not expect to be treated differently than any other editor or administrator.Main pages: Wikipedia:Vandalism , Wikipedia:Dispute resolution , Wikipedia:Consensus , Wikipedia:Sock puppetry and Wikipedia:Conflict of interestWikipedia has a rich set of methods to handle most abuses that commonly arise.
These methods are well-tested and should be relied upon.Intentional vandalism can be reported and corrected by anyone.Unresolved disputes between editors, whether based upon behavior, editorial approach, or validity of content, can be addressed through the talk page of an article, through requesting comments from other editors or through Wikipedia's comprehensive dispute resolution process.Abuse of user accounts, such as the creation of " Internet sock puppets " or solicitation of friends and other parties to enforce a non-neutral viewpoint or inappropriate consensus within a discussion, or to disrupt other Wikipedia processes in an annoying manner, are addressed through the sock puppet policy .In addition, new users may initially find that their votes are given less weight by editors in some informal polls in order to prevent abuse of single-purpose accounts .As well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic edits, Wikipedia also has a full style and content manual and a variety of positive systems for continual article review and improvement.
Examples of the processes include peer review , good article assessment , and the featured article process , a rigorous review of articles that are intended to meet the highest standards and showcase Wikipedia's capability to produce high-quality work.In addition, specific types of article or fields often have their own specialized and comprehensive projects , assessment processes , and expert reviewers within specific subjects.
Nominated articles are also frequently the subject of specific focus on the neutral point of view noticeboard or in WikiProject Cleanup .Wikipedia uses MediaWiki software, the open-source program used not only on Wikimedia projects but also on many other third-party websites.
The hardware supporting the Wikimedia projects is based on several hundred servers in various hosting centers around the world.
Full descriptions of these servers and their roles are available on this Meta-Wiki page .
For technical information about Wikipedia, check Technical FAQ .
Wikipedia publishes various types of metadata ; and, across its pages, are many thousands of microformats .Wikipedia is run as a communal effort.
It is a community project whose result is an encyclopedia.
Feedback about content should, in the first instance, be raised on the discussion pages of those articles.
Be bold and edit the pages to add information or correct mistakes.Help:Menu —is a menu-style page that will direct you to the right place to find information.There is an established escalation-and-dispute process within Wikipedia, as well as pages designed for questions, feedback, suggestions, and comments.

He is a left-arm fast opening bowler and a right-handed batsman, Early life and familyBorn in Rotorua in 1989, Boult accompanied the New Zealand A team on their winter training tour in 2007.
He then travelled to Malaysia in February 2008 for the Under-19 World Cup.On 21 January 2009, Boult was selected for the New Zealand squad for the one-day series against Australia at just 19 years of age.
Boult only managed to play in the warm up game against the Prime Minister's XI and went wicketless of seven overs.
During the tour Boult was clocked as the fastest bowler touring with the New Zealand team with a highest speed of 143.3 km/h .Boult made his Test debut in the 2011–12 season, in the Second Test against Australia in Hobart , a match won by New Zealand by 7 runs, New Zealand's first test win in Australia since 1985 and their first test win over Australia since 1993.
He took four wickets in the match; additionally, he scored 21 runs in a tenth-wicket partnership with Chris Martin in the second innings.In 2012, Boult produced a string of strong performances with the ball against the West Indies, India and Sri Lanka to consolidate his position as Tim Southee 's new ball partner.
He carried this good form into 2013 when he took 19 wickets in 5 tests against England, including his best test match innings bowling figures of 6/68 at Eden Park in March.After suffering a side strain during New Zealand's final test match against England at Leeds, Boult returned to the New Zealand test side for a two test tour of Bangladesh.
Boult struggled in the hot and dry conditions, taking just 3 wickets and frenquently straying with his accuracy.
However, when back in home conditions against the touring West Indies, Boult swiftly returned to his best.
In the second test at the Basin Reserve Boult won man of the match after taking career best figures of 10 for 80 and completing a brilliant one-handed diving catch to his left to dismiss Dinesh Ramdin .
In the first innings of the second test on the same venue against India, Boult made another one-handed diving right-handed catch to dismiss Ajinkya Rahane .
He also had bowling figures of 4 for 146.In 2014 T20 series against West Indies, Boult's squad number switched from 8 to 18, a number previously worn by Mathew Sinclair .
In 2015, Boult received a Maiden call-up into the Indian Premier League by the Sunrisers Hyderabad and he was purchased for $600,000Bowling and fielding styleBoult is a left-arm fast medium swing bowler.
He makes up for his relative lack of height with deceptive pace and the ability to swing the ball both ways.
Boult's primary weapon is the inswinger to the right-hander.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, his childhood cricketing hero was Wasim Akram .
In 2013, in a radio interview, former New Zealand Captain Jeremy Coney rated Boult as New Zealand's best bowling discovery since Shane Bond.
He is also known to haul in one-handed catches with either hand, both in Basin Reserve .

Three different openers for India Shikhar Dhawan  made centuries in the series.
This was fifth time in Test history.
The last was happened in 1970 Ashes by John Edrich , Geoff Boycott and Brian Luckhurst for England.
India won the three-match series 2–1, and this was the first series win by India in Sri Lanka since 1993 .
This series win also gave India their first overseas Test series victory since the 2011 tour in the West Indies.1 Murali Vijay was ruled out of the first Test and also last Test due to a hamstring injury. 2 Stuart Binny was added to India's squad before the second Test. 3 Shikhar Dhawan was ruled out of the last two matches after fracturing his right hand in the first Test.
4 Wriddhiman Saha was ruled out of the last Test due to a hamstring injury.
Ravichandran Ashwin took his 11th five-wicket haul and first against Sri Lanka.
Ashwin's bowling figures of 6/46 is the best bowling figures by an Indian against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.
The first Test of the series was a close affair.
Sri Lanka, batting first, lost wickets at regular intervals to be bowled out for 183 just before tea on Day 1. India lost two wickets early, but consolidated their position.
With centuries from opener Shikhar Dhawan and captain Virat Kohli , they took a 192 run lead.
Sri Lanka in their second innings again started poorly.
However, a counter-attacking century from Dinesh Chandimal with support from Lahiru Thirimanne and Jehan Mubarak set India a target of 176.
Rangana Herath ripped through the Indian batting line up to take a 7 wicket haul and hand Sri Lanka the victory.Rain interrupted play twice during Sri Lanka's first innings on Day 3 and in the second innings on Day 5.
This was the last international match for Kumar Sangakkara , who retired from international cricket after this Test.
Amit Mishra  took his 50th Test wicket when he dismissed Dhammika Prasad in the first innings.
Ravichandran Ashwin  took his third conescutive five-wicket haul in Test matches.India brought in Murli Vijay for the injured Shikhar Dhawan and Stuart Binny for Harbhajan Singh and decided to bat first.
Vijay and Ajinkya Rahane departed early but a fighting century from KL Rahul and fifties from Kohli and Rohit Sharma got India to 393 in their 1st innings.
Sri Lanka again had a poor start but a 100+ partnership between Angelo Mathews and Lahiru Thirimanne took Sri Lanka to a strong position before a collapse, leaving India with a lead of 87 runs.
India in their 2nd innings consolidated their position with a century from Rahane and a 50 from an injured Vijay.
Sri Lanka in their second innings were bowled out for 134 runs to hand India their biggest win in Sri Lanka.
The Test marked the end of Kumar Sangakkara 's international career.Rain interrupted India's innings at 15 overs on Day 1 with no play was possible.
Rain also interrupted play in the 96th over of India's first innings on Day 2 with play being called off for the day.On Day 3 rain interrupted play in the 9th over of India's second innings with play being called off for the day.Naman Ojha  made their Test debuts.
This was 14th time that two wicketkeepers made their debuts in the same Test match.
Ishant Sharma  took his 7th five-wicket haul in Test matches.
His 5/54 are the best bowling figures by an Indian pace bowler in Sri Lanka .
He also became the 8th Indian overall and fourth Indian pace bowler to reach 200 Test wickets.
Dhammika Prasad  record his career best bowling figure by beat his previews in a Test match.
The match also became the lowest stand for opening partnerships by both teams in a three-Test series.Indian Ishant Sharma and three Sri Lankan Dinesh Chandimal , Dhammika Prasad , and Lahiru Thirimanne have been charged by the ICC for their roles in several angry exchanges during the match.Injury to Murli Vijay meant that India had their third different opening combination of the series.
However, the start was still poor and on back of an unbeaten century from Cheteshwar Pujara and a fifty from Amit Mishra India scored 312.
The Sri Lankan innings had a similar poor start and was reduced to 47/6 before debutant Kusal Perera and veteran Rangana Herath took Sri Lanka to 201.
India in their 2nd innings were reduced to 7/3 but successive 50+ run partnerships between Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and Stuart Binny meant India set a target of 384.
Sri Lanka had another poor start until Mathews and Perea joined forces and took Sri Lanka from 109/5 to 248.
Ashwin got the wicket of Perera after he was caught trying to reverse sweep which exposed the tail and led to India winning in the last session on the final day.
Ishant Sharma , for his agressive behavior was handed a one-match ban along with Dinesh Chandimal .
This victory marked India's 1st victory in Sri Lanka since 1993 and Kohli's 1st series victory as skipper.
Ashwin was named man of the series.^

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter CommentHe is known to work hard on the field but not get the wickets he seemingly deserves.
Harsh but true: it's because he doesn't bowl enough wicket-taking ballsIshant is expected to take over from Zaheer as the leader of India's attack but technical deficiencies hold him back © Getty ImagesWhat's the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ishant Sharma ?
I'm guessing it would be an image of a tall, young fast bowler coming off a long run-up ball after ball, giving his all for the team.
It is this quality that impressed me on India's wretched tour of England, where Ishant ran in with great zest and bowled long spells the whole day, with intensity - all in a losing cause.
When others around him were falling like ninepins, Ishant carried on gamely, day after day, showing the same passion for bowling in the last 20 minutes of the day as he did in the first 20.Such bowlers, who are ready to do the hard yards for the team, are a boon to a captain.
But there are bowlers of another kind that a captain would much prefer: bowlers who take wickets.
This is where Ishant has proved a disappointment so far; for all his talent and commitment he just does not take enough wickets.When I looked at Ishant's bowling record , it took me by surprise.
Until recently I hadn't bothered to look at his numbers, for there was so much to like about Ishant on the field that it did not matter what was on paper.Ishant has played 43 Tests at an average of 36.8.
That's right, the bowler India keep looking at as a bright young prospect, expected to take over the leadership role from Zaheer Khan, has already played 43 Tests.
Forty-three Tests makes you a seasoned Test player - a player for the present, not one for the future.
It's time Indian cricket started looking at Ishant that way, expecting results from him today instead of tomorrow.Let's now move to the other eye-catching number in his bowling record - the average.
Bowling averages somehow never get as much media- and mind-space as batting averages do.
When it comes to gauging the success of a player, it's simpler for fans to understand batting averages.
To give you a very rough estimate of Ishant's bowling average in batting parlance: an average of 36 runs per wicket is about equal to averaging just under 35 per innings for a batsman.
Would India be tolerant of a batsman who averaged around 35 after 43 Tests?
Ishant's strike rate of 64.8 is also below par.
This means he needs to bowl nearly 11 overs to get one wicket.Granted, India are not spoilt for choice when it comes to seam bowlers, but that Ishant has generally been an automatic pick in the playing XI and his bowling returns are never a talking point suggests we have all been slightly swayed by his demeanour on the field.
It is always "unlucky" Ishant, a bowler who deserves more wickets for his lion-hearted performance in the field.
"Unlucky Ishant Sharma" has become his brandname in Indian cricket today.But there is no such thing as an unlucky batsman or an unlucky bowler.
Over a short span, yes, but if someone is an "unlucky" bowler over a long period of time, he is simply not bowling enough wicket-taking balls.
And that is the simple truth about Ishant - he has just not bowled enough potential wicket-taking balls, and it reflects in his record.An average of 36 runs per wicket is equal to averaging just under 35 per innings for a batsman.
Would India be tolerant of a batsman who averaged around 35 after 43 Tests?Following a good series in the West Indies, where he picked up 22 wickets, his dry run resumed in England.
After Ishant had another fruitless day in the field in the recent home series against West Indies, I asked Courtney Walsh, a fellow panelist on a TV show, for his take on Ishant.
Walsh also bowled the same genre of seam as Ishant does, and he made an observation about what prevented Ishant from being a more potent wicket-taking bowler: the head falling away at the time of delivery, and the uncertain position of the wrist behind the ball when he lets it go were his two main deficiencies, Walsh said.
Of course, this is not the first time these aspects of Ishant's bowling have been pointed out, but it is sad to see that these two critical issues have remained largely unaddressed.All fast bowlers will tell you that the head falling away sideways at the time of delivery kills much of the speed, especially when the ball is pitched up.
It's an important reason why Ishant is never quick when he pitches the ball up, and why the yorker is not a real weapon for him.
This, along with his wrist action - where the two fingers on the seam tend to slide away rather than remain behind the seam when the ball is released - greatly diminishes the movement he would otherwise get in the air and off the pitch, and the zip.When he tries to get the ball into that full-length area, it just does not respond.
It reacts better when it's pitched shorter, which is why he feels compelled to bowl that length.
But when the ball is short you don't find the edges, the leg-befores and the bowleds, as often.
And that is what makes Ishant an "unlucky" bowler in Indian cricket.Very nice analysis.
It is a late assesment.
It would have helped if Sanjay did this a while ago and told Ishant about it.
Because, he hasn't been a wicket taking bowler for a long time.
However, there is no way Ishant is ever going to be dropped from the Indian team .
He is the only positive that has happened to the Indian cricket for the past 4 years.
Maybe we are witnessing another positive, Kohli, now.rsurya on January 14, 2012, 19:21 GMTIshanth is a pick of the worst lot and you can't expect more from him.

I just hate these kind of high talks from but given that opportunities which media is providing them every ex cricketer is coming with their expert comments.
Sanjay Manjrekar talks about commitments ..he was one of the most selfish batsman i have seen very much like dinesh karthick once in a one day match he didn't sacrifice his own wicket for tendulkar involved in run out misunderstanding ..everone knows that in any day tendulkar is far better than sanjay...i hate these loose talks from ex players they should not forget what they have done in their playing daysS.Jagernath on January 14, 2012, 17:44 GMTBrilliant article,a topic of which is of great importance to the future of Indian cricket.Ishant Sharma just does not bowl accurately enough to consistently cause problems.Ishant get a delivery or two each over that could create pressure but it is often followed up by a delivery on the pads or a high bouncer.Umesh Yadav took 5 wickets today but his economy was 5 as well,unless the Indian bowlers tighten their lines & lengths,they will spend many more long days out in the summer sun all over the world.on
January 14, 2012, 16:45 GMTIf bowler like vinay kumar can play for India, then Ishant deserves to bowl even though he does not pick wicket.UmarKhan85 on January 14, 2012, 14:45 GMT@ Vaibhav my friend your famed indian batting line up is only good at bashing oppositions on home soil.
this tour of australia is the umpteenth time your batting line up has flopped against seam swing and bounce.
and just to remind you Pakistan has one of the best fast bowlers currently playing for them who cant make the ball dance on dead wickets too.
I dont think you saw how we bowled on UAE wickets against sri lanka.
and even in the semi final, which too was played on a dead flat wicket, we managed to stop you at 260. so i say bring it on.
the Karachi test where irfan pathan took a hat-trick is yet another proof of how vulnerable you batters are on seaming pitches.
Therefore i suggest you advice ur cricket board to make your players learn how to play swing and bounce before saying u can just bash our bowling like anything.Rooboy on January 14, 2012,  3:09 GMTSharma would be better served in this test just to shut up and let his bowling do the talking.

He should be independently judged.They can even have something like have installation ready and train juniors in batches of 10.
Now these juniors can be from the IPL side and charge the franchises.
It will be win win situation for both IPL franchises  and for Indian team as they get better options.Anyways, in an IPL playing 11 there are 3 types of players a)International b) National Players from catchment areas, who are yet to make a mark.So these blokes from c can be trained easily and it would make sense in the IPL franchises to invest in them..with 3-5 year contract.DebashisCalcutta on January 13, 2012,  0:30 GMT@Shashi77  ... by you logic  , one can only analyze/criticize if he has scored more runs /taken more wickets than the person concerned ...so how come u r  questioning Sanjay?
My bad , you must have scored more runs than Sanjay..on January 13, 2012,  0:11 GMTIshant sharma ,morne morkel and steven finn all fall into same category tall,thin and fast bowlers who rely on pace and bounce !! Give a bouncy pitch to ishant the no one can cone close to him.if
u make him bowl on flat indian pitches what will u expect his strike rate to be ?? Indian team needs variety in the attack like zaheer relies on swing , umesh yadav on raw pace and yorkers and ishant relies on bounce and aaron bowls correct line and length with pace.
Praveen,vinay and irfan are like zak and can be ideal replacements for him.
But u cant kick out ishant just becoz he is not getting wickets.
He adds variety to the indian attack .
Look at south african attack for example steyn relies on pace and swing like zak but he is faser,morne morkel like ishant relies on bounce and philander has many variations and tsotsobe has raw pace like yadav with some swing.Luk at england attack - jimmy relies on swing like zak, broad relies on pace like yadav and finn relies on bounce !!on January 12, 2012, 23:52 GMTMight be true, but the suggestions made in this article made by Mr. Manjrekar contradict those he made in his last article , where he vociferously defended the natural actions of a bowler/batsman."I
shudder to imagine what would have happened to 14-year-old Brian Lara had he been shown a video of how high his back-lift was.
A 12-year-old Tendulkar shown a close-up of how his grip was wrong; a freeze-frame of Sehwag's still feet at the time of receiving a delivery.
Or a young Kapil shown his extremely side-on bowling action and told how it would surely destroy his lower back in the future unless he changed his bowling action.
Thank god these incredible talents were mostly left alone by their junior coaches.
For that the cricketing world shall be ever grateful to them."We should not forget it is not only the attitude but his devastating spells against top order batsmen  which brought him fame.Leggie on January 12, 2012, 21:42 GMTSurprise surprise... finally someone has noticed that Ishant cannot be an automatic choice.
Yes, his record is bad, and it'll do a world of good if he stops playing IPL and focuses on improving his bowling.
The article is spot on and Sanjay is right on the money.
Ishant in his current form cannot be the future of Indian cricket!rajwanii on January 12, 2012, 20:12 GMTwell...as far as ishant is concerned...i think he is anodar  overrated indian cricketer like ajit agarkar was wen he came in,like sehwag is,like kohli and raina are.... article is great,to the point and best part of it is its providing you with the technical problem and solution,and tells you how reckless dese indian bowlers are besides zaheer khan....umm09 on January 12, 2012, 16:54 GMTIshant is waste.
We do not need express fast bowlers, Magrath, Kapil Dev and other bowlers were not express fast but they used to bowl good line and length, most importantly wicket taking balls.
I feel India should look and bowlers like Praveen Kumar and Vinaykumar, they are not fast as others, but they are wicket taking bowlers.on
January 12, 2012, 15:50 GMT@ shashi 77 you can't handle the truth, typical indian mentality.
rather then appreciating snjay's honesty and no nonsense approach you are belittling him, in fact you are only showing your ignorance.
4-0 coming mate, enjoyon January 12, 2012, 11:23 GMTWith all due respect to Sanjay , Ishant is one among the many India bowlers who is average, not sure why this extra push for him !!!!
He is not taking wickets in bowling condition therefore an extra support may be ?on
January 12, 2012, 10:47 GMTPointing at someone's mistake is always easy.
Manjrekar just question urself first how much have u learnt from ur past mistakes.
Check ur career what it was.
I am not a fan of Ishant, learning curves vary from person to person and hope that Ishant will learn it one day.
I strongly feel almost every sports person in this world feels responsible while playing for their country, one thing that they need is a proper guidance when they are going through bad patches.on
January 12, 2012,  9:59 GMTHe is more worried about changing spellings in his name rather than working hard on his wrist and head positions..crap mentality he should go n work with Ekta kapoor in some serial he is more fit for that.here2rock on January 12, 2012,  6:06 GMTFast pitches mean it will prouces fast bowlers and good back foot players.
Dead dusty tracks mean it will proudce slow bowlers only good in these conditions and death for fast bowlers.
Batsman will struggle to make an adjustment from low bounce to high boucny pitches, the adjustment from high bounce to low bounce is a lot easier.
Unless the BCCI with all the money in the world does some thing with pitches back home then India won't have a good all round side.
It comes down to work ethics where bowlers are just required to take the shine off the ball for spinners it becomes too much of a task for them to bowl 20 overs in  day.DebashisCalcutta on January 12, 2012,  5:57 GMTAlas we have only one sanjay mangrekar !!!! we need to have more of these brutally honest commentators/analysts ..

As a fast bowler- if you can not bowl- Yorkers at consistet levels, bouncers, rising deliveries to chest & Body, bowl wicket to wicket, swing , turn- U R NOT A PLAYER FIT TO BE IN ANY NATIONAL TEAM.VickGower on January 12, 2012,  3:19 GMT@sashi77, if you actually read this article you will discover that in fact Manjrekar's diagnosis of Ishant is based on a conversation he had with Courtney Walsh and other fast bowlers!
Second, by your measure your own viewpoints on cricket and Manjrekar are null and void since neither are you a big fish in cricket nor do you have much of a record in cricket journalism or commentary.. Third, I wonder why you come at all to cricinfo, because I guarantee you most if not all journalists/writers here are not better than the players they report or comment on.jayamir
on January 12, 2012,  2:10 GMTManjrekar's articles are never written for the sake of it.
He always has a point!! Well said sir! Very true!
What happens to such bowlers is that they get knocked out when someone better shows up.

To me, the best pundit of them all.
There are one or two others who try to be as honest as possible, but Manjrekar is a complete package.
He speaks as he sees it, and what he sees and speaks always strikes a chord with me.
I have to confess I did not expect he would be as good as he has turned out.
It is not simply that Manjrekar is not afraid to criticize  are measured and thoughtful.
One gets the feeling that Manjrekar is trying to *apply* his brain to the cause, rather than just mouth off.
With Ganguly I always get the impression that he has an axe to grind, that his criticisms are slanted by his prejudices.
I really, really hope he becomes more of a permanent fixture in the commentary box.cric_frank on January 11, 2012, 21:59 GMTAny cricketer or a sportsman evolves by improving and working at his game gradually.As someone pointed out,he and Steyn came together on the scene & well,the gulf is gigantic enough..Also I remember one time when Ishant ignored a legendary fast bowler's advice that he should fill in and gain a bit more weight to avoid the head falling over or something of that sort and our Mr.know-it-all said that he is fit enough blah blah..the arrogance of some of our players is not just disgusting but utterly annoying, I gnaw my teeth in anger when I see this type of attitude when legends like Dravid & Sachin maintain the work ethic diligently..Ishant reminds me of an animal that runs without using its head on the African Serengeti plains..starts with Z,I know cricinfo wont publish if I complete it ;)Shashi77 on January 11, 2012, 21:33 GMTLets dissect Manjrekar's test record...someone who is always obsessed with technique in 37 test matches scored 2043 at an average of 37.14.If i discounted that pakistan tour where he scored 569 runs with highest individual score of 218 on a placid dead wicket of lahore n one inning in zimbabwe where he scored century his average drops to 25.37.
Played 5 test matches on aus 1991-92 tour scored 197 runs at an average of 21.88.
According to me he played only one quality inning at barbados in 37 test matches.

The latter guy is a consistent +145kmh bowlers.
While I dont have to say much about the former...on January 11, 2012, 17:51 GMTI respect Manjrekar, for his let-truth-be-told stance.
I know he has not got much following in India, simply because Indians likes to read what they wish to be read.
A well articulated and stat-backed article, loved it!TRAM on January 11, 2012, 17:41 GMT@Ravi Darira,  you asked "Manjrekar - what is your record, capability"...
If Ravi Shastri & Gavaskar can comment about fielding, especially diving stops on the boundary line, why not Manjrekar about fast bowling?
And what about Harsha Bogle?
He should not talk cricket at all, right?
The unfortunate truth is that a critic/commentator do not need to be an expert himself !
There is no college that offers a 'Degree in Cricket commentary'.uncanny_nanny

No one stops Ishant from talking to senior / legend bowlers of other countries... May be language or shyness or ego problem.
2. Indian bowling coaches themselves may be unfit for their job.
Either the coach doesn't know much or he is not willing to teach or not capable of teaching well.
But does BCCI officials have the capacity to evaluate coaches?on
January 11, 2012, 16:08 GMTSanjay, there is a flaw in logic when you say we are intolerant of batsmen with batting average under 35.
We are intolerant because we have a great lineup of batsmen.
Ishant is in the team because there is simply no one who is better.Dravid_Pujara_Gravitas on January 11, 2012, 15:28 GMT@Ravi Darira, if Ravi Darira and Dravid_Gravitas can comment on Dravid and Sachin respectively, Sanjay can sure comment on any player.
Let us know how Sanjay is wrong or right rather than questioning whether he should be commenting or not.
Through this article, Sanjay did a great service to Indian Cricket by giving inputs about technical problems rather than lurking into the murky waters of drop him or select him.
Sanjay did exactly what we expect him to do - give inputs about technical issues rather than selection issues.
I hope he one day comes out with a piece on Dhoni's horrible captaincy and leaves it at that.
Of course, it will be a bonus if he asks Dhoni to be dropped from Tests.
But this particular piece is a master stroke from Sanjay - doing his part responsibly as a former Indian Cricketer in bringing forward the role of technical issues behind meagre returns.
Can't agree more with Sanjay.Empty-Sequence on January 11, 2012, 15:11 GMTEric Simmons should have been replaced when Kristen left the team.
This is destroying the limited fast bowling talent that we have.
Even Prasad was better coach than him.
Totally agree with Dinker Rkn- He is india's Troy Cooley.on
January 11, 2012, 14:51 GMTThe problem is in the way he has been coached.
If u look at his bowling till 2009,but throughout the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India,he bowled on wickets with no assistance for pace at all,still he managed to rip off beauties..& thus was fittingly given the Man of the Series award.
I think Eric Simmons is kind of making all new young talents as mediocre,he wants to make them swing bowlers,& not every1 has the capability to be one.For me,Ishant is a bowler who should be in the league of Morne Morkel,not in the league of McGrath.
It's high time we replace Eric with some1 who has played International Cricket as a pacer successfully.on
January 11, 2012, 14:42 GMTGood article and it reminds me a lot of Mohammad Sami.
When he first burst onto the scene he had great success early on and was heralded as the next big thing after Wasim, Waqar and Shoaib.
He was quick  that it doesn't compute for a guy who can bowl in 140s consistently to have an average above 40.
I think what Sanjay is describing here would have applied to Sami as well.
I'm not really comparing  the two since they are different types of bowlers but the fact that watching them play you would think they are pretty good bowlers but their stats don't add up.
At least Ishant is still young and has time to get better so hopefully he can do something at Perth.
Best of luck to indian fans.AidanFX on January 11, 2012, 14:26 GMTManjrekar - what is your record, capability that you are allowed to comment about Ishant Sharma, VVS Laxman, etc?Dravid_Pujara_Gravitas on January 11, 2012, 14:07 GMTExcellent observations Sanjay.
Glad you realised and touched this point, though a bit late.
So, when will you realise and make everybody understand that it's Dhoni but not VVS who needs to go from the Indian Test Team?
Or is it just impossible or too nerve wracking to talk the obvious against Dhoni?
I don't get the attitude of all you writers except Monga who came up with a piece against Dhoni's horrible captaincy.
I will wait for a piece from you Sanjay on Dhoni.
You generally make good comments and yes you were also brave in calling out Sachin in the past.
Sachin improved and came out is a different matter.
You called a spade a spade.
Likewise, a guy like you should have realised by now that it's Dhoni who is the one responsible for our team's downturn and not VVS or the other two oldies.indianpunter
on January 11, 2012, 13:05 GMTthats such a superb point and so well elucidated, sanjay.
wonder what our bowling coach is doing?
Ishant has played as many tets as Dale Steyn !
where is Steyn, where is Ishant?ether0505 on January 11, 2012, 12:40 GMTWhile the analysis by Sanjay is largely correct, what he should also touch on is the overkill of cricket.
When you look at exciting new fast bowlers in cricket today, whether it is Cummins or Pattinson from Australia or Finn from England or De Lange from SA, all of them have their boards behind them, rationing their exposure and nurturing them to become great fast bowlers.
Where is the time in India?
BCCI is pushing the players into playing some or the other match every week.
A bowler needs time  change their attitude radically.
IPL is killing Indian cricket.fudgys11 on January 11, 2012, 12:30 GMTThe basic problem of this team is Dhoni.
When you know that  your fast bowler is not producing edges, what is the point of keeping 3 slips and deep fielders on the leg side.
You have to make the Batsmen try difficult things at the risk of giving some runs but creating chances atleast.
Make Ishant sharma bowl to his strength of off-middle line and try to take wickets.
He is trying to bowl outside off and going too wide mostly.
What he needs to do is pack off-side, mid -on  and make the batsmen play across his pads.
Keep fine-leg short which encourages batsmen to either try fine glance or hit across the line.on
January 11, 2012, 12:24 GMTbowling coach ?? first India should prepare fast bouncy pitches.. then experience teaches you everything..

Wonder if Eric Simmons agrees with it?TheOnlyEmperor on January 11, 2012, 11:28 GMTEven when technical defficiencies in the bowling action is brought out by other bowlers far more skilled, nobody seems concerned to address them on priority.
If a batsman gets repeatedly bowled, he doesn't get too many chances to correct his mistake.
Why then should a bowler be allowed to commit the same mistakes over several years?
It's the Indian attitude towards achieiving excellence in sports that must change!podichetty on January 11, 2012, 11:08 GMTThen for what ERIC SIMONS being paid for ?KricketWicket on January 11, 2012, 10:44 GMTIshant is not unlucky.
It is just that Ishant is not smart enough.
He is akin to a tube light that keeps on flicking, giving the impression that it is just about to spring to full light, but never does.

Bring back Irfan Pathanvineetkarthi on January 11, 2012,  9:38 GMTWhat India desperately needs is a bowler-Captain, someone like Kapil Dev who can inspire and guide his bowlers on the right lines and lengths to bowl.
One of the striking and frustrating aspects of Ishant's bowling is the low number of balls he makes a batsman play per over - effectively sacrificing a lot of energy and letting batsmen become comfortable at the crease.
Contrast with all the truly great bowlers  who were at the batsmen all the time, asking questions, as they say.on
January 11, 2012,  9:23 GMTThen what does our bowling coach analyzing and what kind of input given to him.

January 11, 2012,  8:31 GMTnothing but an overrated bowler.. tell me one spell of his other than the much-spoken spell against ricky ponting... he does not pick wickets even in the ipl..ansram on January 11, 2012,  7:45 GMTIdeally you need at least one sub 25 bowler to be a team that can take 20 wickets consistantly.
If you have two such  bowlers, you are likely to win many matches.
In these day of batting dominance .
you need at least one sub 27-28 bowler.
Only Zaheer has come anywhere close and has been particularly impressive in the last four years at about 25-26.
At this rate, Ishant would not get into any top bowling team, except perhaps Bangladesh, Zimbabwe or SL.MasterClass on January 11, 2012,  7:18 GMTSanjay, going by your own words  you're suggesting that a Sreesanth is preferable to an Ishant.....ummmm I think NOT! LOL!rkannancrown on January 11, 2012,  7:17 GMTSanjay manjrekar has failed to highlight a third issue - Ishant is doing what his captain wants.
Dhoni's style is defensive & Ishant bowls defensively.
He rarely has Dhoni telling him to go all out with 4-5 close in fielders.
The number of edges going where there is no fielder is generally been evident in both England & Australia.MasterClass on January 11, 2012,  7:07 GMTPeople, please read the article about Siddle who had the same predicament .
And that's what Ishant is capable of becoming once he finds that perfect length.
Although, I also hope he keeps his back-of-length in-dipping or straightening delivery as well since that is simply unplayable!
At 23 he has plenty of time to grow and improve, and India would be extremely FOOLISH to discard him.cric_san
on January 11, 2012,  6:55 GMTI completely agree with Sanjay, and also I would like to re iterate in other terms which I observed Ishanth's bowling while playing against AUS during 1st and second test.
1.
He does not bowl consistent line.
2.
He does not swing either new ball or old ball much.
My advice to Ishanth's bowling is 1.
If he wants to bowl Yorkers then I have one suggestion is to try and see the base of all three stumps at the time of delivering ball.
Believe me this allows you bowl pin point Yorkers.
I know this technique when I used to play cricket and I did the same and by doing so I bowled lot of batsmen.
2. My second advise for him to try to bowl slower once a lot especially in tests.
These slower once fool batsmen.
As a fan of Indian cricket, I want to see our bowlers take lots of wickets, hence a perfect match for our batsmen.on
January 11, 2012,  6:48 GMTBrilliant analysis Sanjay!
What Ishant is lacking is no rocket-science.
He is not pitching enough to induce edges, lbws and bold outs.
Why he was not doing so was understandable for me because he has been taken apart by the batsmen in the last couple of years and has been quite expensive.
So he is bowling defensive lines which doesn't makes you a front-line bowler.
If you see the current success of the Aussies young gones along with Siddle, their bowling coach is asking them only one thing - Pitch it Fuller!
When McGraw retired, a reporter asked him the secret of his success and he said it is really simple - Always try to hit the top of off-stump.
Now this is brilliance in this sentence.
This length will make it good length just a touch fuller hence not drivable.Ishant might become expensive again but he has to focus on taking wickets first not leaking runs.
Zaheer is not going to be there for ever!nikrik on January 11, 2012,  6:44 GMTIf a man with a sword is attacked by a snake and a dog at the same time ,he would surely have one go at the dog and take evasive action from the snake.If he is attacked by two snakes in tandem ,the possibility of success against one snake in one go is only 20% and by the time he has a second go at the snake the other snake would have bitten him.
Yes this was indeed true during the last tours to S Africa in 2007 & 2010 and also to england in 2007 when India had two good seamers  w ho could swing the new ball & old ball both ways at good pace and the captains let them to be  aggressive.Without one the success of the other is limited as exposed in England in 2011 and now in Australia.The batsmen in all these tours normally scored around 300 runs and the opposing teams even less.BCCI and the selectors did not care to keep them free from injury and focussed for the tours of Engl/Aust 2011 and the results showon January 11, 2012,  6:40 GMTThere is nothing new.... i wonder how it took so long for a commentator to notice this???
It comes without saying that an average of 36 after 40 matches is nothing to boast about.
However when analysing Indian fast bowlers we need to take in to account the number of matches played in India and abroad.
Indian pitches can kill a fast bowler.In Ishant's case he is neither getting wickets in India nor in favorable conditions like England/Australia.
We need a good coach for Ishant, because he has the height, stamina and the paceon January 11, 2012,  6:24 GMT"When I looked at Ishant's bowling record, it took me by surprise" seriously ?
us cricket fans have been aware he has been a consistent failure.Surely you could have used statsguru to realise he is a mediocre bowler.
His Strike rates in  Aus ,Eng ,SA & NZ  are 113,94,79, & 71 respectively.inswing
on January 11, 2012,  6:09 GMTRight on.
On the previous Aus tour, Sharma was extolled for troubling Ponting, but his average on that tour was something like 75.
People still talk about it like it was something earth shattering.
On this tour, he is averaging the same, around 75.
I think the reason behind this is that there is such a lack of fast bowling talent in India, that people get excited over _any_ little achievement.
Beat someone a couple of times, bowl one ball at 145 kmph, that's all it takes.
People get childishly excited that their bowler as able to do that.
But Sharma's actual performance puts him in Madan Lal and Ghavri category, below 'mediocre'.
It is time to stop praising him without reason, give someone else a chance.
India may not have any great bowlers, but they could well have someone who could average 30-32.crikbuff
on January 11, 2012,  6:01 GMTWonderful observations by Sanjay.
But what have the bowling coaches been doing all these years?
Ishant has worked with Venkatesh Prasad, Wasim Akram, among others.
Have none of them made any suggestions and worked on Ishant's bowling action, line&length, etc.
The bowling coaches must be accountable!on

Sami .deepak_sholapurkar on January 11, 2012,  5:58 GMTIn 2001 series I believe Javagal Srinath was treated like an unlucky bowler.
With lot's of misses and great looking delieveries but he was not getting wickets.
and every one was commenting that how unlucky Srinath is."Allen Border" commented on that, "if a Bowler is Pitching little short then he looks unlucky.
His delieveries can look devastating, and can beat the batsman.
But they will not fetch wickets."
By pitching short ball will not swing and gives the Batsman extra time(It may swing after passing Batsman and create a good looking delievery but not the wicket taking"I believe this is case for Ishant SharmaCool_Jeeves on January 11, 2012,  5:53 GMTEvery word is intelligently written.

One of the very few recent articles which has been so direct to the point, accurate and frank in assessment as well as finishes of with useful suggestions to the young bowler.
Sanjay is undoubtedly one of the best from cricketing fraternity when it comes to cricket writing.on
January 11, 2012,  5:19 GMTMr.
Manjrekar, being an experienced commentator, it would be nice, in the future, if you look at peoples record before going on and on about them on air.
The fact that you titled this article as "The Truth about Ishant" reflects that this is some sort of revelation.
Well, this may be a revelation for you, however if you look at his career graph, at no point in his career, has Ishant ever averaged under 30.
He has not shot out sides in any conditions, whether home or away.
Even Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad, who were not rated as the best test bowlers way back in 1996 when even you were in the team bowled consistently better than he has at any time in his career.
In tests you need bowlers who can bowl consistent line and length  and not bowl on both sides of the wicket, and give a 4 ball every over.
Just like batting requires patience and planning, so does bowling require the same and tests, and sadly limited overs cricket has ruined that aspect of our cricket also.mowgliworld on January 11, 2012,  5:11 GMTHello, Some stats.
Clearly, India never had a strike bowler with good strike rates.
Srinath and Kapil had good averages which means they pegged away economically to get wickets... Dale Steyn is KING!Paddle_Sweep on January 11, 2012,  5:02 GMTYou have hit the nail on its head.
We need players who can perform today rather than those 'evergreen promising' players.Aubm on January 11, 2012,  4:59 GMTThe rhetorical question you ask "Would India be tolerant of a batsman who averaged around 35 after 43 Tests?" is a rather humerous one, because that is almost exactly Yuvraj Singh's stats , yet he still seems to get recalled all the time.akshay_Yusuf on January 11, 2012,  4:56 GMTHelo manje : one point u missed and its a very important point.It sthe Captaincy and field placement by Dhoni.For a bowler like ishant u need to have slip wider 3 rd slip is mandatory .But he fails to do it often, so the dges goes by and dhoni is the guy who spoiled his line by asking him to bowl leg side with leg slip on.But aside dhoni's captaincy ishant must not bowl too short and wider.But its the responsibility of captain to use the talent to a greater extent .Ishant is not unlucky, he was made to be an unlucky bowler by his captainOkyaBokya on January 11, 2012,  4:45 GMTSpot on.
Last para sums up all.
He just keeps on bowling short length.
That too is wayward.
He bowls many deliveries down the log side.
He is almost as tall as Pattinson if not built.
Why can t he bowl consistently on the lengths where patts is bowling.
Why o why...Just played and miss wont count...its wicket column will.
Morne Morkel is suffering the same way as Ishant.sharath099 on January 11, 2012,  4:44 GMTGood observations.
Ishant's fortunes reminds me of Javagal Srinath!
In his first 5 yrs of intl cricket - Srinath was also hugely rated but had an ave of 36+ in tests.
It was only in latter half of his career that he bowled fuller lengths n got more wickets and finished with an ave of around 30. Lets hope Ishant can make a similar turn-around.Sheela on January 11, 2012,  4:36 GMTReally heartening to read from a critic about techncal aspects of bowling.

January 11, 2012,  4:32 GMTIshant should basically bowl the three fourth's length and not the full or shorter delivery to get wickets.
These were the deliveries which troubled Ponting down under last time and will do so with other right-handers , the ball nagging in.He has a tendency to bowl short when the pitch offers bounce and with his wrist position it comes at juicy pace for the Batsmen who are used to playing on the back foot.
With his height the three fourth deliveries will come right into the grey corridor of the Batsmen and will fetch up more wickets.
Indians missed the Bus when they kept bowling short to Ponting in the first test until which time, he was struggling to find form.rohan024
on January 11, 2012,  4:31 GMTSanjay Manjrekar deserves a round of applause for coming up with an interesting and insightful article on Ishant Sharma.
While most writers spend hours and days eulogizing Sachins and Dravids of India, here is an article talking about a genuine issue with a hard working fast bowler..Hope, Ishant's technical issues get addressed..Cricophilia on January 11, 2012,  4:28 GMTI couldn't agree more with this article.
Ishants sideways head movement was even more obvious when he had long hair.
He still manages to get the speed though but because he is not hitting the seam enough, the ball isn't moving as much as it should.
That is something the Aussies are good at.
The pitch at WACA is going to be a real opportunity for Ishant to shine.
But that being said, these technical snags in his bowling action need to be resolved, and the best way to do it is what CA did to both Peter Siddle and Hilfenhaus, and look at the results!
There has to be a threat to a bowlers position in the team or else we could be looking at another Harbhajan, who took his position for granted and did not evolve as a bowler.
But the toughest question of them all, why does the BCCI take so long in finding replacements?on
January 11, 2012,  4:28 GMTWell, to me is a mentally fragile bowler.
He looks defeated when things are not going his way.
It is not luck that should define wickets but skill and will!
He showed a lot of promise early on in his career but now he seems to be like Sehwag  in terms of thinking he is there to stay khushy always.
He bowled okay in Melbourne while Zaheer and Yadav bowled great.
Zaheer in fact was unlucky in the 1st innings in Melbourne.
But come Sydney, both Ishant and Yadav faltered badly and that cost us.
He also should have opened with Zaheer.
Maybe it was Dhoni's dumb idea of bouncing them which led to their bowling look bad!
Anyway, Manj is right in saying, 43 test old player should be already playing with a lot of skill.
He showed utter defeat on his face in Sydney.
And when he got a wicket, he still wasnt pumped up!  Wonder what is wrong with Praveen Kumar.
I think India need him badly to pair up with Zaheer.HatsforBats on January 11, 2012,  4:20 GMTIf his technical flaws are so obvious why aren't the coaching staff fixing them?
He's a bit like Flintoff in that he doesn't get as many wickets as he should, he beats the bat a lot but it's usually back of a length, he really does need to just pitch it up.
Also, he may have played 43 test matches but he's still just 23; India should stick with him and help him improve.Jerseyite on January 11, 2012,  4:18 GMTI have noticed this a long, long time back.
Ishant Sharma has not been able to get the ball back into the right hander at all, something which he effortlessly and prodigiously was able to do four years ago, nowhere as prominent as in Perth, the venue of the next test match.The reason this started with Ishant, was that he started listening to all kinds of idiots and taking in wrong advice.
He started to try and get the outswinger going which was never his stock taking delivery.
Given the prodigious amount of inswing and cut that Ishant was able to achieve, he never needed the outswinger.
He could bowl the ball that straightened and that was a deadly delivery as a certain Ricky Ponting found out on that day in Perth four years ago.
Obviously crappy tournaments like IPL which weren't there at the time of India's last tour to Australia, and which are there now, have done terrible amount of disservice to Ishant Sharma's bowling.
I predict Ishant Sharma to bow of test match cricket soonNaniIndCri on January 11, 2012,  4:17 GMTThat is a good observation and I too see Ishanth is not at all consistent in a over.
Especially in test cricket, bowler needs to work out a batsman over a spell and one can do it only by being consistent in line and length which Ishanth is not good atPercy_Fender on January 11, 2012,  4:17 GMTUseful observations indeed.But I thought we had a bowling coach by the name Eric Simmons.
I am surprised that he has not been able to sort out the aforementioned problems of Ishant.
I think Simmons has to go.
He is a better general coach than a bowling specific one.satchander
on January 11, 2012,  4:11 GMTAs Sanjay himself pointed out the technical deficiencies such as "wrist not being positioned correctly" and "head falling aside" are well known issues with Ishant.
Unlike Zaheer, he really cannot bowl outswingers at will.
He himself had said in one interview that he never knows if the ball he is going to bowl will be an inswinger  outswinger - i think this statement is enough to show Ishant's incapability as a fast bowler.
The only positive aspect about his bowling is that he is one of the few indian pace bowlers who can cross 140 kph consistently - otherwise he probably would have been sidelined a long time ago.
Honestly, the bench strength is not looking good enough for Ishant to be dropped.
With Praveen/Varun missing due to injuries and Vinay/Mithun hardly putting in any good performances in the tour games, Ishant will continue to be the first choice pace bowler for India.Jerseyite on January 11, 2012,  4:10 GMTThis is a superb column.
Sanjay Manjrekar is really rising slowly with his superb analysis, commentary and excellent writing.LillianThomson on January 11, 2012,  4:05 GMTIshant might still take wickets at Perth.
Ishant's Great Illusion against Ponting last time was at Perth, as was Mitch Johnson's destruction of England last year.
Tall and quick but technically flawed bowlers can capitalise on the extra bounce there.
But at the end of the day, I disagree with Manjrekar's equation of a bowling average of 37 with a batting average of 35.
Only in India.
Ishant's bowling average of 37 equates to a batsman overseas with an average of around 25.
He just isn't anywhere close to Test class.Sir_Harry_Flashman on January 11, 2012,  4:00 GMTGreat analysis.
Ishant's career has several parallels to Stuart Broad's.
Both positioned as a potential bowling unit leaders, both given time to mature and develop and both facing issues to address to achieve 'world class' status.
The difference is that Broad's early deficiencies, namely an appetite for short pitch bowling that didn't yield wickets seems to have been solved.
I think Broad now realises that he can be a top line and length bowler with a good occasional short ball, rather than an enforcer with little in the way of consistent line and length.
Yet, Ishant's need for consistency hasn't yet been overcome leading to the 'unlucky' tag that Manjrekar mentions.
Perhaps competition is the difference?
Broad is surrounded by many contenders for his position; Sharma is an automatic pick.
It's difficult to solve as a crop of fast bowling talent to challenge Sharma isn't there, but the issue must be addressed if we're ever to talk of him in the same breath of other quick Indian greats.RandyOZ on January 11, 2012,  3:53 GMTGood analysis by Sanjay.
Glad to see someone is taking note.SouthPaw on January 11, 2012,  3:45 GMTWow Sanjay, this is easily your best piece!
Fantastic objectivity and clear analysis.
Congrats and keep it up!baskar_guha on January 11, 2012,  3:39 GMTFinally, Mr. Manjrekar is talking about bowlers.
About time.
It is my view that the young batting guns of India need "air cover" by way of strike bowlers.
That is why Australia and England can introduce new batsmen  and have them "grow and adapt" without being noticed and India can't because of the paucity of strike bowlers.fanonfire on January 11, 2012,  3:33 GMThe always remind me of sami pakistani bowler.
both bowls almost at the same speed, both work very hard  but cant take wickets.
it is sad to seeNatx on January 11, 2012,  3:23 GMTFor the first time on cricinfo, some useful comments and advise from Manjrekar than simply criticizing or offering insights to selectors and captain on who needs to be in the team and who is not.
This is way better in folks understanding their limitations and improve.
Hope Ishant learn a point or two from listening to the folks like Walsh.
It is even better to request Wasim Akram to spend few hours on nets, who is in Australia and always has been a good mentor to fast bowlers.
But listening to the greats is one thing and what is being implemented on the field is the other.
I was listening to Wasim's comments the other day and he was pointing out these mistakes clearly.
Hope these guys pay attention to the seniors and learn a point or two.
Even trying to keep it simple like zaheer is effective by bowling a good line and length instead of bowling 150+ kph.
If he quickly make these corrections, he stands a chance to repeat his Perth magic again.akshay1994
on January 11, 2012,  3:20 GMTThanks a ton.
My thoughts exactly, I'm sick of hearing commentators say "he was unlucky not to pick up a few more wickets".
You can't be unlucky for so long.
Good article, completely to the truth.Venkatb on January 11, 2012,  3:04 GMTHaving watched bowlers like Hall and Griffith and several notables since then, I have sporadically watched cricket as I live in the US.
I did have the opportunity to watch Ishant Sharma and what bothers me, besides the statistics, is his delivery stride - as he approaches the crease, his eyes are not at or towards the batsman, rather he is trying to get his last ounce of energy to bowl fast - he needs to focus on length and accuracy, essentially become a stock bowler than a pace bowler that he is not.
And yes, a world class bowler has a lifetime average below 23 - no Indian bowler has ever come anywhere close!on
January 11, 2012,  2:57 GMTAlthough I don't particually enjoy watching or following Indian cricket, I agree that Sharma does bring a lot of determination and optimism that India so desperatly needs.on

India pick Gurkeerat for ODIs, Aravind for T20IsThe Indian cricket team, also known as Team India and Men in Blue, is the national cricket team of India .
Governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India  status.Although cricket was introduced to India by European merchant sailors in the 18th century, and the first cricket club in India was established in Calcutta in 1792, India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord's , becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status.
In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played.
The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as batsmen Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath , all-rounder Kapil Dev and the Indian spin quartet .Traditionally much stronger at home than abroad, the Indian team has improved its overseas form since the start of the 21st century, winning Test matches in Australia , England and South Africa .
It has won the Cricket World Cup twice – in 1983 under the captaincy of Kapil Dev and in 2011 under Mahendra Singh Dhoni's captaincy.
After winning the 2011 World Cup, India became only the third team after West Indies and Australia to have won the World Cup more than once,  and the first cricket team to win the World Cup at home.
It has won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy , under the captaincy of Dhoni.
It was also the joint champions of 2002 ICC Champions Trophy , along with Sri Lanka .As of 10 July 2015, the Indian cricket team is ranked fifth in Tests, second in ODIs and second in T20Is by the ICC .
Virat Kohli is the current captain of the team in Tests while Dhoni is the ODI and T20I captain.
The Indian cricket team has rivalries with other Test-playing nations, most notably with Pakistan , the political arch-rival of India.
However, in recent times, rivalries with nations like Australia, England and South Africa have also gained prominence.Main article: History of the Indian cricket teamSee also: History of cricket in India to 1918 , History of cricket in India from 1918–19 to 1945 , History of cricket in India from 1945–46 to 1960 , History of cricket in India from 1960–61 to 1970 , History of cricket in India from 1970–71 to 1985 , History of cricket in India from 1985–86 to 2000 and History of cricket in India from 2000–01Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji Jadeja was an Indian who played for the English cricket teamThe British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721.
India was invited into The Imperial Cricket Council in 1926, and made their debut as a Test playing nation in England in 1932 , led by CK Nayudu , who was considered as the best Indian batsman at the time.
India recorded their first Test victory, in their 24th match, against England at Madras  in 1952.
They continued their improvement throughout the early 1950s with a series win against New Zealand in 1956.
However, they did not win again in the remainder of the decade and lost badly to strong Australian and English sides.
The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home.
They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961–62, and also won a home series against New Zealand .
They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia, and another series against England.
In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967–68.Panoramic View of the Eden Gardens Stadium during IPL 2008The key to India's bowling in the 1970s were the Indian spin quartet – Bishen Bedi , E.A.S. Prasanna , BS Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan .
This period also saw the emergence of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath .
Indian pitches have had tendency to support spin and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups.
These players were responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of Ajit Wadekar .
Gavaskar scored 774 runs in the West Indian series while Dilip Sardesai 's 112 played a big part in their one Test win.The advent of One Day International cricket in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world.
However, India was not considerably strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defence-based approaches to batting.
India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup.
Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975, India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.In contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and were particularly strong at home where their combination of stylish batsman and beguiling spinners were seen at their best.
India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976 when they chased 403 to win thanks to 112 from Viswanath.
This West Indian defeat is considered to be a watershed in the history of their cricket because it led to captain Clive Lloyd dispensing with spin altogether and relying entirely on a four-man pace attack.
In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without an individual scoring a century.
There were six fifties, the highest being 70 by Mohinder Amarnath .
The innings was the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures.During the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy Mohammed Azharuddin , Dilip Vengsarkar and all-rounder Ravi Shastri .
India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and two-time defending champions West Indies in the final, owing to a strong bowling performance.
In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory.
In 1984, India won the Asia Cup and in 1985, won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia.
Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the Indian subcontinent .
India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the subcontinent for the next 19 years.
The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev  at the pinnacle of their careers.
Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark.
Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets.
The period was also marked by an unstable leadership, with Gavaskar and Kapil exchanging the captaincy several times.With 619 wickets, Anil Kumble is the world's third highest wicket taker in Tests and India's highest Test and ODI wicket taker .
The addition of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team.
The following year, Javagal Srinath , India's fastest bowler since Amar Singh made his debut.
Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the subcontinent while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home.
After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the 1996 Cricket World Cup semifinal, the team underwent a year of change as Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid , later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's .
Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998.
With the captaincy burden removed, Tendulkar was the world's leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs, as India enjoyed a home Test series win over Australia, the best ranked team in the world.
After failing to reach the semifinals at the 1999 Cricket World Cup , Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3–0 on a tour of Australia and then 2–0 at home to South Africa.
Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again.
Ganguly was appointed the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman Ajay Jadeja were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively.
This period was described by the BBC as "the Indian cricket's worst hour".
However, the new core – Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly – swore not to let this happen to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times.
And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era.
Since 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements with the appointment of John Wright as India's first ever foreign coach .
India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001.
The series was famous for the Kolkata Test match, in which India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on.
Australian captain Steve Waugh labelled India as the "Final Frontier" as a result of his side's inability to win a Test series in India.
Victory in 2001 against the Australians marked the beginning of a dream run for India under their captain Ganguly, winning Test matches in Zimbabwe , Sri Lanka, West Indies and England.
The England series is also known for India's highest ODI run-chase of 325 runs at Lord's which came in the Natwest ODI Series final against England.
In the same year, India were joint-winners of the ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka, and then went to the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa where they reached the final only to be beaten by Australia .
The 2003–04 season also saw India play out a Test series in Australia where they drew 1–1 with the world champions, and then win a Test and ODI series in Pakistan.At the end of the 2004 season, India suffered from lack of form and fitness from its older players.
A defeat in a following home Test series against Australia was followed by an ODI home series defeat against Pakistan followed by a Test series levelled 1–1.
Greg Chappell took over from John Wright as the coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and his methods proved to be controversial during the beginning of his tenure.
The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly, resulting in Rahul Dravid being made captain.
This triggered a revival in the team's fortunes, following the emergence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina , and the coming of age of players like Irfan Pathan and Yuvraj Singh .
A thumping home series victory over Sri Lanka in 2005 and a drawn series with South Africa put India at second place in the ICC ODI rankings.
Dravid, Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were selected to play for the ICC World XI in the 2005 " SuperTest " against Australia.
A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second.
In December 2006, India played and won its first ever Twenty20 international in South Africa, becoming the most recent Test team to play Twenty20 cricket.
The beginning of 2007 had seen a revival in the Indian team's ODI fortunes before the 2007 Cricket World Cup .
Series victories against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, marked by the comeback of Ganguly, and strong form by Tendulkar, and the emergence of young players like Robin Uthappa saw many pundits to tip India as a real contender to win the 2007 Cricket World Cup .
However, defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw India fail to reach the second round.
After winning the Test series against England in August 2007, Dravid stepped down as the captain of the team following which Dhoni was made the captain of the Twenty20 and ODI team.
In September 2007, India won the first-ever Twenty20 World Cup held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by 5 runs in the final.
In 2007–08, they toured Australia where India lost the controversial Test series 2–1, but managed to win the CB series the following month with a whitewash final of Australia.
In April 2009, India secured their first Test series win in New Zealand in 41 years.
After beating Sri Lanka 2–0 in December 2009, India became the No. 1 Test team in the world.
They retained the ranking by drawing series against South Africa and Sri Lanka.
In October 2010, India whitewashed Australia 2–0 in the home Test series, giving them back-to-back series wins against them.
Later that year, India managed to draw the Test series in South Africa at 1–1.
On 2 April 2011, India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup by defeating Sri Lanka in the final, thus becoming the second team after West Indies and Australia to win the World Cup twice, the previous win being in 1983.
Gautam Gambhir and the skipper Dhoni led the way with 97 and 91* respectively.
India also became the first team to win the World Cup on home soil.India were whitewashed 4–0 in away Test series by England in August 2011 due to which England replaced India as the No. 1 Test team in the rankings.
This series was followed by another 4–0 whitewash of India in January 2012 in Australia.
The disastrous whitewashes saw the retirement of Dravid and VVS Laxman from Test cricket in 2012.
Tendulkar retired in November 2013 after his 200th Test match.
With Ganguly having retired in 2008, this period signalled the end of the fabled middle-order batting line-up Indian had for a decade.Main article: Board of Control for Cricket in IndiaThe Board of Control for Cricket in India  is the governing body for the Indian cricket team and first-class cricket in India.
The Board has been operating since 1929 and represents India at the International Cricket Council .
It is amongst the richest sporting organisations in the world.
It sold media rights for India's matches from 2006–2010 for US$612,000,000.
It manages the Indian team's sponsorships, its future tours and team selection.The International Cricket Council determines India's upcoming matches through its future tours program.
However, the BCCI, with its influential financial position in the cricketing world, has often challenged the ICC's program and called for more tours between India, Australia , Pakistan and England which are more likely to earn more revenue as opposed to tours with Bangladesh or Zimbabwe .
and the legitimacy of the ICC Champions Trophy .Selection for the Indian cricket team occurs through the BCCI's zonal selection policy, where each of the five zones is represented with one selector and one of the members nominated by BCCI as the Chairman of the Selection Committee.
This has sometimes led to controversy as to whether these selectors are biased towards their zones.
The current chairman of Selection Committee is Sandeep Patil .
Roger Binny , Vikram Rathore , Saba Karim and Rajinder Hans are the other members of the selection committee  whose terms started in September 2012 with BCCI holding the rights for a one-year extension.Since colours have made their way into international cricket, the Indian cricket team has chosen blue as their primary colour and have worn one or the other shade of blue.
The blue colour of their uniform has also earned them the nickname of "Men in Blue".
With the advent of the World Series Cup in the 1970s, each team was to don a primary and secondary colour on their uniforms.
The Indian team elected to wear light-blue as their primary colour and yellow as their secondary colour.
Even during the 1999 Cricket World Cup the secondary colour on the Indian cricket team's clothing has been yellow.
However, this has since been removed and replaced with the tricolour.
However, in the past the Indian ODI outfits were changed to different shades of blue, mostly darker than the current,Due to their love for blue color Nike with Board for Control of Cricket in India launched the mega campaign called "Bleed Blue" for the support of Indian team in 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup which turned out to be a huge success and people over the internet and places adopted this to cheer for India.
A new ultramarine blue coloured jersey of the one-day cricket team was released on 20 October 2010.

In the early years of his captaincy tenure, the team was whitewashed in the West Indies, England and Australia.
However, in 1967-68, Pataudi led India on its maiden New Zealand tour, which ended in India winning the Test series 3-1.
In 1970-71, Ajit Wadekar took over the captaincy from Pataudi.

See also: List of Indian Test cricketers and List of Indian ODI cricketersSachin Tendulkar, who began playing for India as a 16-year-old in 1989 and has since become the most prolific run-scorer in the history of both Test and ODI cricket, is easily the batsman with the most national achievements.
He holds the record of most appearances in both Tests and ODIs, most runs in both Tests and ODIs and most centuries in Tests and ODIs.
The highest score by an Indian is the 319 scored by Virender Sehwag in Chennai.
It is the second triple century in Test cricket by an Indian, the first being a 309 also made by Sehwag although against Pakistan.

In tours between these two nations, cricket visas are often employed to accommodate for the tens of thousands of fans wishing to cross the border to watch cricket.
This intense fan dedication is one of the major causes of the Indian Cricket Board's  financial success.
However, there are downsides to having such a cricket-loving population.
Many Indians hold cricket very close to their hearts and losses are not received well by the Indian population.
In some cases, particularly after losses to Pakistan or after a long string of weak performances, there have been reports of player effigies being burnt in the streets and vandalism of player homes.
Often, fans engage in protests regarding players if they believe that regionalism has affected selection, or because of regional partisan support for local players.
In 2005, when Sourav Ganguly was dropped due to lack of form, Ganguly's home state of West Bengal erupted in protests.
However, it should be noted that a successful string of results, victories against arch-rivals Pakistan or victory in major tournaments such as the World Cup are greeted with particular ecstasy from the Indian fans.

On his Test debut, Nehra started out well, dismissing Marvan Atapattu early but then failed to pick up any more wickets.
Similarly, he dismissed Alistair Campbell with only his 2nd ball in ODIs.
He was also part of the Indian team 's run at the 2003 World Cup in South Africa.
It was there against England , that he got his career-best ODI figures of six for 23.
His performance in the other matches in the World Cup were also noteworthy.However inconsistency and successive back and ankle injuries have prevented him from cementing his place in the Indian team .
His career statistics are better in ODI cricket than in Test cricket , but with 144 ODI wickets at an average of 30.54 his average is higher than all three of his main competitors for fast bowling places in the Indian team – Irfan Pathan , Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar , who all have bowling averages below 30.

Nehra redeemed himself by being the most economical bowler for his side taking 2 wickets in 10 overs for a mere 33 runs as India beat Pakistan by 29 runs.
He however could not play the final due to a fractured finger on his right hand.
After recovering from his injury, Nehra made himself available for the 2011 ODI series in England; after being ignored, he commented that he was 'deeply hurt'.

The Laws of Cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council  with additional Standard Playing Conditions for Test matches and One Day Internationals.
Cricket is generally believed to have been first played in southern England in the 16th century.
By the end of the 18th century, it had become the national sport of England.
The expansion of the British Empire led to cricket being played overseas and by the mid-19th century the first international match was held.
ICC, the game's governing body, has 10 full members .
The game is most popular in Australasia , England , the Indian subcontinent , the West Indies and Southern Africa .A number of words have been suggested as sources for the term "cricket".
In the earliest definite reference to the sport in 1598 it is called creckett.
One possible source for the name is the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff.
Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy , the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel, meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.
According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University , "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey , met de .
Main article: History of cricketEarly cricket was at some time or another described as "a club striking a ball  the ancient games of club-ball, stool-ball, trap-ball, stob-ball".
Cricket can definitely be traced back to Tudor times in early 16th-century England.Written evidence exists of a game known as creag being played by Prince Edward , the son of Edward I  , at Newenden, Kent in 1301  and there has been speculation, but no evidence, that this was a form of cricket.The earliest written evidence of the game of cricket may date back to France , in a letter written to King Louis XI in 1478, by a man named Estiavannet.
He described a game being played by the villagers of Liettres .
It is believed that it was originally a children's game but references around 1610 During the 17th century, numerous references indicate the growth of cricket in the south-east of England.
By the end of the century, it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is believed that the first professionals appeared in the years following the Restoration in 1660.
A newspaper report survives of "a great cricket match" with eleven players a side that was played for high stakes in Sussex in 1697, and this is the earliest known reference to a cricket match of such importance.The game underwent major development in the 18th century and became the national sport of England.
Betting played a major part in that development with rich patrons forming their own "select XIs".
Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury.
The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match.In the 1730s Frederick Prince of Wales played a major role in developing the sport.
Bowling evolved around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman.
This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old "hockey stick" shape.The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next 20 years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point.
MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket .
New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket .
The 19th century saw underarm bowling replaced by first roundarm and then overarm bowling .
Both developments were controversial.Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex CCC in 1839, which ultimately formed the official County Championship in 1890.
Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in India, North America, the Caribbean, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
In 1844, the first international cricket match took place between the United States and Canada .In 1859, a team of England players went on the first overseas tour .
The first Australian team to tour overseas was a team of Aboriginal stockmen who travelled to England in 1868 to play matches against county teams.
.Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England.
The last two decades before the First World War have been called the " Golden Age of cricket ".
It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed.Don Bradman of Australia had a Test average of 99.94 and an overall first-class average of 95.14, records unmatched by any other player.
The inter-war years were dominated by one player: Australia's Don Bradman , statistically the greatest batsman of all time.
It was the determination of the England team to overcome his skill that brought about the infamous Bodyline series in 1932–33, particularly from the accurate short-pitched bowling of Harold Larwood .Test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of the West Indies , India , and New Zealand before the Second World War and then Pakistan , Sri Lanka , and Bangladesh in the post-war period.
However, South Africa was banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 because of its government's apartheid policy.Cricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant.
As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased.
The first Limited Overs International was played in 1971.
The governing International Cricket Council  saw its potential and staged the first limited overs Cricket World Cup in 1975.
In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, Twenty20 , has made an immediate impact.Main article: Laws of cricketCricket is a bat and ball game, played between two teams of eleven players each.
One team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen.
The objective of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent.
In some forms of cricket, it may also be necessary to dismiss the opposition in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn .A cricket match is divided into periods called innings  are on the field at any given time.
The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.A coin toss is held by the team captains  just before the match starts: the winner decides whether to bat or field first.The cricket field is usually oval in shape, with a rectangular pitch at the center.
The edge of the playing field is marked with a boundary, which could be a fence, part of the stands, a rope or a painted line.At each end of the pitch is a wooden target called a wicket, placed 22 yards apart.
The pitch is marked with painted lines: a bowling crease in line with the wicket, and a batting or popping crease four feet in front of it.
The wicket is made of three vertical stumps supporting two small horizontal bails.
A wicket is put down if at least one bail is dislodged, or one stump is knocked down .
This is also described as breaking, knocking down, or hitting the wicket – though if the ball hits the wicket but does not dislodge a bail or stump then it is not down.At any instant each batsman owns a particular wicket  and, except when actually batting, is safe when he is in his ground.
This means that at least one part of his body or bat is touching the ground behind the popping crease.
If his wicket is put down while the ball is live and he is out of his ground then he is dismissed, but the other batsman is safe.
A ball being bowled.
From back to front -- umpire The two batsmen take positions at opposite ends of the pitch.
One designated member of the fielding team, called the bowler, bowls the ball from one end of the pitch to the striking batsman at the other end.
The batsman at the bowling end is called the non-striker, and stands to the side of his wicket, behind his crease.
The batsman are allowed to step forward of their creases, though at some risk.
Another member of the fielding team, the wicket keeper, is positioned behind the striker's wicket.The fielding team's other nine members stand outside the pitch, spread out across the field.
The fielding captain often strategically changes their position between balls.There is always an umpire at each end of the pitch.The bowler usually retreats a few yards .The batsman tries to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket by striking the ball with his bat.
If the bowler succeeds in putting down the wicket the batsman is dismissed and is said to be bowled out.
If the batsman misses the ball, but any part of his body prevents it from reaching the wicket, then he is out leg before wicket, or "LBW".If the batsman hits the ball but it is caught by a fielder without bouncing then he is caught out.
If it is caught by the bowler then he is caught and bowled; by the wicket keeper, caught behind.If the batsman is successful in striking the ball and it is not caught without bouncing, then the two batsmen may try to score points  before the batsman who owns that wicket reaches his ground behind the crease.
The dismissed batsman is run out.
Batsmen will sometimes start to run, change their mind, and return to their original positions.If the batsman hits the ball over the field boundary without the ball touching the field, the batting team scores six runs.
If the ball touches the ground and then reaches the boundary, the batting team scores four runs.
The batsmen might start running before the ball reaches the boundary, but those runs don't count.If the batsman misses the ball they can still attempt extra runs : these are called byes.
If the ball bounces off his body then it is called a leg bye.If the striking batsman leaves his ground and misses the ball, then the wicket keeper can catch it and put down the wicket -- stumped.In case of a no ball or a wide the batsman can choose to strike the ball, earning runs in addition to the fixed penalty.
If he does so he can only be dismissed by being run out.When the batsmen have finished attempting their runs the ball is dead, and is returned to the bowler to be bowled again.
The ball becomes live when he starts his run up.
The bowler continues to bowl toward the same wicket, regardless of any switch of the batsmen's positions.
A batsman may retire from an innings without being dismissed, usually after reaching a milestone like a hundred runs .A dismissed batsman leaves the field, to be replaced by another batsman from the batting team.
However, even though the wicket may have been put down, or the ball caught, the batsman is not actually dismissed until the fielding team appeal to the umpires for a decision, traditionally using the expression "How's that" , which includes TV replays and other electronic equipment such as hawk eye, hotspot and the snickometer.After a bowler has bowled six times , another member of the fielding team is designated as the new bowler, the old bowler taking up a fielding position.
The batsmen stay in place, and the new bowler bowls to the opposite wicket, so the role of striker and non-striker reverse.
The wicket keeper and the two umpires always change positions, as do many of the fielders, and play continues.
Fielding team members may bowl multiple times during an innings, but may not bowl two overs in succession.The innings is complete when 10 of the 11 members of the batting team have been dismissed , when a set number of overs has been played, or when the batting team declares that they have enough runs.The number of innings and the number of overs per innings vary depending on the format of the match.
In a match which is not a limited overs format the umpires will usually specify that the last session of the last innings will have a specified number of overs.The match always ends when all innings have been completed.
The umpires can also call an end to the match in case of bad light or weather.
But in many cases the match ends immediately when the first team to bat has played all of its innings, and the last team to bat has more runs.
In four-innings games the last team may not even need to play its second innings: this team is said to win by an innings.
If this winning team has not completed its last innings, and still has, for example, five batsmen who are not out or have not even batted, then they are said to "win by five wickets".
If the last team to bat is losing, is all out, and has 10 fewer runs than the other team, then the winning team "wins by 10 runs".
If the two teams both play all their innings and they have the same number of runs, then it is a tie.In four-innings matches there is also the possibility of a draw: the team with fewer runs still has batsmen on the field when the game ends.
This has a major effect on strategy: a team will often declare an innings when they have accumulated enough runs, in the hope that they will have enough time left to dismiss the other team and thus avoid a draw, but risking a loss if the other team scores enough runs.Cricket is played on a grassy field .
The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet  side and are defended by the batting side, which seeks to accumulate runs.A wicket consists of three stumps that are hammered into the ground, and topped with two bails .Each wicket on the pitch consists of three wooden stumps placed vertically, in line with one another.
They are surmounted by two wooden crosspieces called bails ; the total height of the wicket including bails is 28.5 inches .Four lines, known as creases , are painted onto the pitch around the wicket areas to define the batsman's "safe territory" and to determine the limit of the bowler's approach.
These are called the "popping"  crease, the bowling crease and two "return" creases.The stumps are placed in line on the bowling creases and so these creases must be 22 yards .When bowling the ball, the bowler's back foot in his "delivery stride" must land within the two return creases while at least some part of his front foot must land on or behind the popping crease.
If the bowler breaks this rule, the umpire calls " No ball ".The importance of the popping crease to the batsman is that it marks the limit of his safe territory.
He can be dismissed stumped or run out  if the wicket is broken while he is "out of his ground".Two different types of cricket balls :i) A used white ball.
White balls are mainly utilised in limited overs cricket , especially in matches played at night, under floodlights .ii)
A used red ball, Red balls are utilised in Test cricket and first-class cricket and some other forms of cricket .The essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers the ball from his end of the pitch towards the batsman who, armed with a bat is "on strike" at the other end.The bat is made of wood .The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid , with a circumference of 9 inches .
Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads.
The ball has a "seam": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior.
The seam on a new ball is prominent, and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner.
During cricket matches, the quality of the ball changes to a point where it is no longer usable, and during this decline its properties alter and thus influence the match.The game on the field is regulated by two umpires , one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called "square leg", a position 15–20 metres to the side of the "on strike" batsman.
The main role of the umpires is to adjudicate on whether a ball is correctly bowled .
Umpires also determine when intervals start and end, decide on the suitability of the playing conditions and can interrupt or even abandon the match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.Off the field and in televised matches, there is often a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence.
The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test matches and limited overs internationals played between two ICC full members.
These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws of cricket and the spirit of the game.The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers , one representing each team.
The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire.
For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out ; he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs.
The scorers are required by the Laws of cricket to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.The innings  is the term used for the collective performance of the batting side.
In theory, all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they all do so.
Depending on the type of match being played, each team has one or two innings apiece.The main aim of the bowler, supported by his fielders, is to dismiss the batsman.
A batsman when dismissed is said to be "out" and that means he must leave the field of play and be replaced by the next batsman on his team.
When ten batsmen have been dismissed , then the whole team is dismissed and the innings is over.
The last batsman, the one who has not been dismissed, is not allowed to continue alone as there must always be two batsmen "in".
This batsman is termed "not out".An innings can end early for three reasons: because the batting side's captain has chosen to "declare" the innings closed , or because the batting side has achieved its target and won the game, or because the game has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time.
In each of these cases the team's innings ends with two "not out" batsmen, unless the innings is declared closed at the fall of a wicket and the next batsman has not joined in the play.In limited overs cricket, there might be two batsmen still "not out" when the last of the allotted overs has been bowled.The bowler bowls the ball in sets of six deliveries  and each set of six balls is called an over .
This name came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls have been bowled.
At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not.
A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can bowl unchanged at the same end for several overs.
The batsmen do not change ends and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa.
The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at square leg now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa.A team consists of eleven players.
Depending on his or her primary skills, a player may be classified as a specialist batsman or bowler .
A well-balanced team usually has five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers.
Teams nearly always include a specialist wicket-keeper because of the importance of this fielding position.
Each team is headed by a captain who is responsible for making tactical decisions such as determining the batting order, the placement of fielders and the rotation of bowlers.A player who excels in both batting and bowling is known as an all-rounder .
One who excels as a batsman and wicket-keeper is known as a "wicket-keeper/batsman", sometimes regarded as a type of all-rounder.
True all-rounders are rare as most players focus on either batting or bowling skills.Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan holds the world record for delivering the fastest ball .
The bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a "run-up", although some bowlers with a very slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling.
A fast bowler needs momentum and takes quite a long run-up, running very fast as he does so.The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 90 miles per hour  and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly.
Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile.
Some fast bowlers make use of the seam of the ball so that it "curves" or "swings" in flight.
This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into mistiming his shot so that the ball touches the edge of the bat and can then be "caught behind" by the wicketkeeper or a slip fielder.At the other end of the bowling scale is the "spinner" who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman.
A spinner will often "buy his wicket" by "tossing one up"  to lure the batsman into making a poor shot.
The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often "flighted" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be "trapped" into getting himself out.In between the pacemen and the spinners are the "medium pacers" who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration.All bowlers are classified according to their looks or style.
The classifications , as with much cricket terminology, can be very confusing.
Hence, a bowler could be classified as LF, meaning he is a left arm fast bowler; or as LBG, meaning he is a right arm spin bowler who bowls deliveries that are called a " leg break " and a " Googly ".During the bowling action the elbow may be held at any angle and may bend further, but may not straighten out.
If the elbow straightens illegally then the square-leg umpire may call no-ball : this is known as "throwing" or "chucking", and can be difficult to detect.
The current laws allow a bowler to straighten his arm 15 degrees or less.Fielding positions in cricket for a right-handed batsmanAll eleven players on the fielding side take the field together.
One of them is the wicket-keeper aka "keeper" who operates behind the wicket being defended by the batsman on strike.
Wicket-keeping is normally a specialist occupation and his primary job is to gather deliveries that the batsman does not hit, so that the batsmen cannot run byes.
He wears special gloves , a box over the groin, and pads to cover his lower legs.
Owing to his position directly behind the striker, the wicket-keeper has a good chance of getting a batsman out caught off a fine edge from the bat.
He is the only player who can get a batsman out stumped .Apart from the one currently bowling, the other nine fielders are tactically deployed by the team captain in chosen positions around the field.
These positions are not fixed but they are known by specific and sometimes colourful names such as "slip", "third man", "silly mid on" and "long leg".
There are always many unprotected areas.The captain is the most important member of the fielding side as he determines all the tactics including who should bowl ; and he is responsible for "setting the field", though usually in consultation with the bowler.In all forms of cricket, if a fielder gets injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him.
The substitute cannot bowl, act as a captain or keep wicket.
The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return.English cricketer W.G. Grace "taking guard" in 1883.
His pads and bat are very similar to those used today.
The gloves have evolved somewhat.
Many modern players utilise more defensive equipment than was available to Grace, notably helmets and arm guards.At any one time, there are two batsmen in the playing area.
One takes station at the striker's end to defend the wicket as above and to score runs if possible.
His partner, the non-striker, is at the end where the bowler is operating.Batsmen come in to bat in a batting order , decided by the team captain.
The first two batsmen – the "openers" – usually face the hostile bowling from fresh fast bowlers with a new ball.
The top batting positions are usually given to the most competent batsmen in the team, and the team's bowlers – who are typically, but not always, less skilled as batsmen – typically bat last.
The pre-announced batting order is not mandatory; when a wicket falls any player who has not yet batted may be sent in next.If a batsman "retires"  and cannot return, he is actually "not out" and his retirement does not count as a dismissal, though in effect he has been dismissed because his innings is over.
Substitute batsmen are not allowed.A skilled batsman can use a wide array of "shots" or "strokes" in both defensive and attacking mode.
The idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade.
If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an " edge ".
Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply "blocking" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run.An iconic image of Australia's Victor Trumper stepping out to driveThere is a wide variety of shots played in cricket.
The batsman's repertoire includes strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., " cut ", "drive", "hook", "pull".A batsman is not required to play a shot; in the event that he believes the ball will not hit his wicket and there is no opportunity to score runs, he can "leave" the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper.
Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat.
He can deliberately use his leg to block the ball and thereby "pad it away" but this is risky because of the leg before wicket rule.In the event of an injured batsman being fit to bat but not to run, the umpires and the fielding captain were previously able to allow another member of the batting side to be a runner .
The runner's only task was to run between the wickets instead of the incapacitated batsman, and he was required to wear and carry exactly the same equipment as the batsman.
As of 2011 the ICC outlawed the use of runners as they felt this was being abused.
The directions in which a right-handed batsman intends to send the ball when playing various cricketing shots.
The diagram for a left-handed batsman is a mirror image of this one.The primary concern of the batsman on strike .
Each completed run increments the score.More than one run can be scored from a single hit; but, while hits worth one to three runs are common, the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.
To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary.
The batsmen do not need to run if the ball reaches or crosses the boundary.Brian Lara of the West Indies holds the record for highest score in both Tests and first-class cricket.Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of "overthrows" by a fielder returning the ball.
If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker.
Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: "yes", "no" and "wait" are often heard.Running is a calculated risk because if a fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman is out of his ground , the batsman is run out .A team's score is reported in terms of the number of runs scored and the number of batsmen that have been dismissed.
For example, if five batsmen are out and the team has scored 224 runs, they are said to have scored 224 for the loss of 5 wickets .Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras  due to errors made by the fielding side.
This is achieved in four ways:No ball: a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules of bowling either by  the free hit rule has been introduced.
The ball following a front foot no-ball will be a free-hit for the batsman, whereby he is safe from losing his wicket except for being run-out.Wide: a penalty of one extra that is conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach; as with a no ball, a wide must be re-bowled.
If a wide ball crosses the boundary, five runs are awarded to the batting side .Leg bye: extra awarded if the ball hits the batsman's body, but not his bat, while attempting a legitimate shot, and it goes away from the fielders to give the batsmen time to run in the conventional way.When the bowler has bowled a no ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball  to claim byes and leg byes but these only count towards the team total, not to the striker's individual total for which runs must be scored off the bat.There are eleven ways in which a batsman can be dismissed; five relatively common and six extremely rare.
The common forms of dismissal are "bowled", "caught", "leg before wicket" , "run out", and "stumped".
Less common methods are "hit wicket", "hit the ball twice", "obstructed the field", "handled the ball" and "timed out" – these are almost unknown in the professional game.
The eleventh - retired out - is not treated as an on-field dismissal but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.If the dismissal is obvious  "how's that?" – normally reduced to howzat?
If the umpire agrees with the appeal, he will raise a forefinger and say "Out!".
Otherwise he will shake his head and say "Not out".
Appeals are particularly loud when the circumstances of the claimed dismissal are unclear, as is always the case with lbw and often with run outs and stumpings.Bowled : the bowler has hit the wicket with the delivery and the wicket has "broken" with at least one bail being dislodged .
Caught : the batsman has hit the ball with his bat, or with his hand which was holding the bat, and the ball has been caught before it has touched the ground by a member of the fielding side.
Leg before wicket  when it would have gone on to hit the stumps.
This rule exists mainly to prevent the batsman from guarding his wicket with his legs instead of the bat.
To be given out lbw, the ball must not bounce outside leg stump or strike the batsmen outside the line of leg-stump.
It may bounce outside off-stump.
The batsman may only be dismissed lbw by a ball striking him outside the line of off-stump if he has not made a genuine attempt to play the ball with his bat.
Run out : a member of the fielding side has broken or "put down" the wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman was out of his ground; this usually occurs by means of an accurate throw to the wicket while the batsmen are attempting a run, although a batsman can be given out Run out even when he is not attempting a run; he merely needs to be out of his ground.
Stumped is similar except that it is done by the wicketkeeper after the batsman has missed the bowled ball and has stepped out of his ground, and is not attempting a run.
Hit wicket : a batsman is out hit wicket if he dislodges one or both bails with his bat, person, clothing or equipment in the act of receiving a ball, or in setting off for a run having just received a ball.
Hit the ball twice is very unusual and was introduced as a safety measure to counter dangerous play and protect the fielders.
The batsman may legally play the ball a second time only to stop the ball hitting the wicket after he has already played it.
"Hit" does not necessarily refer to the batsman's bat.
Obstructing the field : another unusual dismissal which tends to involve a batsman deliberately getting in the way  of a fielder.
Handled the ball : a batsman must not deliberately touch the ball with his hand, for example to protect his wicket.
Note that the batsman's hand or glove counts as part of the bat while the hand is holding the bat, so batsmen are frequently caught off their gloves .
Timed out usually means that the next batsman was not ready to receive a delivery within three minutes of the previous one being dismissed.
In the vast majority of cases, it is the striker who is out when a dismissal occurs.
If the non-striker is dismissed it is usually by being run out, but he could also be dismissed for obstructing the field, handling the ball or being timed out.A batsman may leave the field without being dismissed.
If injured or taken ill the batsman may temporarily retire, and be replaced by the next batsman.
This is recorded as retired hurt or retired ill .
The retiring batsman is not out, and may resume the innings later.
An unimpaired batsman may retire, and this is treated as being dismissed retired out ; no player is credited with the dismissal.
Batsmen cannot be out bowled, caught, leg before wicket, stumped or hit wicket off a no ball.
They cannot be out bowled, caught, leg before wicket, or hit the ball twice off a wide.
Some of these modes of dismissal can occur without the bowler bowling a delivery.
The batsman who is not on strike may be run out by the bowler if he leaves his crease before the bowler bowls, and a batsman can be out obstructing the field or retired out at any time.
Timed out is, by its nature, a dismissal without a delivery.
With all other modes of dismissal, only one batsman can be dismissed per ball bowled.Ten of the eleven batsmen are out ; in this case, the team is said to be "all out"The team has only one batsman left who can bat, one or more of the remaining players being unavailable owing to injury, illness or absence; again, the team is said to be "all out"The predetermined number of overs has been bowled A captain declares his team's innings closed while at least two of his batsmen are not out If the team that bats last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, the team is said to have "lost by n runs" .
If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have "won by n wickets", where n is the number of wickets left to fall.
For instance a team that passes its opponents' score having only lost six wickets would have won "by four wickets".In a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total.
The team with the greater score is then said to have won by an innings and n runs, and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores.If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie ; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side.
In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw .If the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of deliveries for each innings is often imposed.
Such a match is called a "limited overs" or "one-day" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur.
If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth-Lewis method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score.
A one-day match can also be declared a "no-result" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.For a team sport, cricket places individual players under unusual scrutiny and pressure.
Bowler, batsman, and fielder all act essentially independently of each other.
While team managements can signal bowler or batsman to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts.
Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is slightly mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for a long time.Cricket is a unique game where in addition to the laws, the players must abide by the "Spirit of the Game".
Even in the modern game fielders are known to signal to the umpire that a boundary was hit, despite what could have been considered a spectacular save .
In addition to this, some batsmen have been known to "walk" when they think they are out even if the umpire does not declare them out.
This is a high level of sportsmanship, as a batsman can easily take advantage of incorrect umpiring decisions.Floodlights at M. A. Chidambaram Stadium , ChennaiCricket is a sport played predominantly in the drier periods of the year.
But, even so, the weather is a major factor in all cricket matches.A scheduled game of cricket cannot be played in wet weather.
Dampness affects the bounce of the ball on the wicket and is a risk to all players involved in the game.
Many grounds have facilities to cover the cricket pitch  to even hover covers which form an airtight seal around the wicket.
However, most grounds do not have the facilities to cover the outfield.
This means that in the event of heavy bouts of bad weather, games may be cancelled, abandoned or suspended due to an unsafe outfield.Another factor in cricket is the amount of light available.
At grounds without floodlights .On the other hand, in instances of good light, batsmen can utilise sight-screens which enable batsmen to have a white background against which they can pick out the red ball  with greater ease.Unlike those of most sports, cricket playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape.
While the dimensions of the pitch and infield are specifically regulated, the Laws of Cricket do not specify the size or shape of the field.
The field boundaries are sometimes painted and sometimes marked by a rope.
Pitch and outfield variations can have a significant effect on how balls behave and are fielded as well as on batting.
Pitches vary in consistency, and thus in the amount of bounce, spin, and seam movement available to the bowler.
Hard pitches are usually good to bat on because of high but even bounce.
Dry pitches tend to deteriorate for batting as cracks often appear, and when this happens to the pitch, spinners can play a major role.
Damp pitches, or pitches covered in grass , allow good fast bowlers to extract extra bounce.
Such pitches tend to offer help to fast bowlers throughout the match, but become better for batting as the game goes on.
While players of other outdoor sports deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardised.
Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play.
These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ground.
A given ground may acquire a reputation as batsman friendly or bowler friendly if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements.
The absence of a standardised field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team makeup and players' statistical records.Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats, varying playing standard and level of formality and the desired time that the match should last.
A pertinent division in terms of professional cricket is between matches limited by time in which the teams have two innings apiece, and those limited by number of overs, in which they have a single innings each.
The former, known as first-class cricket , has a duration of three to five days .Typically, two-innings matches have at least six hours of playing time each day.
Limited overs matches often last six hours or more.
There are usually formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea with brief informal breaks for drinks.
There is also a short interval between innings.Amateur cricketers rarely play matches that last longer than a single day; these may loosely be divided into declaration matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares ; and limited overs matches, in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team's innings individually.
These will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at the weekend and the ever popular 20 over format during the evenings.
Other forms of cricket, such as indoor cricket and garden cricket remain popular.Historically, a form of cricket known as single wicket had been extremely successful and many of these contests in the 18th and 19th centuries qualify as major cricket matches.
In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts.
Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began.A Test match between South Africa and England in January 2005.
The men wearing black trousers are the umpires .
Teams in Test cricket, first-class cricket and club cricket wear traditional white uniforms and use red cricket balls .Test cricket is the highest standard of first-class cricket.
A Test match is an international fixture between teams representing those countries that are Full Members of the ICC.Although the term "Test match" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 1876–77 Australian season .
Subsequently, eight other national teams have achieved Test status: South Africa .
Zimbabwe suspended its Test status in 2006 due to its inability to compete against other Test teams, Welsh players are eligible to play for England , which is in effect an England and Wales team.
The West Indies team comprises players from numerous states in the Caribbean , notably Barbados , Guyana , Jamaica , Trinidad & Tobago , the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands .Test matches between two teams are usually played in a group of matches called a " series ".
Matches last up to five days and a series normally consists of three to five matches.
Test matches that are not finished within the allotted time are drawn.
In the case of Test and first-class cricket : the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss.
Since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes .
Some other bilateral series have individual trophies too: for example, the Wisden Trophy is contested by England and West Indies; the Frank Worrell Trophy by Australia and West Indies and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy between India and Australia.See also: One Day International and Twenty20 InternationalSir Viv Richards of the West Indies was voted by Wisden as the greatest One Day International batsman of all time.Standard limited overs cricket was introduced in England in the 1963 season in the form of a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs.
In 1969, a national league competition was established.
The concept was gradually introduced to the other major cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971.
In 1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England.
Limited overs cricket has seen various innovations including the use of multi-coloured kit and floodlit matches using a white ball.
A "one day match", named so because each match is scheduled for completion in a single day, is the common form of limited overs cricket played on an international level.
In practice, matches sometimes continue on a second day if they have been interrupted or postponed by bad weather.
The main objective of a limited overs match is to produce a definite result and so a conventional draw is not possible, but matches can be undecided if the scores are tied or if bad weather prevents a result.
Each team plays one innings only and faces a limited number of overs, usually a maximum of 50.
The Cricket World Cup is held in one day format and the last World Cup in 2011 was won by the co-hosts, India.
The next World Cup will hosted by Australia and New Zealand in 2015.Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session.
The original idea, when the concept was introduced in England in 2003, was to provide workers with an evening entertainment.
It was commercially successful and has been adopted internationally.
The inaugural Twenty20 World Championship was held in 2007 and won by India, three subsequent events have been held which were won by Pakistan, England and West Indies respectively.
The next tournament is scheduled to be held in 2014 .
After the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 many domestic Twenty20 leagues were born.
First of them was Indian Cricket League which was a rebel league since it was not authorized by BCCI .
BCCI then formed its official league called the Indian Premier League .
The official league went on to become a successful annual affair that attracted players and audience around the globe, while the Indian Cricket League has been disbanded.
After the success of Indian premier league many other domestic leagues were formed in all major cricketing nations.
Recently Twenty20 Champions League was formed as a tournament for domestic clubs of various countries.In this league competition played between the top domestic teams from major cricketing nations.Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1895.
The team first became County Championship champions in 1893.First-class cricket includes Test cricket but the term is generally used to refer to the highest level of domestic cricket in those countries with full ICC membership, although there are exceptions to this.
First-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the County Championship .
The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890.
The most successful club has been Yorkshire County Cricket Club with 30 official titles.Australia established its national first-class championship in 1892–93 when the Sheffield Shield was introduced.
In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states.
New South Wales has won the maximum number of titles with 45 to 2008.National championship trophies to be established elsewhere included the Ranji Trophy .
Some of these competitions have been updated and renamed in recent years.Domestic limited overs competitions began with England's Gillette Cup knockout in 1963.
Countries usually stage seasonal limited overs competitions in both knockout and league format.
In recent years, national Twenty20 competitions have been introduced, usually in knockout form though some incorporate mini-leagues.Club cricket is a mainly amateur, but still formal, form of the sport of cricket, usually involving teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening.
There is a great deal of variation in game format although the Laws of Cricket are always observed.Club cricket is frequently organised in a league or cup format.
Games are limited by either time or overs.
Limited overs games usually last between 20 and 60 overs per innings.
A less common, but more traditional, format is limiting the game by time only.
Games can range from a few hours in the evening to two days long.
A modern innovation is the introduction of Twenty20 competitions, both as a format in the existing leagues and new leagues solely based on Twenty20, such as LastManStanding.Standards of play can vary from semi-professional to occasional recreational level and club cricket is often enjoyed as much for the social element as for the competition.
Most clubs have their own ground to play on regularly, often including a field and pavilion or club house.
An exception being 'Wandering Sides' who use other's grounds.Many leagues have been formed around the world of varying degrees of professionalism, the oldest being the Birmingham & District Premier League in the Birmingham area of England, founded in 1888.A game of French cricket in progress in Jervis Bay , AustraliaThere are numerous variations of the sport played throughout the world that include indoor cricket , French cricket , beach cricket , Kwik cricket and all sorts of card games and board games that have been inspired by cricket.
In these variants, the rules are often changed to make the game playable with limited resources or to render it more convenient and enjoyable for the participants.Indoor Cricket was first invented in 1970.
It is similar to outdoor cricket except that is played in an indoor sports hall with 6 players per team.
It is extremely popular in the UK with national championships and multiple independent leagues.
Another less formal version of indoor cricket is played in a smaller arena with a soft ball and without pads was invented some years later and is commonly played in the Southern Hemisphere, and even has its own nominal international championships, including World Cups .In the UK, garden cricket is a popular version of the sport, played in gardens and on recreation grounds around the country by adults and children alike.
Although a cricket bat and ball are generally used, other equipment such as pads and gloves are not.
The exact rules will vary based on the number of participants and the available space.Families and teenagers play backyard cricket or tennis ball cricket in suburban yards or driveways, and the cities of India and Pakistan play host to countless games of " Gully Cricket " or " tape ball " in their long narrow streets.
Sometimes the rules are improvised: e.g. it may be agreed that fielders can catch the ball with one hand after one bounce and claim a wicket; or if only a few people are available then everyone may field while the players take it in turns to bat and bowl.
Tennis balls and homemade bats are often used, and a variety of objects may serve as wickets: for example, the batter's legs as in French cricket , which did not in fact originate in France, and is usually played by small children.In Kwik cricket , the bowler does not have to wait for the batsman to be ready before a delivery, leading to a faster, more exhausting game designed to appeal to children, which is often used in physical education lessons at UK schools.
Another modification to increase the pace of the game is the "Tip and Run", "Tipity" Run, "Tipsy Run" or "Tippy-Go" rule, in which the batter must run when the ball touches the bat, even if it the contact is unintentional or minor.
This rule, seen only in impromptu games, speeds the match up by removing the batsman's right to block the ball.In Samoa a form of cricket called Kilikiti is played in which hockey stick -shaped bats are used.
In original English cricket, the hockey stick shape was replaced by the modern straight bat in the 1760s after bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it.
In Estonia , teams gather over the winter for the annual Ice Cricket tournament.
The game juxtaposes the normal summer pursuit with harsh, wintry conditions.
Rules are otherwise similar to those for the six-a-side game.Main articles: International structure of cricket , International Cricket Council and World Cricket LeagueICC member nations.
The  Test playing nations are shown in orange; the associate member nations are shown in yellow; the affiliate member nations are shown in purple.The International Cricket Council , which has its headquarters in Dubai , is the international governing body of cricket.
It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989.The ICC has 104 members : 10 Full Members that play official Test matches, 34 Associate Members, and 60 Affiliate Members.
The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the Cricket World Cup.
It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals.
Each nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country.
The cricket board also selects the national squad and organises home and away tours for the national team.
In the West Indies these matters are addressed by the West Indies Cricket Board which consists of members appointed by four national boards and two multi-national boards.Full Members are the governing bodies for cricket in a country or associated countries.
Full Members may also represent a geographical area.
All Full Members have a right to send one representative team to play official Test matches.
Also, all Full Member nations are automatically qualified to play ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals .
West Indies cricket team does not represent one country instead an amalgamation of over 20 countries from the Caribbean .
The English Cricket team represents both England and Wales.All the associate and affiliate members are not qualified to play Test Cricket , however ICC grants One Day International status to its associate and affiliate members based on their success in the World Cricket League .
The top six teams will be awarded One day international and Twenty20 International status, which will allow the associate and affiliate teams to be eligible to play the full members and play official ODI cricket.Organized cricket lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports.
Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes.
At the professional level, statistics for Test cricket, one-day internationals, and first-class cricket are recorded separately.
However, since Test matches are a form of first-class cricket, a player's first-class statistics will include his Test match statistics – but not vice versa.
The Guide to Cricketers was a cricket annual edited by Fred Lillywhite between 1849 and his death in 1866.
Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was founded in 1864 by the English cricketer John Wisden  as a competitor to The Guide to Cricketers.
Its annual publication has continued uninterrupted to the present day, making it the longest running sports annual in history.Innings : The number of innings in which the batsman actually batted.Not outs : The number of times the batsman was not out at the conclusion of an innings they batted in.Centuries : The number of innings in which the batsman scored one hundred runs or more.Run rate  scores in an over of six balls.Overs : The number of overs bowled.Balls : The number of balls bowled.
Overs is more traditional, but balls is a more useful statistic because the number of balls per over has varied historically.Wides : The number of wides bowled.A match's statistics are summarised on a scorecard.
Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks .
The earliest known scorecards were printed in 1776 by Pratt, scorer to the Sevenoaks Vine Cricket Club, but it was many years before his invention was widely adopted.
The introduction of scoreboards revolutionised cricket by allowing spectators to keep track of the day's play.
In 1848, Fred Lillywhite used a portable printing press at grounds to print updated scorecards.
In 1858, the Kennington Oval introduced the first mobile scorebox, "a house on rollers with figures for telegraphing on each side".
In 1881, the Melbourne Cricket Ground erected the first cricket scoreboard.
The scoreboard, located at the western end of the ground, gave the batsman's name and method of dismissal.
Cricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere.
Cricket has had an influence on the lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with such phrases as "that's not cricket" , "had a good innings ", " sticky wicket ", and "bowled over".
There have been many cricket films .
The term "Bradmanesque" from Don Bradman's name has become a generic term for outstanding excellence, both within cricket and in the wider world.

The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket.
The shortened format was initially introduced to bolster crowds for the domestic game, and was not intended to be played internationally, but the first Twenty20 International took place on 17 February 2005 when Australia defeated New Zealand , and the first tournament was played two years later, with the introduction of the ICC World Twenty20 .
There remain limits on how many Twenty20 Internationals a team can play each year, in order to protect Test cricket and One Day Internationals .
As of 2015, there are eighteen nations with Twenty20 International status.The shorter format of the game makes reaching the traditional milestones of scoring a century or taking five wickets in an innings more difficult, and few players have achieved these.
The highest individual score in a Twenty20 International is 156, made by Australia's Aaron Finch against England in 2013, while Sri Lanka's Ajantha Mendis is the only bowler to have taken six wickets in an innings, and fewer than twenty players have taken five wickets in an innings.Cricket itself was probably first played in England in the Late Middle Ages , but it did not rise to prominence until the eighteenth century.
A set of laws were drawn up in 1744, and the game achieved a level of relative standardisation by the late nineteenth century.
In the 1990s, a number of countries were exploring the possibility of a shorter game still: in New Zealand, Martin Crowe developed Cricket Max , in which each team bats for 10 eight-ball overs, The first Twenty20 International match between two men's sides was played on 17 February 2005, involving Australia and New Zealand .
Wisden Cricketers' Almanack reported that "neither side took the game especially seriously", The game had initially been developed to boost the interest in domestic cricket, and to aid this the international teams were only allowed to host three T20Is each year.
The cricket manager for the ICC, David Richardson, also commented that "Part of the success of Twenty20 cricket is making sure it can coexist with Test cricket and one-dayers."
Teams with T20I statusThe ten Test-playing nations  have permanent T20I status.
The nations are listed below with the date of each nation's T20I debut shown in brackets:Since 2005, the ICC has granted temporary ODI and T20I status to six other teams :Four other Associate Nations have held temporary ODI and T20I status as a result of World Cricket League performances, before being relegated after underperforming at the World Cup or World Twenty20 Qualifier:Cricket at international multi-sport eventsAjantha Mendis is the only player to have taken six wickets in a T20ICricket was played as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics , when England and France contested a two-day match.
Main article: List of Twenty20 International recordsThe highest team total in a T20I was made by Sri Lanka in 2007.
Facing Kenya, they scored 260 runs for the loss of six wickets , also granting them the largest winning margin.
Brendon McCullum has accrued the most runs in the format, and is the only batsman to have scored more than 2,000 runs.

Today, though, they didn't relent despite a poor start, and registered a welcome win albeit after the series was lost.
Lendl Simmons got his sixth fifty in his last eight innings, Kieron Pollard notched up his personal best against a Test-playing nation, Carlton Baugh again played the support role before taking the lead behind the stumps, Andre Russell smacked 25 off 14 before unsettling India with his bouncers, and Darren Sammy and Anthony Martin backed up expertly with their bowling, scalping six under-pressure batsmen between them.The 103-run win is West Indies' third-highest margin of victory over India in ODIs.
The highest is the 135-run win in Vijayawada in 2002.The 146 is India's sixth-lowest score against West Indies overall and their second lowest in the West Indies.India's 146 is their fifth-lowest score in ODIs since the beginning of 2008 .
Their lowest in the same period is 88 against Sri Lanka in Dambulla in 2008.The 96-run stand between Carlton Baugh and Kieron Pollard is the second-highest for the sixth wicket for West Indies in ODIs against India after the 118-run stand between Ricardo Powell and Nehemiah Perry in Singapore in 1999.Pollard's 70 is his fourth half-century and second-highest score in ODIs .
His highest is the 94 against Ireland in the 2011 World Cup.Anthony Martin's 4 for 36 is fourth on the list of best bowling performances by a West Indies bowler against India in ODIs since 2005.
In the same period, Ravi Rampaul's 5 for 51 in Chennai is the best.It was never going to be an easy win.
Not with Praveen Kumar and Amit Mishra in the kind of form they've been in.
The two bowled six maiden overs and took five wickets between them to undo Simmons' good work.
Simmons brought West Indies back from 41 for 2 through a counter-attack on the returning Ishant Sharma and on the dominant Mishra.
However, he saw his partner in recovery, Darren Bravo, pick out one of three fielders on the leg-side boundary to send West Indies into a tailspin that stopped with Simmons' run-out to make it 103 for 5 in the 27th over.This was Simmons' ninth innings out of 27 that ended between 40 and 77, a trend that flatters and then deceives.
However, another flatterer-and-deceiver forgot the deceiving part today.
Pollard played one of his more responsible international innings to pull West Indies out of trouble.After an edgy start, Pollard showed much better discretion and cricketing sense.
Hitting Manoj Tiwary for a straight six and a four in the 32nd over, he reached 19 off 19, and started working the singles.
Baugh reciprocated just like he had done with Russell two days ago.
There was a moment when Baugh should have been run out for 17, running casually with his bat in the air, but the umpire chose not to look at the replays.
That was not the first mistake Norman Malcolm made, nor was it the last.
His lbw call against Marlon Samuels was dodgy, as were a couple of wides, and he would go on to deny India another run-out in the last over of the innings.Pollard, meanwhile, was making all the right decisions.
The big shots and the singles were mixed well.
There was also a deft late-cut, and the big hits were aimed only down the ground.
Nor was there any urge to hit every delivery into the stands.
He went after Mishra only when he bowled flat.
He contributed 64 to the 96-run stand.
Having put India under pressure, Pollard holed out in the first over of the batting Powerplay that begun in the 44th over.That didn't stall the momentum, though, as Russell continued with his clean big striking, hitting three fours and a six to help West Indies get 57 in the Powerplay.
Having reached their best score of the season, West Indies were aggressive in defence.
The pitch wasn't as slow as the ones in the earlier matches, and Kemar Roach and Russell didn't bother about keeping some in the tank.
They went all out against the inexperienced top order, and Sammy was canny from the other end.India's slide began with Tiwary, who was jetlagged on debut when his stumps were clattered by Brett Lee and was now playing his comeback match as an opener, a role he is not accustomed to.
It showed as he struggled against the moving ball.
Nerves were on display too.
He almost ran himself out and was dropped off Roach before finally edging Sammy.
Parthiv Patel pulled, flicked and upper-cut well in scoring 26 of the 41 runs that came while he was at the crease.
Sammy, though, got rid of him with a smart one-handed return catch to his left.S Badrinath was then pinged by Russell's bouncers.
There was an air of helplessness in the way he moved about the crease, trying to get out of the way, looking for the upper-cut.
The struggle finally ended when he gloved a hook and was quick in rushing off the field.Martin, who is a firefighter in Antigua, then came on to give his full-time job a bad name.
Here were India facing the heat, and the fireman stoked the fire by scalping India's best batsman, Virat Kohli, in his first over and the innings' 21st.
Baugh, who had taken an overhead catch behind his body to send Badrinath back, now finished a flashy stumping as Kohli overbalanced for a split-second.
Under pressure, Suresh Raina looked for release, but slogged Martin straight to midwicket to make it 111 for 5.Yusuf Pathan soon did something similar to Simmons, but there was still one man West Indies needed to see the back of.
Rohit Sharma had denied them on two previous occasions in this series, but this time he top-edged a slog-sweep off Martin after having looked good for 39 off 47. Game over.2

Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , a non-profit organization.R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium  is a cricket stadium  on Khettarama Road, Maligawatta , Colombo , Sri Lanka.
The stadium was, before June 1994, known as the Khettarama Cricket Stadium and is today one of the main venues where the Sri Lankan cricket team play, having hosted more than 100 one day international matches .
It is the largest stadium in Sri Lanka with capacity of 35,000 spectators.
It has capacity exceeding Lord's Cricket Ground .
It is nicknamed "Home of Sri Lankan cricket".
It was also the stadium where the highest Test score was scored.The stadium is the brainchild of the late Sri Lankan president Ranasinghe Premadasa , who championed the development of this 40,000-seater concrete bowl, the biggest stadium in Sri Lanka.
Opened on 2 February 1986 with a match between a Sri Lanka 'B' side and an England 'B' team, the stadium was built on swampland previously used by monks ferrying across to the Khettarama temple adjacent to it.The inaugural One Day International was played on 9 March 1986, Sri Lanka v Pakistan .
On 28 August 1992 it hosted its inaugural Test match between Sri Lanka and Australia .
The venue is best remembered for holding the world record for the highest Test total – 952/6 declared by Sri Lanka against India in 1997/1998 in which former Sri Lanka captain Sanath Jayasuriya scored 340 and Roshan Mahanama 225, the pair sharing a partnership 576 for the second wicket, at that time it was the highest for any wicket in a Test Match.
In 10 February 2009 it hosted inaugural T20i match between Sri Lanka & India as well as 1st T20i to be played in Sri Lanka.A new training center has been developed behind the stadium with 16 practice pitches and dormitories for the Sony Max Cricket Academy which started in 2003.The Premadasa Stadium underwent a reconstruction project in preparation for the 2011 Cricket World Cup .
The stadium has been undergoing large-scale renovations since 2009.
It has had its seating capacity increase from 14,000 to 40,000, the media-box accommodating 200 journalists, and other upgrades.
The renovations have cost Sri Lanka Cricket $8 million.
In July 2010, a report filed by the ICC pitch consultant, Andy Atkinson, raised concerns over the condition of the outfield and the pitch claiming he was worried at the slow pace of progress.
The Test match was staged using temporary seating for spectators in a corner of the stadium as only players' pavilions had permanent arrangements.
Since the press box was not completed reporters and commentators facing technical difficulties used a makeshift arrangement.The main four public stands were refurbished along with the player dressing room area and the corporate boxes.
A VIP car park is in the northern end of the ground.Pavilions A and B are fully equipped with seating in two tiers, lower and higher.
Several corporate boxes are built in these two stands.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter CommentThere has been no other recent Indian team with players as desperate to prove a point and stake a claim as this oneThere must be a big balloon of gloom descending on the television companies broadcasting India's tour of West Indies.
How do you hype a series featuring an Indian team lacking its big stars and an opposition adamant about not including its star player?
The TV pundits always find an answer.
This is being billed as a sign of the future.
And this time, in the context of at least the Indian players, they may even be right.There has been no recent Indian team with so many players so desperate to prove a point and stake a claim as this one.
Until this series, the recent India story was about the ambitious march of a team to the top of the ladder: a Test series win in New Zealand, a series-levelling effort in South Africa, a World Cup triumph.
This series against West Indies is about the young and the restless India.
It's about assessing the hunger and the talent in these men.
There are quite a few players at an almost vital crossroads in their career.Leading them is a man who encompasses so much about this brave new talented India, but Suresh Raina comes with qualifications: "There is talent but …" When the triumvirate of Tendulkar, Laxman and Dravid eventually go, can the Rainas of India fill that gaping hole?For long Raina has been the antithesis of Rohit Sharma.
Not many have criticised Raina's "attitude"; in fact Rahul Dravid hailed him as among the more hardworking youngsters he's seen in recent times.
His short-ball woes put him in danger of being labelled as an ODI player, though.
In that respect he is treading the path of Michael Bevan.
While Raina would probably give a leg to own Bevan's ODI record, he will dread going Bevan's way in Tests.
Bevan's Test career was derailed by his problems against the short ball and Raina has to do something very quickly if he wants to avert similar free fall.For long Virat Kohli had been oscillating between Rohit and Raina.
Attitude problems dogged him but he, like Raina, seemed determined to get himself out of the doghouse.
Slowly, step by step, he has erased almost all his blots.
His game has improved considerably and on current form he appears the best of the younger lot to seize a middle-order spot in Tests.
And if Raina slips up, Kohli could well pounce on the captaincy as well.For long Rohit Sharma has been the antithesis of S Badrinath.
Opportunity and fame threatened to get the better of him and he wasn't perhaps mentally equipped to deal with them.
Critics singled out his lack of hunger.
No one raised a word about his talent despite his playing 61 ODIs for a below-par average of 27.13.
His fans have pointed to this year's IPL to show the winds of change are blowing; that he looks fitter, hungrier and has mended his ways.
This series will be the chance for him to offer some definitive proof.For long S Badrinath has been ploughing a lone field in the domestic dust bowls.
Anonymity is a luxurious cloak that superstars seek; Badrinath wants to be recognised.
For him the IPL wasn't about money, it wasn't about thrilling the crowds; it was about the basic human urge to get recognised and find a tiny spot on the global cricket map.
"When people say, 'that shot off Lee was good,' it's a little bit of recognition, and it's a little bit of happiness that gives you satisfaction," Badrinath said about playing in the IPL.For long Sreesanth has been waging a battle against himself; he has been the biggest ever reality show featuring an Indian cricketer.
His path to manhood played out on big flat plasma screens to billions of fans.
Again, like Rohit, his talent has been scarcely questioned but everyone and his uncle have been hammering on his temperament.For long Ishant Sharma has been living off that one demonic spell against Ricky Ponting.
Unlike Sreesanth or Rohit, his attitude has never been questioned.
Venkatesh Prasad, the former bowling coach, even nominated him as the most disciplined and hardworking aspirant.
Perhaps, in his case, he tried too much.
The left shoulder collapsed, the follow-through became a stutter, the wrists weren't behind the seam and the Indian fans were aghast and wary of another talent going the way of Irfan Pathan.
Luckily, things seem to be on the mend; the IPL offered brief glimpses of a positive change.For long Murali Vijay has flattered to deceive.
He looks a million bucks when he plays one of his flamboyant on-the-up shots but leaves you tearing your hair when he mis-hits one to a fielder.
And yet this is the same player who showed such restraint and sense of occasion on his debut Test against Australia, in which he rarely played a false shot.
If he can marry that kind of discipline with his talent, he can progress.
However, the jury is still out on his skill on tough pitches.
It's not to say that he doesn't have the talent to cope, but that he hasn't been tested yet.The West Indies is a place where even angels can be tempted to stray.
It's here that the young and restless India will begin their path to sobriety.
The sun is shining, the weather is sweet and the future is calling; are the boys listening?For ODI, I will suggest three changes in the Indian side -  Replace Dhawan with Tiwari.
Tiwari should play at number 6 and Rohit should open the batting with Parthiv Patel.Venkat_Super_11 on June  4, 2011, 20:18 GMTHi Sriram, this is an excellent article written with a touch of literature and a pinch of advice and encouragement and at the same time, invoking competition amongst the bench players.
Well done.
I was always a great fan of Siddharth Monga's articles.
And should I say, this article is very matured and so pleasing to read.
Well done Sriram.

His one ODI has gone for 10 overs 50-2 and was sacked after this exceptional performance against Zim http://www.espncricinfo.com/zim-tri2010/engine/current/match/452150.html
Besides I was talking about match winning effort AKA atleast 3 or 4 wickets in a match.
Its the least you expect of your main spinner!rockingsekhar on June  4, 2011,  8:38 GMTGood analysys and projection!!!!!!!!! Rohith Sharma should prove his worth this time, though his technique and game is absolutely perfect, but lacking the confidence and temperament, more than any one else in the current team, he will have to show what he has got, as others might get a chance to prove themselves, but with the competetion around ROHIT has to step up and show what he can do!!!!!! Wishing INDIA all the best!!!!!!! Wish you all the best Rohit Sharma, Badhrinath and all the young lads!!!!!!!!!on June  4, 2011,  8:30 GMTI feel that Ishant Sharma needs another chance to prove.
I think he can prove that he is India's fastest bowler and best.on

Hope they all prove a Point.
Sorry to say, No more chance to be given for Nohit Sharma at least for a year.
Rahane misses out but every1 can't be selected But selectors should look at Rahane instead of Nohit Sharma's.
Thank God, the selectors are sensible enough to Look at Domestic Performances not IPL Alone.ssenthil on June  4, 2011,  5:50 GMT@maddy20, SO sorry for your NO Cricket Knowledge, Ashwin Haven't played a Single Match against Zimbabwe.
He has a Bowling Avg of 23.22 and a E Rate of 4.86 and Mostly Bowled during the Power-plays and Death-overs unlike any other Indian Spinner, Have a Right Cricket Knowledge before writing.US_Indian on June  4, 2011,  5:27 GMTI would really like to see the BCCI and selectors restore their faith in Kaif, he had been treated badly and never given his due share,he was so unlucky in one match he scores a century and the next he is found warming the bench, unlike Rohits and Yuvraj's.
I believe he should be given atleast a couple of chances and i think he along with Badri can act as the bridge between the ageing superstars and future young guns in the middle order and on any given day his fielding is an asset.
This is ironic that a future indian captain has seen this kind of days, and if selectors show some faith in him he may bounce back and provide the much needed experience and stability to the middle order.on
June  4, 2011,  4:26 GMTReally think Manish Pandey should have been given a go.
Scored tons of runs this domestic season, scored in the Irani trophy final and also did reasonably well for the Pune Warriors.
Better than Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan in the ODI team in my opinion.Chetan007 on June  4, 2011,  3:45 GMTdeserves a chance in the team.Not only for their captaincy skills but they are the players who can play some good knocks in the pressure situation too where many Indian players failed in the past.In IPL4 i don't find that S. Tiwari was out of touch.He was playing good.But playing such down the order with the skills of playing at no.4 is always difficult.Even RCB has bought good players in the team but their man management skills was too bad.They could even won the final or have given a good fight to CSK if their players was played to the spot as their skill not with the star value.
look what MI done last year,they had tried to give S. Tiwari a chance up the order look at the  results.This year too they tried to give chance to Rayudu but latter they also consider the star value more than what team required.And at last what happen known to everyone.I just want to ask selectors what is the criteria of selection?Is the players with good temprament,good skills doesn't deserves 2 be in team.Chetan007 on June  4, 2011,  3:32 GMTI agree to TRAM.
Kohli is not the future good captain of India.
His teprament is not honed to that much as he deserves to be the Captain of an Indian national Cricket team.
He could be sucessful in domestic as well as some small series.
But the weak point is M. Vijay.
He is better to only in Indian condition.
Though he played some good knocks outside.
but his playing style changes. he is rather not able to find the way for the ball.
See how Mukund able to over the weakness of our top order in the absence of Shewag and Gambhir.
I think so Sourabh Tiwari should get a chance in ODI and T20I.
As furtue i think so he has the capability to lead the team .
He has lead the Jharkhand team as well in few occasions and shown how good he is.
Rayudu has also a good leadership qualities then Kohli See the world cup records under the captaincy of Rayudu.
The only match they lost in the U-19 world cup when he was out due to one match ban due to 1 over slow over rate in a tough game.
So these YoungsterTRAM on June  4, 2011,  1:36 GMTExcuse me, why do people brand Kholi as future captain of India?
Has he shown any 'cool' like Dhoni, or has he shown brilliant captaincy tricks that others were amazed with?
When will this branding players  stop?
I am not saying anything about his batting.
He is good and like MVijay, Badri, Raina, etc he needs to be tested in pace-bowler-friendly track.
I seriously wish WI make all their pitches like the olden days Barbados.
It will help us bring out the men from the boys.SRT_GENIUS on June  3, 2011, 21:27 GMTKohli is the future captain of India.
But he needs to work on his fitness more - currently he is living off his genes & youth.MasterClass on June  3, 2011, 19:40 GMTThe main reason I'm excited about this tour to the WI is BECAUSE the youngsters are playing instead of the seniors!
Just bummed that Pujara is injured and won't be playing.
BUT look forward to Mukund making his debut in TEST!
I'm sure plenty of other Indian fans feel the same way.
So FINALLY we get to see the young guard!
Let's make sure BCCI, media, dooms-day pundits, etc. hear our voice by voting with our eyeballs and checkbooks.
Also, very glad Dravid, Laxman and Zak are there for guidance.
Couldn't pick any better seniors for the youngsters to learn from.
Only quibble...Bhajji as VC? Huh? Hummmm...on June  3, 2011, 19:19 GMTi think this will be really interesting match up.
i want to see rahane, karthik, varun aaron and pujara perform.
Pujara has a brilliant technique.
i hope Irfan Pathan wud get a chance again sometime in future.
Murali vijay needs an attitude upgrade.
i am sure tht Ashwin is brilliant in subcontinent, it wud be interesting to see him in the caribean.and

He was the coach of the England cricket team from 1999-2007, and is credited with the resurgence of the England team in Test cricket in the early years of the 2000s.Fletcher was born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia  and was one of five brothers in a Rhodesian farming family.Career as playerCareer as coachUnder Fletcher the England cricket team achieved famous series victories away to Sri Lanka, Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa between 2000-2004.
In 2004 England won an English record 8 consecutive tests, beating New Zealand 3-0 and West Indies 4-0 at home respectively, before winning the first test in South Africa.
His most famous and largest achievement however came in September 2005, when he became the first coach of the English team to win an Ashes series for 18 years when England secured 2-1 victory over Australia.In recognition of this winning the Ashes after 18 years, Fletcher was conferred with the OBE .
On 13 September 2005 Fletcher was awarded British citizenship after a five-year wait.
Although both his parents and all his grandparents were ethnically English, i.e. of English/British descent, Fletcher had been denied citizenship by virtue of the fact he spent most of his time abroad—touring with the England team.
After the Ashes series win of 2005, the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke , intervened to award Fletcher his long-sought citizenship.
Fletcher received heavy criticism from all quarters after preferring Ashley Giles to Monty Panesar as England's main spinner in the first two Tests of the 2006-07 Ashes series ; Giles took three wickets in two Tests, while Panesar, when given the chance in the third Test, took five wickets in the first innings and three wickets in the second innings.
Following defeat to Australia by 206 runs in the third test on 18 December 2006 which saw England relinquish the Ashes 15 months after gaining them, the England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed that Fletcher's position as head coach was under review.
Despite a brief reprieve in early 2007 when England won the Commonwealth Bank Series , Fletcher came under increased criticism as England performed poorly in the World Cup , which culminated in a nine wicket loss to South Africa in which the team were booed off the field by England's Barmy Army.
It was later announced, on 19 April 2007, that his 8-year tenure as coach was to end following England's final Super 8 match against the West Indies on Saturday 21 April 2007.England's test record improved almost as soon as Fletcher took over in 1999, however the fortunes of the one-day side plummeted under Fletcher and ironically the only major success in one day cricket under the Fletcher era came a mere three months before his exit, as England won the Commonwealth Bank Series by defeating Australia early in 2007.In November 2007 Fletcher confirmed that he was considering a switch to rugby, stating "I'd like to be a rugby consultant.
I have some ideas...I love my rugby, I would rather watch rugby than cricket.
I'm passionate about it, it's the game I'd like to have been involved in."In
November 2008 it was announced that Fletcher would take on a consultancy role with Hampshire for the 2009 season, Fletcher has been appointed as the coach of the India cricket team on 27 April 2011,  Under the coach of Duncan Fletcher, India national cricket team achieved 8 series victory in a row in 2013 including Champions Trophy.Fletcher's sister, Ann Grant captained the Zimbabwe women's field hockey team which won the gold medal in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow .^

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Fast bowler Graham Onions bowling for Durham against Lancashire in the 2012 Friends Life t20Fast bowling, sometimes known as pace bowling, is one of the two main approaches to bowling in the sport of cricket .
The other is spin bowling .
Practitioners are usually known as fast bowlers , fastmen, pace bowlers, quicks, or pacemen, although sometimes the label refers to the specific fast bowling technique the bowler prefers, such as swing bowler or seam bowler.The aim of fast bowling is to bowl the hard cricket ball at high speed and to induce it to bounce off the pitch in an erratic fashion or move sideways through the air, factors which make it difficult for the batsman to hit the ball cleanly.
A typical fast delivery has a speed in the range of 137–153 km/h .Categorisation of fast bowlingIt is possible for a bowler to concentrate solely on speed, especially when young, but as fast bowlers mature they pick up new skills and tend to rely more on swing bowling or seam bowling techniques.
Most fast bowlers will specialise in one of these two areas and will sometimes be categorised as swing or seam bowler.
However, this classification is not satisfactory because the categories are not mutually exclusive and a skilled bowler will usually bowl a mixture of fast, swinging, seaming and also cutting balls, even if he prefers one style to the others.
Also, due to pitch and weather conditions, it may be almost unsustainable to bowl to their full potential pace, meaning a fast bowler could average at a high 130 km/h instead of low 140 km/h, or a fast-medium bowler may extract more pace and bowl quicker than their average pace.There is a degree of subjectivity in the usage of these terms; for example, Cricinfo uses the terms "fast-medium" and "medium-fast" interchangeably, Technique in fast bowlingThis section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .The first thing a fast bowler needs to do is to grip the ball correctly.
The basic fast bowling grip to achieve maximum speed is to hold the ball with the seam upright and to place the index and middle fingers close together at the top of the seam with the thumb gripping the ball at the bottom of the seam.
The image to the right shows the correct grip.
The first two fingers and the thumb should hold the ball forward of the rest of the hand, and the other two fingers should be tucked into the palm.
The ball is held quite loosely so that it leaves the hand easily.
Other grips are possible, and result in different balls - see swing and seam bowling below.
The bowler usually holds their other hand over the hand gripping the ball until the latest possible moment so that the batsman cannot see what typeA fast bowler needs to take a longer run-up toward the wicket than a spinner, due to the need to generate the momentum and rhythm required to bowl a fast delivery.
Fast bowlers will measure their preferred run up in strides and mark the distance from the wicket.
It is important for the bowler to know exactly how long his or her run-up is because it needs to terminate at the popping crease .
If the bowler steps over this, he or she will have bowled a no ball .
A no ball means the bowler will have to bowl again, awards a penalty of one or two runs to the batting team, and allows them to score additional runs with a reduced risk of dismissal.Brett Lee bowling against South Africa at the WACA in 2005This section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .At the end of the run-up the bowler will bring his lead foot down on the pitch with the knee as straight as possible.
This aids in generating speed but can be dangerous due to the pressure placed on the joint by this action.
Knee injuries are not uncommon amongst fast bowlers: for example, the English pace bowler David Lawrence was sidelined for many months after splitting his kneecap in two.
The pressure on the leading foot is such that some fast bowlers cut the front off their shoes to stop their toes from being injured as they are repeatedly pressed against the inside of the shoe.
The bowler will then bring their bowling arm up over their head and release the ball at the height appropriate to where they want the ball to pitch.
Again, the arm must be straight although this is a stipulation of the laws of cricket rather than an aid to speed.
Bending the elbow and "chucking" the ball would make it too easy for the bowler to aim accurately at the batsman's wicket and get them out.Mitchell Johnson bowling.
Note the "sling shot" action.Fast bowlers tend to have an action which leaves them either side-on or chest-on at the end of the run up.
A chest on bowler has chest and hips aligned towards the batsman at the instant of back foot contact , while a side on bowler has chest and hips aligned at ninety degrees to the batsman at the instant of back foot contact.
West Indian bowler Malcolm Marshall was a classic example of a chest on bowler, while Australian pace bowler Dennis Lillee used a side on technique to great effect.While a bowler's action does not affect the speed at which they bowl, it can limit the style of balls that they can bowl.
Although this is not a hard and fast rule, side on bowlers generally bowl outswingers , and front on bowlers generally bowl inswingers .A variant on the fast bowler's action is the sling , where the bowler begins his delivery with his or her arm fully extended behind their back.
The slinging action generates extra speed, but sacrifices control.
The most famous exponent of the slinging action is Jeff Thomson , who bowled at extraordinary pace off a short run up.
Current internationals who employ a slinging action include Fidel Edwards , Shaun Tait , Lasith Malinga and Mitchell Johnson .Matthew Hoggard begins his follow-through in training.After the ball has been released, the bowler "follows through" at the end of his or her action.
This involves veering to the side so as not to tread on the pitch and taking a few more strides to slow down.
Striding on to the pitch at the end of a delivery can damage the surface resulting in rough patches which spin bowlers can exploit to get extra turn on the ball; doing so is illegal according to the laws of the game.
Bowlers who persistently run onto the pitch can be warned, with three warnings disqualifying a bowler from bowling again during the innings .Line and lengthThis section does not cite any references or sources .
Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources .
Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .An effective fast bowler needs to be able to hold a consistent line and length , or in common terms, to be accurate.
In this context, line refers to the path of the ball towards the batsman, in the horizontal dimension running from the off to the leg side, while length describes the distance the ball travels toward the batsman before bouncing.
Variations in length is generally seen as the more important of the two for a fast bowler.
The faster the bowler, the harder it is to achieve consistent line and length but sheer speed can make up for the shortfall.
Fast bowlers who also manage to be accurate can be devastatingly effective, for example the likes of Australian pace bowler Glenn McGrath and South African pace bowler Shaun Pollock .In modern cricket, the two lines usually aimed for by fast bowlers is the so-called corridor of uncertainty , the area just outside the batsman's off stump , or actually on the stumps.
It is difficult for the batsman to tell whether or not such a ball is likely to strike their wicket, and thus to know whether to attack, defend or leave the ball.
This technique was historically known as off theory , but it is now so routine that it is rarely given a name at all, or forgotten about completely.
Of course, variation in line is also important and deliveries aimed at the leg stump can also serve a purpose.Precise mastery of the line of the ball is best utilised when a batsman is known to have a weakness hitting a particular shot, because a bowler with an effective line can place the ball in the weak spot time after time.
Failing to overcome a persistent inability to hit balls on a certain line has been enough to end the careers of innumerable batsmen once they had been found out by skilled line bowlers.This section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .A good length ball or salmon ball is one that arrives at the batsman at around waist height.
There is no fixed distance to a good length, or indeed any other length of ball in cricket since the distance required will vary with the speed of the ball, the state of the pitch and the height of the bowler and batsman.
It should be noted that bowling a "good length" in this sense is not always appropriate - in some situations, on some pitches and against some batsmen other lengths will be more effective.
The diagram to the right should help explain what the different lengths mean.A ball which bounces a little way before the good length and rises to the batsman's abdomen is said to be short pitched or described as a long hop and is easier for a batsman to hit as he will have had more time to see if the height or line of the ball has deviated after bouncing.
A short-pitched ball is also at a more suitable height for the batsman to play an attacking pull shot .
A ball which bounces significantly before the good length and reaches shoulder or head height is a bouncer and can be an effective delivery.
Any ball which is short enough to bounce over the batsman's head is usually called wide by the Umpire .
Bowling short pitched or wide balls is a bad idea as they are relatively easy for the batsman to defend or attack.At the other end of the scale, balls which bounce slightly closer to the batsman than the good length are said to be full pitched or overpitched or described as a half volley.
These are often easier for the batsman to play than the good length because they do not have time to move much after bouncing off the seam and, arriving at the batsmen low to the ground, are ideal for drive strokes.
However, in conditions favourable to swing bowling full pitched bowling gives the ball more time to move through the air challenging the batsman weigh up the risk of being able to play drives against uncertainty about the swing.
Closer still to the batsman's feet is the yorker .
an effective yorker's length will be difficult to pick early forcing the batsman back into the crease.
Additionally, because it bounces at the batsmen's feet, a well bowled yorker is not playable by a conventional cricket shot.
If the ball fails to bounce at all before reaching the batsman it is labelled a full toss or beam ball.
It is very easy for a batsman to play such a delivery as it will not have deviated at all from bouncing off the pitch.It is because the three effective lengths  are all interspersed by lengths which are easy for the batsman to hit that control of length is an important discipline for a fast bowler.
Spin bowlers on the other hand are almost always aiming for the good length but need a much finer control of flight and line to be effective.
A fast bowler tries to be physically fit throughout his cricket career, which may span more than a decade.
Needless to say that is tough to do and needs a lot of discipline and luck.This section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .Strike bowling is the term usually applied to bowlers that are used mainly to get a batsman out at the possible expense of runs if the wicket-taking is unsuccessful.
For fast bowlers, this can be achieved through sheer speed and aggression, rather than trying to make the ball move through the air or off the pitch.
More commonly however, aggressive bowling techniques can be combined with swing bowling and seam bowling techniques to create nigh-on unplayable balls in the hands of a bowler of any speed.
The inswinging yorker is seen as particularly deadly.A bouncer is a ball which is aimed to pitch in the first half of the pitch, meaning it has had time to rise sharply to chest or head height by the time it reaches the batsman.
This causes two problems for the batsman who receives the ball.
If he or she attempts to play it, their bat will be at eye-level making it difficult for them to watch the ball onto the bat and time their shot correctly.
If he or she leaves or misses the ball, it may strike him or her a painful blow on the head or chest and occasionally result in injury.
For this reason, bowling spells containing many bouncers are said to be intimidatory bowling.The usual response to a bouncer is for the batsman simply to duck underneath it, but this requires fast reflexes and a strong nerve and the batsman is sometimes hit in any case.
The natural reflex is to attempt to defend one's head with a straight bat but this should be suppressed if possible as the likely result of this will be that the ball flies off the bat at an uncontrolled angle making for an easy catch .
Most batsman have panicked and lost their wickets in this fashion several times in their career after prolonged spells of bouncers.Physically powerful batsmen often attempt to strike the ball on the rise, even though this obstructs their vision of the ball since it is not uncommon that their sheer brute force combined with the speed of the ball will cause it to fly to the boundary.
This possibility, combined with the difficulty that the wicketkeeper will have trying to stop a high ball means that bouncers can be expensive in terms of runs against skilled batsmen.This section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .A slower ball is a ball which is delivered exactly like a usual pace delivery in terms of action and run-up but where the grip is changed slightly in order to slow the ball down.
This deceives the batsman, who will likely attempt to play the ball as though it were at full speed, causing him or her to mistime their shot.
The result is usually that the ball strikes lower down the bat resulting in it leaving the bat at a slower speed .
Also, the bat will generally have travelled further when it hits the ball and be in the upward part of its arc, causing the ball to leave the bat at a steeper angle.
The combination of these can be a slow-moving, looping ball which is relatively easy to catch.
In an extreme case, the batsman will play the shot so early as to completely play over the ball, and be clean-bowled .One of a number of different grips is illustrated to the right.
Essentially the only difference is that the middle and index fingers are split and come down on each side of the seam.
This causes more drag on the ball as it leaves the hand, slowing down the delivery.
Slower balls are also bowled by using the off break grip and finger action used by off spinners .
A slower delivery may also be achieved - less commonly - by using a leg spin grip and wrist action or by supporting the upper aspect of the ball with only one finger or with the knuckles.The slower ball is particularly effective against a batsman seeking to score quickly.
Consequently, its prominence has increased with the development of one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket , and particularly when " bowling at the death "  where batsman will attack with abandon.A more experienced batsman will be able to adjust his/her shot mid-stroke, momentarily pausing so as to middle the ball when it is hit.Another version of the slower ball also known as the SLOB, is released with the top fingers only.
Aimed as a "beamer", the method of delivery causes the ball to drop dramatically in flight and arrive at a yorker length.
This was most famously used by Chris Cairns to Chris Read causing him to duck into a full length ball which went on to the stumps .This section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .A yorker is a ball which bounces off the pitch right in front of  the batsman's feet, an area known as the block hole.
Because of the usual stance of the batsman and the regulation length of the cricket bat the bat is not usually held near the ground while the batsman prepares to strike the ball, so playing a yorker requires the batsman to alter the height of his or her bat very quickly after detecting a yorker has been bowled.
This is difficult, and the yorker can often squeeze through the gap and break the wicket.
Successfully playing this type of delivery is also known as digging out a yorker.Bowling a yorker requires pinpoint accuracy since bowling it slightly too long will result in a full toss or full pitched delivery which is easy for the batsman to play because the ball has not deviated by bouncing off the pitch.
It also has most of its value as a surprise ball.
For these two reasons, yorkers are not common deliveries in most circumstances.In the latter stages of an innings in one day cricket , batters seek to attack every ball bowled.
In such circumstances, the yorker is a particularly effective delivery, both in taking wickets and preventing boundaries from being hit.
Therefore, the yorker is very frequently bowled in these circumstances, and bowlers who can bowl yorkers accurately are prized in this form of cricket.Pakistani fast bowlers Imran Khan , Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram , and the West Indian fast bowler Joel Garner , and also Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga are widely regarded as amongst the best exponents of yorkers.Andrew Flintoff of England bowls in the nets, watched by Kevin Shine .
Note the upright seamThis section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .Seam bowling is the act of using the seam of the ball to cause the ball to bounce in an unpredictable fashion when it hits the pitch.
A good batsman will be able to predict where a ball is going to bounce and from that work out what height the ball will be when it reaches him or her.
By generating variations in bounce, the bowler can make it more likely the batsman will make a mistake in his assessment of the ball and give away their wicket.Seam deliveries can be bowled at any pace, but most specialist seamers bowl at medium, medium-fast or fast-medium pace.
The basic technique of seam bowling is to employ the normal fast bowling or slower ball grip and to try to ensure that the seam remains upright until the ball hits the pitch.
If the seam is upright and the ball is spinning around its horizontal axis, there is no appreciable Magnus effect and the ball will not move in the air.
The seam of the ball is raised and will cause variations in bounce and movement if it is the first part of the ball to hit the pitch.Seam bowlers can get a lot of help from certain types of pitches.
Hard pitches that have a cracked or ridged surface are best for seam bowling since the hardness makes it easier to bounce the ball without losing speed while the uneven surface adds to the unpredictability of the bounce when the ball hits the pitch.
This is known as variable bounce.
On rare occasions a pitch which is extremely hard and uneven will be declared as too dangerous to play on since the batsman cannot predict the ball at all and they are likely to be hit on the body repeatedly as a result.
Green pitches can also assist the seam bowler since the tiny tufts of grass represent an uneven surface although this is a mixed blessing since the green surface also slows the ball slightly.
It is difficult for a seam bowler to be effective on a very flat and even-surfaced pitch  and seamers usually resort to aggressive bowling tactics and/or bowling cutters on such surfaces.Main articles: Leg cutter and Off cutterThis section does not cite any references or sources .
Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources .
Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .A cutter is a fast ball that is spinning, that is, a delivery that is rotating around the opposite axis to the seam instead of keeping the seam straight.
While this rotation is nowhere near as much as that achieved by a spin bowler, the small variations it can produce are still enough to make a batsman uncomfortable due to the speed of the ball.
Cutters can be an effective way for a seam bowler to get the ball to move if he or she is not receiving much assistance from the pitch.A ball rotating around the seam will move either right or left when it hits the pitch, depending on which way the ball is spinning.
A ball bouncing to the right is said to be an off cutter as it is travelling from off stump to leg stump for a right-handed batsman.
Conversely, a ball which bounces to the left is a leg cutter, travelling from leg to off stump for a right-handed batsman.
Cutters are usually aimed so that they hit the pitch just outside the batsman's off stump and move away from the wicket.
This will cause the ball to catch the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle and fly up to be caught in the slips .To bowl a cutter, the bowler employs a different grip.
The two grips are shown to the right, with the uppermost one producing a leg cutter while the lower one shows the grip required for an off cutter .
As well as changing the grip, the bowler must pull his or her fingers down the appropriate side of the ball as it leaves their hand in order to impart the required spin.
The action of bowling a cutter also increases drag on the ball as it leaves the hand, causing the ball to slow in the same way as a slower ball and this can also help to confuse the batsman.This section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .Swing bowlers cause the ball to move laterally through the air, rather than off the pitch like seam bowlers.
Normal or conventional swing bowling is encouraged by the raised seam of the ball,  and conventional swing is usually greatest when the ball is new and therefore has a pronounced seam.
As the ball gets older, the wear makes swing more difficult to achieve, but this can be countered if the fielding team systematically polishes one side of the ball while allowing the other to become rough.
When the ball has been polished highly on one side and not on the other and if the ball is bowled very fast , it produces a reverse swing such that the ball swings in the opposite direction as in conventional swing.
Contrary to popular opinion, this swing is not produced by air flowing faster over the smooth or "shiny" side as compared to the rough side.Swing is produced due to a net force acting on the ball from one side; that is, the side with the more turbulent boundary layer .
For conventional swing bowling, the raised seam and the direction in which it is pointed governs the direction of swing.
Due to the angled seam of the ball, air flowing over the seam produces turbulence on the side that the seam is angled toward.
This causes the boundary layer to separate from the surface of the ball later .
As explained by Bernoulli's principle , there is a net pressure differential due to the greater pressure on the side with the more intact boundary layer.
The resulting net force acts so as to move or swing the ball in the direction of the angled seam.
Conventional swing bowling is delivered with the seam angled such that the smooth or polished side of the ball faces forward to move the ball in the direction of the seam i.e. toward the rough side.A swinging ball is classed as either an outswinger, which moves away from the batsman, or an inswinger, which moves in toward the batsman.
In most cases the outswinger is seen as the more dangerous ball because, if the batsman fails to recognise it, it will catch the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle and fly up to be caught in the slips .
Inswingers have their place too, especially combined with the yorker as this can result in the ball either breaking the wicket .Swing bowling can also be roughly categorised as early swing or late swing, corresponding to when in the trajectory the ball will change direction - the later the ball swings, the less chance the batter has of adjusting his/her shot to account for the swing.Swing balls are bowled with the same grip and technique as fast balls although the seam is usually angled slightly rather than straight, and the slower ball grip may be used.
For an outswinger the shiny side of the ball is nearest the batsman and the seam is angled away from him while for an inswinger, the rough side needs to be nearest the batsman and the seam angled toward them.
It is difficult to achieve swing with a cutter grip since the ball will spin in flight, varying the orientation of the shiny and rough surfaces as it moves through the air.
Many players, commentators on the game, and fans agree that swing is easier to achieve in humid or overcast conditions, and also that the red ball used in Test cricket swings more than the white ball used in the one-day game .Reverse swing is a phenomenon which causes the ball to swing in the opposite direction to that usually produced by the orientation of the shiny and rough sides of the ball.
This means that an older ball is more likely to be delivered with reverse swing as its surface will have been roughened through use.In reverse swing the seam is angled in the same way as in conventional swing  but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent.
The net effect of the seam and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where the seam is pointing to.
The turbulent boundary layer separating later is similar to the effect produced by dimples in a golf ball.
In case of the golf ball, turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball and the net effect is a later separation of boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a lower net drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back - this enables the golf ball to travel farther.The discovery of reverse swing is credited to Pakistan's cricketers, with Sarfraz Nawaz and Farrakh Khan both named as originators of the delivery.
Now, in one-day cricket the mandatory two new balls rule  means that the chances of reverse swing are reduced drastically.
With two new balls being used, the amount of wear that each ball is subject to is half as compared to usual.See also: Inswinger and OutswingerThis section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .A dipper is a swinging ball which is deliberately bowled as a yorker or a full toss , the latter not normally being a ball that a fast bowler would choose to bowl.
The indipper moves in to the right-handed batsman while the outdipper moves away.In order to be effective, a dipper has to generate a lot of swing to make up for the variation in movement lost because the ball is not bouncing on the pitch.
However, because the batsman usually expects a full toss to be an easy ball to score off, dippers have huge surprise value and can be extremely difficult to play especially if the bowler is very accurate and manages the yorker rather than a genuine full toss.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .Intimidatory or aggressive bowling is a legitimate tactic of bowling with the intent of hitting the batsman with the ball.
This is somewhat restrained by some of the laws of cricket, including those which disallow excessive use of bouncers and any use of the "beamer", which is aimed directly at the head on the full.
Successful intimidatory bowling usually employs a mixture of bouncers and short-pitched deliveries aimed at the batsman's head, chest, and rib cage.
The intention is to disrupt a batsman's focus, and ultimately induce a mistake that leads to the loss of the batsman's wicket.
Often the eventual wicket will not fall to a bouncer or short-pitched ball, but instead to a more standard delivery that the batsman is no longer expecting, or is rendered temporarily unable to play in his usual way .One classic approach is to deliver several short balls into the batsman's chest, forcing the batsman onto the back foot to defend with a high bat, and then fire in a fast yorker, aimed at the base of the stumps.
If the batsman is expecting to play a high back foot defensive, the time it takes to shift their weight to play the ball at their feet may just be enough for the delivery to surprise the batsman and cause him or her to panic, and thus cause the loss of their wicket.A fast bowler can also employ intimidatory tactics to anger  a batsman into playing a rash shot, by directing the ball to strike the batsman.
Intimidatory bowling plays a part in every fast bowler's attack to some degree, and even the best batsmen sometimes sustain serious injuries that can force them off the field and out of the game.
In almost all instances verbal 'sledging' accompanies the attack.Excessive use of intimidatory tactics by elite fast bowlers is considered unsportsmanlike , and is shunned by many teams and players.
One instance of excessive use was the Bodyline series, where the English Cricket Captain at the time .This section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .Because nearly all cricket teams will contain several fast bowlers of differing speeds and styles, the tactics of fast bowling depends not only on changing the field placements but on changing the bowler and the types and sequences of deliveries bowled as well.
The precise tactics will be determined by many factors including the state of the game, the state of the pitch, the weather and the relative energy and skill levels of the various players available to bowl.Fast bowling requires a great deal of energy and most fast bowlers can be expected to bowl a spell of 4-6 overs in a row before requiring a rest.
Depending on conditions, they may be required by the team to bowl a longer spell although this usually results in drop in effectiveness toward the end of the spell as the bowler tires.
Choosing which balls to bowl as part of a spell and what order to bowl them in is a tactical discipline all of its own.Deployment of bowlersThis section does not cite any references or sources .
Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources .
Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .Most sides contain a mixture of fast bowlers who specialise in aggressive and/or seam techniques and those who specialise in swing.
When the ball is new it usually swings very little but it will generate a lot of speed, bounce and variation off the seam .
So seam bowlers are usually chosen to bowl with the new ball either at the start of an innings or when a new ball has been taken, an option the fielding side has once a ball is 80 overs old.
In contrast, swing bowlers are more effective once the ball has started to wear and reverse swing requires a well worn ball.
Reverse swing bowlers can continue to extract large amounts of movement from balls well over 80 overs old.Two seam bowlers are usually expected to bowl in tandem for the first 10 or so overs, after which time the ball may begin to swing and one or both of them is substituted for a swing bowler or a spin bowler .
This is why most sides opt to include at least two seam bowlers who are known as opening bowlers.
Seam bowling usually becomes very ineffective with older balls and is virtually useless after 60 overs or so and as a result the bowling places in the side are filled with swing or spin bowlers.Deployment of fieldersThis section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .Fielding for a fast bowler is usually aggressive, that is to say that it is set up for the purpose of getting a wicket rather than preventing the flow of runs.
On occasion, particularly when the fielding team is batting last and is chasing a total, a defensive field is required.
As a general rule it is difficult to bowl defensive fast bowling - that task is better suited to spin bowlers.The various techniques of fast bowling lend themselves to three ways of getting the batsman out.
They may be bowled or caught LBW either by speed, the yorker or by seam or swing causing the ball to move in toward them, in which case placement of fielders is irrelevant.
Swing or seam may be employed to move the ball away from the batsman in which case the ball will strike the outside edge of the bat and may be caught in the slips.
A badly-played bouncer will either fly off the outside edge as above or may result in a mistimed shot that can be caught near the boundary.It follows that the most effective field placements for aggressive fast bowling are to pack the outfield and the slips cordon and gully since these are the positions in which the batsman is most likely to be caught.
Placing fielders in the outfield has the additional benefit of limiting the number of places where a batsman can score a boundary .
Other close fielding positions such as silly mid on/off and the various midwicket and cover positions are generally redundant.In contrast, a defensive field for fast bowling will pack the positions such as gully, point and cover in a full circle round the batsman.
One or two slips and one or two outfielders will remain in case of a catch.
Because batsmen usually try and play shots down on to the ground rather than risking being caught this field can stop most boundaries while remaining close enough to the pitch to attempt to run out the batsmen if they attempt a single.
Defensive fast bowling is difficult because a skilled batsman set this type of field will simply trust his or her technique and score from boundaries that they hit over the midwicket ring and away from any outfielders present.Bowling an overThis section does not cite any references or sources .
Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources .
Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .The primary goal of any bowler is to take the wicket of the batsman.
The secondary goal is to prevent the batsman scoring runs.
The latter is often a route to the former as a batsman deprived of runs will often become frustrated and is more likely to attempt risky shots in order to score.
In addition, stopping the batsman from scoring will usually mean that the bowler gets to bowl several consecutive balls at the same batsman, giving them the opportunity to set up some kind of tactical sequence.Counter-intuitively, the best approach for a fast bowler is not to aim consistent balls at the wicket as this prompts an obvious and easy response.
The batsman can simply defend his or her wicket and pick off the occasional bad ball.
A far more effective approach is to create uncertainty by bowling a line and length at which the batsman is unsure as to whether they should attack, defend or leave and by mixing up the types of delivery so the batsman is never sure what type of ball is coming next.
The majority of balls in a well-bowled spell will usually be swinging or seaming balls that pass at waist height, just outside the off stump and move away from the batsman because this is the area where it is most difficult for the batsman to choose the most appropriate response.
Common variations and their tactical application are discussed below.The precise balls chosen by the bowler during an over will depend on the situation of the match, the skill of the batsman and how settled the batsman is at the crease.
It is common to attack batsmen who have recently come to the wicket with successive short-pitched balls or bouncers with the dual aim of getting them out and stopping them from settling into an attacking mode of play for as long as possible.
Short balls are more risky against batsmen who have settled at the crease since they make easy boundaries, but most bowlers will still mix a few in during a spell, just to keep the batsman guessing.Most batsmen prefer to play shots off either the front or back foot and this will influence the bowlers' choice of balls.
It is difficult to play short balls off the front foot so bowlers will bowl more short balls at batsmen who prefer the front foot.
Likewise, it is hard to play yorkers and full pitched balls off the back foot so those are the deliveries of choice against back foot players.
If a bowler can successfully get a batsman playing off his or her less-favoured foot with a sequence of appropriately pitched balls he can then gain an element of surprise by suddenly throwing down the opposite kind of ball - a yorker after a succession of short balls or a bouncer after a succession of full balls.
An unobservant or complacent batsman can easily be caught unawares and lose their wicket.Another variation, especially against batsmen who have settled at the wicket and are starting to score more freely, is to switch the line of attack from the area just outside the off stump to bowling directly at leg stump.
The batsman has to react to these balls as he otherwise runs a high risk of being bowled or trapped LBW but as he or she does so his or her bat moves over to the leg side, leaving the off side vulnerable.
If the bowler can induce enough movement to the off side with swing or seam techniques it will often catch the outside edge of the bat offering a catch or strike the stumps directly.Surprise is a big element in bowling, and bowlers will often shun common tactical approaches in the hope of simply confusing the batsman into playing the wrong shot.
For example, bowling a yorker at a new batsman who will likely be expecting bouncers or at least standard line and length balls has been the cause of many batsmen losing their wicket first ball.This section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .In most cricketing countries, fast bowlers are considered to be the mainstay of a team's bowling attack, with slower bowlers in support roles.
On the Indian subcontinent , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka , the reverse is often true, with fast bowlers serving mainly to soften the ball up for the spinners.
This is largely due to the condition of the pitches used in those countries which gives more help to spinners than to fast bowlers, but at international level it is also a reflection of the outstanding skills of their spinners compared to their pace bowlers.
Pakistan , however, is an exception in the subcontinent with a rich history of producing high quality fast bowlers .Risks of injuriesThe human body is not built for the work load of fast bowling.
Fast bowling puts extreme pressure on the whole body, especially the feet, back and the shoulder.
It puts a lot of body parts under extreme risk of injury.
There is a risk of stress fractures in the ankles because of the feet landing hard on the ground at the time of delivery, back spasms and strains because of the arching movement when the ball is delivered and torn ligaments in the shoulder because of the sudden jerk that invariably occurs just before the ball is bowled.
Nevertheless, it is possible for fast bowlers to follow various workout regimes suited especially for them.See also: Test cricket bowling records , One Day International cricket bowling records and Twenty20 International cricket bowling recordsThis section does not cite any references or sources .

born 2 September 1988) is an Indian cricketer who has represented India in Tests, ODIs and T20Is.
He is a 1.93 m  tall At the age of 18, Sharma was called to join the Indian squad for the tour of South Africa in 2006–07 .
However, after receiving the call and organising travel arrangements, it was decided not to send him on the tour.
While being a "rhythm" bowler, he still is considered one of the fastest Indian bowlers having bowled in excess of 150 km/h on several occasions in international cricket as well as the IPL, his fastest being 152 km/h.Ishant plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and has taken 68 wickets in 14  first-class games, Ishant toured England with the India Under-19s in 2006 and Pakistan in 2006–07.
He played three youth tests and six youth One Day Internationals for India.
On the basis of his strong performance in Australia in 2008, Ishant Sharma was bought for a winning bid of $950,000 by Kolkata Knight Riders in the player auction for the Indian Premier League .
This was the highest amount paid for any bowler in tournament.In May 2007, Sharma was selected in the test team for the Bangladesh tour and played as a replacement for the fast bowler Munaf Patel .
Over there he played for his national side in the second test where he bowled three overs including one maiden and conceded only five runs without taking a wicket.
Later on, he was called for the tour of England in July–August 2007.Sharma got a call back in the team in the 3rd Test during Pakistan's tour of India in December 2007 due to injury of India's frontline pacers Zaheer Khan , RP Singh , and Sreesanth .
This performance earned him a place in India's squad for the tour of Australia.Sharma was left out in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne during the Border–Gavaskar Trophy as India retained their main fast bowlers, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh.
However, in January 2008 Sharma was called to represent India once again to replace the injured Zaheer Khan in the second test at the SCG .
Sharma started the first day of the match strongly and was involved in a controversial decision from Steve Bucknor when Andrew Symonds nicked the ball to keeper MS Dhoni off his bowling but was given not out.
He bowled reasonably in the match, however without much luck.Although he had little success, the management retained him for the third Test match at Perth.
On the fourth day of the match he bowled an exceptional spell to Australian captain Ricky Ponting that resulted in his wicket and helped India claim victory.
On 10 February 2008, Sharma bagged four important wickets in the 4th ODI of CB Series against Australia.
He ended the match with figures of 4/38 and named Man of the Match.
During the 2008 Test series against Australia in India , Ishant was the leading wicket-taker, with 16, and was named man-of-the-series as India won 2–0.
He thereby became the first Indian paceman to win such an award in a Test series on Indian soil after Kapil Dev who won the award in 1983.
He was noted for achieving reverse swing on balls sometimes as young as eight overs, and along with senior opening bowler Zaheer Khan, troubled the touring Australians.
However, in 2009, Ishant's form slumped, and he was dropped for the second Test against Sri Lanka, replaced by Sreesanth .On 5 October 2010, Ishant helped VVS Laxman pull off a highly unlikely win over Australia by one wicket in the first Test in Mohali after India had fallen to 8/124 in pursuit of 205.
Ishant provided Laxman with support during an 81-run partnership in which he contributed 31 valuable runs.In the 2011 IPL auction, Sharma was bought by the Deccan Chargers ; he hoped that his performance in the competition would give him a chance to impress selectors and push for selection in India's ODI team.
After the tour of West Indies, India suffer a run of eight consecutive defeats in away Tests.
In July and August the team played four Tests in England .
England inflicted a 4–0 whitewash on India, In March 2012, Sharma underwent surgery on his ankle which had been troubling him for over a year.
The operation meant that he missed the 2012 IPL.
In 2013 Ind vs Aus ODI series, he gave away 30 runs in an over, equalling the most expensive over by an Indian bowler.
After some bad performances against Australia in 2013 ODI series, he came back strongly against South Africa taking 4/40 in the third ODI on 11 December 2013 at SuperSport Park , which was his 2nd best performance in ODIs.
In the 2014 tour of England , Sharma secured his career best figures of 7/74 at the Lord's , with an aggressive spell in England's second innings, bowling India to a 95-run win.
India won the series 2–1.A right arm fast-medium bowler, the speed of Sharma's bowling has diminished since he emerged on the international scene, Simons noted height was a factor in the length Sharma bowled, saying "For Ishant to hit the stumps, he has to pitch it fuller, and that means the batsman has more chance of keeping it out".

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .The IPL is no stranger to controversy, but on May 16, 2013 it met arguably its biggest crisis when Delhi Police arrested three Rajasthan Royals players – Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan – soon after their match in Mumbai for spot-fixing.
Eleven bookies were also arrested at that time, including one – Amit Singh – who was a former Royals player.
Royals later suspended their players and the BCCI set up an inquiry, headed by its ACSU chief Ravi Sawani, into the allegations.
The board also announced enhanced anti-corruption measures, including two more security personnel with each team.
The arrests kicked off a nationwide search and arrest of bookmakers – betting is illegal in India.
One of those picked up in Mumbai was a small-time actor, Virender "Vindoo" Dara Singh, arrested on charges of links with bookmakers.
His testimony led the police to arrest, on May 24, 2013, Gurunath Meiyappan , a top official of Chennai Super Kings and son-in-law of BCCI president N Srinivasan.
Delhi Police eventually chargesheeted the players, among 39 persons, under sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, while the BCCI handed out life bans to Sreesanth and Chavan after Sawani's probe found them guilty of fixing.
On July 14, 2015, a three-member panel—appointed by the Indian Supreme Court , and headed by former Chief Justice RM Lodha —suspended Chennai Super Kings and the Rajasthan Royals for two years.
It also banned two club owners, Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra, for life, due to their involvement in betting.
These judgements can be considered as the aftermath of previous years' spot-fixing issues.

After the incumbent all rounder Yusuf Pathan suffered a loss of form, Jadeja took his place at No. 7 in the ODI team in late-2009.
In the third ODI against Sri Lanka in Cuttack on 21 December 2009, Jadeja was awarded the man of the match award following a haul of four wickets.
His best bowling is 4–32.
He made a comeback into the Indian ODI side in the third ODI against England at The Oval in London.
Arriving at the crease with India 58–5 after 19 overs, he scored 78, adding 112 with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni and 59 off only 5.1 overs with Ravichandran Ashwin to help his side reach 234–7 in 50 overs.
He also took 2–42 from his 9 overs and was named "player of the match", but England won the rain-affected game.
His performance in the fourth ODI at Lord's was mixed: he gave away four crucial overthrows with a poor throw from the boundary, but then took a brilliant catch on the boundary off the last ball.
In the second T20I of the Australian tour in February 2012, Jadeja had figures of 1/16 in 3 overs and effected two run outs in the Australian innings.
India went on to win the game and Jadeja was awarded Man of the Match, mainly for his fielding efforts.
After his impressive performance at the start of Ranji Trophy season 2012–13 in which he scored two 300+ scores in 4 matches , he was called up to join the 15-member India Test team to play the fourth Test against England at Nagpur .
During the second ODI in the India-England series at Kochi, Jadeja smashed 61 off just 37 balls which took India to a total of 285.
In the second innings he bowled a remarkable spell of 2 for 12 in 7 overs helping India beat England by 127 runs and level the series 1–1.
This performance earned Jadeja the Man of the Match award.In the historic 4–0 home Test series win against Australia in February–March 2013, Jadeja took 24 wickets, dismissing the Australian captain Michael Clarke five out of six times in the series which cemented his place in the team as an all-rounder despite not contributing much with the bat.
His seven-wicket haul including a five-for in the second innings of the final Test match earned him the Man of the Match award.
He played an important role for India in lifting the ICC Champions Trophy 2013.He made 33* with bat and took 2 wickets in the final against England.He is ranked as the No.1 bowler in ODI Cricket by the ICC in August 2013.
Jadeja is the first India bowler to top the rankings since Anil Kumble, who topped the table in 1996.
He is the fourth India bowler after Kapil Dev, Maninder Singh and Kumble to be ranked No. 1. Jadeja scored his maiden test fifty on 20 July 2014 playing against England saving the match for India who were struggling at 235/7.
He made 68 runs from just 57 balls.
His parternership of 99 with Bhuvneshwar Kumar helped India set England a target of 319.Ravindra Jadeja was selected by the Rajasthan Royals for the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League .
Jadeja scored 135 runs from 14 matches at a strike rate of 131.06, his best score being 36* against Kings XI Punjab .
He did even better in 2009 , scoring 295 runs at a strike rate of 110.90, Jadeja sat out the 2010 IPL because of a ban arising from contractual irregularities.
Ravindra Jadeja playing for Chennai Super king had fine spin bowling performance in Chennai for an IPL 2015 Match on Mother's Day; He took four wickets for 11 runs with a brilliant spell of spin attack against Rajasthan Royals.Sunil Gavaskar said in March 2013 that Ravindra Jadeja, along with Cheteshwar Pujara , was a role model for youngsters.
Online sarcasm and jokesSince his performance at the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 event, Jadeja has been a consistent target of sarcasm and jokes by cricket portals and Indian cricket fans.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter CommentThe outgoing India bowling coach talks about the development of Ishant Sharma and Sreesanth, Umesh Yadav's future and the highlights of his stintEric Simons is approaching the end of his term as bowling coach of India.
It hurts him that early reports suggested he was sacked, or, to use popular parlance, "the first casualty of the two whitewashes".
Had the results of his work as bowling coach been more conspicuous, he may not have minded such suggestions as much.
There are contrasting views on Simons.
The players all praise him, which is why his contract was extended in the first place.
Outsiders look at the likes of Ishant Sharma and Sreesanth , and conclude that their apparent lack of progress is Simons' failure.In what was, in all likelihood, Simons' final press conference as India bowling coach, he spoke at length about various issues and bowlers.
He disagrees with the notion that Ishant does not know how to take wickets.
He insists Ishant has worked on his game, bowling six to 18 inches fuller on the Australia tour than he previously did, and that he has been unlucky.He says Sreesanth is one of the most skilled bowlers he has worked with, but the fact that he could not inculcate consistency in him was something that disappointed him.
Contributing to the World Cup win is a cherished achievement, as is helping Ishant regain his pace.
Here are some excerpts from the press conference.I don't want it to sound like a cliché, but it has been an incredible experience for me.
I hoped to come along and teach some cricketers some things, to share some input, but I think one of the incredible things was that it was a learning experience for me, not only as a cricketer but as a person.Is Ishant unlucky or does he not know how to take wickets?It's a funny one.
In one of the first series  versus South Africa, in the Test we won in Kolkata, he bowled brilliantly but didn't get the rewards he deserved.
You could see his frustration.
To me, he is one of the unluckiest bowlers in the sense that for how well he bowls, and the number of wicket-taking balls he bowls, he just doesn't seem to pick up the wickets I believe - and everyone else believes - he deserves.We know that the Australians were pleased he wasn't involved in the one-day series.
He bowled so well ; he also bowls really well but doesn't pick up the number of wickets we expect him to.
For Ishant to hit the stumps, he has to pitch it fuller, and that means the batsman has more chance of keeping it out.
He has to find the right mix of deliveries to bowl.Can one be unlucky for so long?In the past, maybe you could make the point that he was not really that unlucky; but in the series against Australia, the nick that went between Laxman and Dhoni, the balls that looped and dropped safe, ones that hit the splice and did not go to hand, they were really down to poor luck.
I really think in this series Ishant kicked on a long way in terms of the number of wicket-taking deliveries he bowled.
I really do believe he was unlucky.
I hope he is not discouraged.
I hope Indian cricket sticks with him.
They have got an incredible cricketer in him.It's believed that if he can pitch the ball a couple of feet fuller, he will create nicks and not just go past the bat …We found that his length in Australia was a good six to 18 inches fuller than what used to be his regular length.
We worked on getting his length right.
It is not always that easy, you know.
I think the movement he is now getting, both away from the batsman and back in, is going to make a difference.He wants to play one-day cricket.
Should he?When I arrived, opinion was that focusing on Tests would be best for his development, and I think he was happy with that.
At that stage that was probably the right decision.
Personally, I believe he is ready for one-day cricket now.
I think he is bowling exceptionally well.
It is all about control and confidence.
But I am not part of the selection process.
You are at the nets, you know the guy, you know he is ready and when to let him go, and when not to.
Maybe being conservative with Ishant is the way the selectors want to go.
I think he is ready, but that's the selectors' decision.
I'll live with that.You were so impressed with Munaf Patel.
Why wasn't he given a chance in the Tests in England.
He even lost out to an out-of-shape RP SinghWhen RP Singh came back into the side, the point I made was that, because we didn't have anyone who could bowl at 145kph, we had to be innovative and clever in the way we put our attack together.
The thinking was that if you lost someone like Zak , you wanted someone a little bit different.
That counted in someone like RP's favour.If you have bowlers who are all similar then the batsman never has to change his angle or think differently.
It was a pity Munaf didn't play because he played a major role in the World Cup success.
It's not always what he has done in terms of wickets, but what he allows the other players to do.Eric Simons will not continue as India's bowling coach after his contract expires at the end of the tour of Australia © Getty ImagesWhat do you make of Sreesanth's progress?One of the best things about being involved with Indian cricket is the high skill-level of the players.
I have not met someone with the skill of Sreesanth.
He bowled a spell to the Australians in Bangalore, when the ball was reversing, and I said to him: "there are maybe one or two bowlers in the world that can do that."
His skills are phenomenal.Unfortunately the way the batsmen are today, the way the game has evolved, you need a lot more than that.
You need consistency.
That's something I have tried to impart.
There is no point in bowling three or four good balls in an over, and then letting the batsmen off the hook.
That's the evolution of a bowler, to stop doing that.
You watch Ben Hilfenhaus.
His plan was very simple and was very successful too.
Sometimes having a very simple gameplan that you can execute really well is better than having too many options.But one of the biggest criticisms of you is that Sreesanth and Ishant haven't evolved …Cricket is a package.
Sometimes great cricketers are not the ones with tremendous skills, but those with a great work ethic.
For a guy like Sree, I am disappointed.I disagree about Ishant, though.
The criticism I got was that he was bowling 130-132kph.
We needed the pace back.
In this series against Australia he was bowling at 140-plus again.
Our attack was probably quicker than the Australian attack, which is quite unusual for an Indian attack.
We have got back the pace, I think it's now about developing the tactical perspective.I watch Umesh with great excitement.
I started working with him two years ago, at the Delhi Daredevils.
So often on television people say his wrist is collapsing.
To me that's commentary.
How you fix it is coaching.
He was given drills two years ago, and he has performed them diligently.He is now bowling this beautiful away swing at 145kph-plus, he is an incredible athlete, and he has got incredible stamina and strength.
I think he is one of those bowlers who, when he bowls 145kph, makes the batsmen feel like it is 150 because he is so relaxed in his run-up and has such a rhythmical action.
I just think, as he grows and understands his craft better, he is going to get better.
He is one of the most exciting bowlers in the world today, not just in India.Have you warned him of case studies of young Indian bowlers before him who have lost pace?I talk to him about what I believe he has got to do.
I don't know what happened with other young bowlers.
Each one is going to have different stories about what happened and what didn't happen.How has it been working with Zaheer, who has been in and out of the side?One of the things that is very encouraging is how fit Zaheer is looking at the moment and how excited he is about playing cricket again.
He is a player with great skill, and I think he has a big role to play in mentoring the cricketers and bowlers around him because he has a very good understanding of his craft, and he has the ability to teach that.
He is working hard physically to make sure he is available as much as he possibly can be, and I think that's where the key lies.What about the spinners?R Ashwin has been bowling really well.
He has grown a lot as a bowler. .
We weren't able to pick two spinners.What is your biggest achievement as India's bowling coach?It's sometimes difficult to measure progress from the outside, but I see the growth of some of the cricketers.
Sometimes when you are in the nets, you just know that the guy with you is not ready and needs help; a journalist sitting on the side may not see it, but you see it in the player's eyes, in his confidence.
I've helped people like that; people like R Vinay Kumar, even Praveen Kumar, who was obviously a more established cricketer, but grew as well.
Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav are players I am very excited about.It's more about individuals growing as cricketers and people.
I think from that perspective I'll walk away feeling that I've made some contribution, and take some pleasure and enjoyment out of that.
Then there's the World Cup of course.What are your future plans?I've been appointed head coach of the Delhi Daredevils, so that'll be my next assignment in the cricketing world.
I've got business in Cape Town, and that's where I go back after the IPL.
A few people have spoken to me, but I haven't made a decision yet.@
Raj Krish M, 100% agreed.
If a coach talks about "luck" something fundamentally wrong there.
People with 'will to excel' never talk about luck.
Ishant does not swing.
Does not change his length per batsman.
And he did NOT pitch up to the bat.
How else one would take wickets.
In that sense, I would rate Sreesanth as more intelligent and better learner of the game.
In the whole article Eric never talked about "brains" for the bowler.
Aus/SA bowlers know seem to KNOW where to pitch the ball for EACH batsman, which Indian pace bowlers except Zaheer dont seem to know.
A lot has to go with the coach's & bowlers HOMEWORK and practice.
Venkatesh Prasad, as coach declared already that Ind bowlers are not practicing enough.spinkingKK on February 20, 2012, 11:19 GMTIshant bowled really well in Australia.
I agree.
India should persist with him.
I would like to see him and Umesh Yadav taking up the new ball.Sports4Youth on February 20, 2012,  9:51 GMTYeah.
Why only Ishant ?
All the Indian bowlers are unlucky to have Eric Simons as their coach.Malti65 on February 20, 2012,  7:44 GMTNow Ponting has been dropped from the ODI.
Their selectors dont care if Ponting has been unlcucky or what.
Just five scores in single digits and thats it.
I think instead of spending money on foreing coaches we should hire Australian Selectors and i am sure the discussion of Ishant's luck will come to an end with a swift axe.
Also it will solve the problem of some of the seniors in the Test Squad.AbdullahShaikh on February 19, 2012, 13:28 GMTAre you joking.
Stop kidding us Simmons.
No one can remain unlucky for so long.
Even if it was true, then what is the point in having him in the team?
We should stop looking for talent and start looking for some lucky guys.
I am sure there will be many in India.Malti65 on February 19, 2012, 12:01 GMTHaving read all the views in this blog site, I am convinced that almost 99% people think that Ishant is bad and does not deserve to be in the team.
Then shouldn't the selectors know that also.
If not, then can someone please tell the selectors that there is no harm in trying some other youngsters.
After all Ishant has not performed at all.
So atleast there should be no fear of missing him if something goes wrong.
However, i am sure nothing will go wrong if Ishant is replaced by some other player.
Things can only get better.Sports4Youth on February 19, 2012, 11:56 GMTPersisting with Ishant for too long not good for Indian Team.
Remember very soon we will also be on our path of rebuilding our Batting line up, as a few old ones will have to go someday.
And as far as Test cricket is concerened We have quite a few and they are very old.
In this melieu we dont want to realise that Ishant also needs to be replaceed.
We Would be better off doing it now, otherwise we will be stuck like Pakistan, looking for too many replacements in all the deciplines of the game is not good.
As far as Ishant quality is concerned, if he is really good let him get some wickets in the domestic competition, then he can be reassesed.Sports4Youth on February 19, 2012,  7:45 GMTThere will always be a group of people who will love Ishant Sharma.
THE OPPOSITION.
Yes the opposition team would love to see Ishant in the Indian team.
because that way they get a lot of easy runs.on
February 19, 2012,  7:41 GMTThis is hilarious; why don't we simply get Ishant Sharma is not good enough for competitive int'l cricket!?Al_Bundy1 on February 18, 2012, 18:49 GMTAgree with @Umair Saleem...He is very lucky to be in indian team, reality is he is an average domestic bowler.
We have better young bowlers in Ashok Dinda, Abu Nechim Ahmed, Shami Ahmed, TP Sudhindra, etc.  Please give them a fair chance instead of Sharma or Mithun.
If even one of them clicks...he, along with Yadav, can form a potent fast bowling pair.
Zaheer will be around for a couple of years to lead/mentor them.
Irfan Pathan, Sreesanth, PK or Vinay can provide support as third seamer.TRAM on February 20, 2012, 20:25 GMT@ Raj Krish M, 100% agreed.

on February 18, 2012, 16:51 GMTIshant and Rohit will remain unlucky throughout their life - because they don't have the necessary skills !!!
Both are a burden to the teamSports4Youth on February 18, 2012, 15:08 GMT@ rahulcricket007 on  :- FULLY AGREED WITH YOU.
Even i don't think that Ishant has learnt anything.
Once Shane Warne said about Monty Panesar that he has not played 26 test matches, but played the same match 26 times.
The same is true about Ishant Sharma.
He is still at the same level.AvidCricFan on February 18, 2012, 14:03 GMTIshant is ineffective simply because he lacks variety to foxhole the batmen facing him.
Fast bowler needs to learn use of crease to create proper angles, speed variation, yorkers, subtle variation in length, and swings.
Just bowling at pace with monotony will not make him effective, specially when varying length only ends up giving boundry balls to batsmen.rahulcricket007 on February 18, 2012, 11:48 GMTSports4Youth on February 18, 2012,  9:58 GMT@  Mushtaq Hussein on  :- Sorry Can't agree with you.
Waqar was the coach of Umar Gul and Wahab Riaz.
What did he do.
A coach cannot make a pony into a colt.
Nothing can be done about Ishant.
let him go back to domestic level work hard and try to rise up the ranks.
No more freebies.hhillbumper
on February 18, 2012,  9:47 GMTInstead of blaming the coaches does a player not have some responsibility.It can't be that hard to work out to pitch it up a bit and bowl consistently.
He is not unlucky he is just average and will not improve until he accepts the fact that sometimes you actually need to work at your craft.But why bother when you can earn millions and live off a once gained reputation.Sort of sums up why Indian cricket is in a mess.No reality checks take place and it is because your team is unlucky.8
time out of 8 in foreign climes.RRnair12 on February 18, 2012,  9:40 GMTHow can everyone complain about dhoni only about the debacles in australia and england,the truth is plain and simple we dont have a quality bowling attack to pressurise quality batsmen consistently and in the field we were atrocious.What difference did sehwag make when he was captain in the final test.Unless the team and the board takes up collective responsibility for the defeat and implement corrective measures we are royally screwed.And comming to Ishant he isn't unlucky he is not good enough , luck can affect you over 10-15 test matches but never over 490 matches and unless he doesnt improve his length he will continue to be unlucky.on
February 18, 2012,  9:29 GMTWhere were the 'cutting-the-batsman-in-half' offcutters he bowled at the start of his career against Ponting and Symonds?
That, sir was the real secret of his success....
The line and lenght are just the normal stuff .
Players should understand that coaches can only do that much.
It is the player who needs to understand his core competitive edge and not loose it.
For example, do you think Kumble would have reduced pace and flighted more because of any coach's advice or injury?
Never.Vpx23 on February 18, 2012,  9:24 GMTon February 18, 2012,  9:13 GMTwhy people r going only after stats ?? and not the pressure he put on opposition for which the wickets fell on the other end to yadav and zaheer ??and dhoni was always keeping defensive fields wht can we expect then ?? u need 20 wickets then u need to keep an attacking field not an defensive oneand ishant always bowled in correct areas .i
guess people here dint watch the tests and only commenting by seeing the scorecard !!ishant shd be persisted with and we need some one who can teach ishant to bowl fuller rather than a gud length ball .hope the new bowling coach would do some wondersand ppl are saying praveen in tests ?? oh god dont joke we saw england tests where munaf was kicked on to the boundary line .u
wont take a bowler who bowls 120's we need a minimum of 135kph to be atleast decent to trounle the batsmandinda,aaron,umesh yadav and ishant and zahher along with irfan can form an formidable pace attack hope r.p singh and sreesanth get back their rhythm backMalti65 on February 18, 2012,  9:09 GMTI think Ishant Sharma is the luckiest person in the World.
All other cricketers have to spend a lot of time, efforts and money in cricket before they can progress to the next level.
But look at Ishant.
Now more than 4 years the Indian Cricket Board is spending on his Cricketing education, training equipments etc. and also it appears that coaches are being made to work hard for him.
First of all how did he get into the team.
don't we have thousands of youngsters like him playing in the domestic level and being thrown out even from there.
But Look at Ishant every body is spending so much resources on him, trying to convert him into a bowler.
HHMMM.
GREAT LUCK !!! MUST TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF HORROSCOPE HE HAS.
ANY GIRL WHO MARRIES HIM WILL BE LUCKY.on
February 18, 2012,  8:53 GMTI always believed that Ishanth can not take wikets.
Like Agarkar, Indian team is carrying Ishanth for long without any good reason....Agarkar used to take wickets but was ridiculously expensive and biggest match loser for india....rockyyy on February 18, 2012,  8:49 GMTishant go and get married!!!! u wil become alright!!!!neerajprasher on February 18, 2012,  8:39 GMTi am not  a great fan of eric simons but he did good job.why
BCCI picked that queensland bowling coach.What he is gonna do.no one heard of him before.bcci
should stick with Eric.but no  gus luck you did really well at least we won the world cup.on

on February 18, 2012,  6:23 GMTno...dont agree...at all..after...40 odd...test matches...u cannot blame ur luck...for not picking up wickets...less than 3 wickets per match....and ur...not even a exceptionally ...economical bowler...it just comes down to the fact ...that...ur just an average ...bowler ...and u havent evolved into ....a smarter bowler.with
time...u dont ..deserve to ..get more chances...go ... back to the drawing board..play a full county season....then ..we will have a look again....till ...then ...u have run out of favour ...on February 18, 2012,  4:58 GMTLuck lady is not smiling at Simons.Chetan007 on February 18, 2012,  3:42 GMTI would find more exciting if Shaun Pollock has been made the Indian bowling coach.
He has the ability to turn things out for Indian bowlers.
I find Joe exciting too but no Indian bowler will work that hard as he think they will.
We will sure going to here some controversy will the new coach.
BCCI must provide him something in selecting the bowlers needed to be played in the match instead of captain out of the bowlers selector selected for the series.
I would also prefer to have a head coach like S. Fleming or S. Waugh.
Both will benefit more to Indian cricket than the current coach.
I would like to use the service of Wasim Akram in the domestic setup to help Indian bowlers.
I want Praveen to get some tips from him as after injury he is out of touch and Wasim will help him getting back his swing.Gizza on February 18, 2012,  3:28 GMTThe thing is when Ishant bowls it looks like he is bowling well.
He has a decent line which goes in towards the right-handed batsman and it occasionally straightens.
And batsmen keep on missing.
But the length is not good enough.
Always just a little bit too short.
So his balls NEVER get the edge.
And nobdy can ball like that forever so eventually he bowls a wide ball which gets smacked for four and the batsman is still there.
At the moment it seems Zaheer Khan, Praveen Kumar and Yadav are the three best pacers in India at the moment.
If these three bowled together in England and Australia the result would have been tighter but still nowhere near enough to win.on February 18, 2012,  2:24 GMTI dont understand how Dhoni gets the sole credit of a success or a failure..in this case selection failure in the two test series.. Agreed Dhoni wasn't upto the mark with the team..but what were the support staff there for??
If a captain is unable to get his team right..the coach and others and the seniors in the team must help...whats the point in having a huge 'support' staff if they dont know how to help a captain in crisis..??okadba on February 18, 2012,  2:24 GMTIMHO, Ishant if he was part of a better disciplined bowling unit and supported with better fielding and placement would have done times better.
The defensive tactics and the nature of our grand players who can barely dive properly makes a big difference.
I believe none of Aussies bowlers individually would have done the same damage from the Indian side.
He did his best and one of the top draw bowlers for India .
The best fielders change bad luck to awesome bowling.
Look at how different the ODI fielding is with all the youngsters.
Sadly we have to hide almost 7-8 people in our test team, whereas the aussies barely have to hide 1-3 people.
For me that and the discipline in bowling is the difference.
And I believe Ponting scores indicate Indias weakness than his greatness.on
February 18, 2012,  1:52 GMTengland and australia loss are mainly due to the poor tactics of dhoni!!!!! selection howler from the captain!!!!! if a batsmen or a bopw;ler is failing he shud be bold enough to drop them or give a bowlewr an attacking field and give theam a confidence!!!!!!tats wat ganguly done!!!!! most of them said dravid and kumble were defensively as a captain,but they are better than dhoni!!! they dont loose like dhoni loose!!!RK.Chandru on February 18, 2012,  1:41 GMTI'd say, Ishant is in fact lucky to have played these many matches for India without showing any exceptional talent.
Even my detractors would agree that, a reasonable bowler  strike rate even in first class matches.
We're only wasting precious time and match experience for deserving bowlers like Dinda / Varun trying this man again and again.
If height is the criteria that's getting him selection, you can find many taller than him and if u teach them the art of fast bowling, they'll sure become a lot better.
Do not invest any more hopes on Ishant and let hime earn selection by working hard and doing exceptionally at the domestic level.Vinnyvinner on February 18, 2012,  1:12 GMTI'm not really sure about the other series but definitely Ishant was unlucky in the Australian summer and testimony to that all Australian commentators repeating their statement for the whole series.
But there is no second thought that Ishant needs to improve his wicket taking ability which makes a complete bowler.CricketFanInLosAngles on February 18, 2012,  0:58 GMTIshant is NOT unlucky.
He has NOT learnt how to bowl line and length.
He is is bowling with out using his brains.
I expected him to learn.
He has potential.
Just does not use his brains and line and length.here2rock
on February 17, 2012, 23:52 GMTLooking at the progress of Indian bowlers you have to say that either they are slow/no learners or they have a bad coach.
There is only so much a coach can do but I don't think the Indian bowlers have developed at all over the last few years.
Ishant Sharma has taken huge steps backward.
Indian selectors have invested in havily but he has not repaid them back their faith.inswing
on February 17, 2012, 22:47 GMTYou can be unlucky for one innings, two, three, four innings.
You cannot be unlucky for 40 out of 45 tests you have played.
Simmons needs to go, and Ishant needs to be dropped to work out his game domestically.on
February 17, 2012, 22:18 GMTSurprising comments from bowling coach.. Ishanth only has only one delivery that comes into Right hand batsman and doesn't have any variations like slower ball.. Its a pity that he si still supporting Ishanth... Whena bowler plays 50 test matches without learning anything then He is fit for nothing.. Give hima break untill he grinds it out on Indian pitches in Ranji seasons..Its smiple.. pick him up when the takes wickets consistently.. hope someone listensCricFan78 on February 17, 2012, 21:50 GMTDont know why people are digging into Ishant and Eric.
Ponting, Clarke etc. said same thing during Test series that Ishant have bowled excellently but has no rewards to show.Sports4Youth on February 17, 2012, 21:30 GMT@  rahulcricket007 on  :- THAT RIGHT MAN.
This is India.
With such stats any bowker in the world would be first thrown out, then loose central contracts.
But in India we find novel ways of honoring failures and paying underperforming bowlers.
I am just getting sick & tired of all this nonsense.Sports4Youth on February 17, 2012, 21:24 GMT@  Max Eddy on  :-- I like the sarcasm.
good pun.
But come-on, we also have Zaheer, Praveen, Umesh & Ashwin.
Aren't they good enough.Sports4Youth on February 17, 2012, 21:18 GMTIshant's Stats : --> http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/236779.html  . .
Compare these stats to any bowler in the world.
Nowhere in the world will you find such stats being honoured.
At 45 tests he is more experienced than Sreesant.
But his bowling average is nearing 38 in tests.
In any other county he would have been thrown out long back.Sports4Youth on February 17, 2012, 21:13 GMT@ S.Jagernath on  :- You are spot on man.
I have been getting sick of this comment about luck since a long time.
Am glad to see from the various comments that same is the case of many other fans.
Ishant was a bad investment.
We should learn to move on.
That is the way forward.
We dont want to end up blocking out more worthy youngters for a failed case.Sports4Youth on February 17, 2012, 21:10 GMT@  zico123 & Luqman Amin & torsha & x-squire-x & Raj Krish M & Umair Saleem & Umair Saleem .
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH ALL YOU GENTLEMEN.
A few decades back we had a very hyped tall fast bowler named T.A.Shekhar.
In the end turned out to be nothing.
I don't understand how long can Ishant play just on the reputaion of one series 3 years ago.
Young praveen is far more skillful.
Also i believe Yadav is very promising.
Also Varun Aaron is round the corner.
We will find even more, after all India is such a vast country.
Just the selectors and coaches have to work a little harder.
After all this country produced Kapil Dev, Javagal Sreenanth & Venkatesh Prasad and finally Zaheer Khan when no professional guidance was available.
We have such diamonds scattered all over the country, just some one has to mine them out into the international scene.Mr_Anonymous on February 17, 2012, 21:03 GMTI am sorry Mr. Simons but I am appalled at your "excuses" and am glad that you chose to exit the bowling coach responsibility as it was clearly not working.I think you had a splendid opportunity to seal the post with the overseas tours of WI, England and Australia but you didn't.
I am not saying that we did poorly on these tours because of bowling only  but the fact that there was a bowling failure should be attributed to you.Look at England's bowling in the recently concluded series against Pakistan.
Yes, they lost 3-0 but their bowling was still very good.
I wish we could have said the same for the Indian bowling in the 3 overseas series.
Those were really the series where we needed your help the most and you did not deliver.At this point, I think we needed to give a chance to someone new and I hope that Joe Dawes does well.
Umesh, Vinay, Pathan, Munaf, Sreesanth, RP Singh, Rituraj Singh, Dinda have potential and need help to develop it properly.Sports4Youth on February 17, 2012, 20:56 GMT@ andylaksh1 on  :-- You have absolutely nailed it man.
I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY.
Regarding dropped catches and missing by whiskers this happens to all the bowlers all the time.
Infact he should ask the Pakistani bowlers who have the worst fielders in the world.
Even their regular wicket keepers like Moin & Kamran would regularly drop catches.
Inspite of such a desparately horrible situations they move on and produce better results with the ball.on
February 17, 2012, 20:56 GMTTo me 'Jason Gillespie' was very unlucky too.
He bowled beautifully in India but was not rewarded.
He had a nice rhythm and pace.
Unfortunately, he was in the era of McGrath and did not shine much.Rahulbose on February 17, 2012, 20:52 GMTSharma is not unlucky, he has just stagnated and not improved as a bowler.
You can hardly blame Simmons for supporting Ishant.
But another way to look at it is that India don't have too many other options, so they should stick with Ishant and keep giving him chances.
One thing they could do is pull him from IPL and other T20 leagues and get him to play more first class matches or maybe one full county season.
That worked wonders with Zaheer, maybe Ishant will be the same.S.Jagernath on February 17, 2012, 19:59 GMTIshant Sharma has been on every tour & got demolished in all but the West Indian tour.His action is sickening & his attitude of winning only in India matches with it.He does nothing but break the pressure built,on extreme green tops in South Africa,he was pathetic.In beautiful swing & seam bowling conditions in England he was just as poor but in Australia he took pathetic to a new level.Umesh Yadav,though expensive,needs to work on his bowling technique & deserves more oppurtunities.County cricket for promising Indian talent would be very good.Varun Aaron needs to work on his accuracy,Praveen Kumar is very skillful & Zaheer Khan is just brilliant.With young talents like Dhawal Kulkarni & Rituraj Singh,I can't understand how Sharma is still around.Ishant Sharma & Suresh Raina are a lot alike.Both are not good enough to be in a team desiring the #1 spot in ODIs & Test cricket but are selected over players  that are working hard & performing exceptionally well.SantoshGhirnikar on February 17, 2012, 19:41 GMTMcGrath did not have express pace.
At 130 kmph he had batsmen fearing him.
Ishant can be a McGrath if he works hard on emulating McGrath's strength such as accuracy, unwavering line and length and fire in the belly.
Sadly, India will overbowl and overhype Yadav and soon he will fade into oblivion like so many before him.on
February 17, 2012, 19:33 GMTI didn't realise India had a bowling coach.cricmatters on February 17, 2012, 18:14 GMTIshant Sharma is a one trick pony who can't bowl fuller lengths required to get wickets on bouncy surfaces.
He really bowled well in the previous tour but this time he was bowling short again.
India needed a bowling coach who could make them bowl line and lenth and stick to basics.
If Indian bowlers needed any guidance, all they had to do is to look at their opposite numbers who won the Test series with some disciplined bowling with relentless accuracy.on
February 17, 2012, 18:00 GMTon February 17, 2012, 17:36 GMT"Ishant is unlucky".. Now this one line is enough to say "Eric Simons is unworthy".
It's sad to hear the words like 'luck' from an international coach.Sports4Youth on February 17, 2012, 17:16 GMTEric surprises me with the comment of Ishant's height and similarity with Morne.
To suggest that the height is some kind of a disadvantage to him and different lengths is out of this World.
If I am not mistaken Waseem Akram, Anderson, Umar Gul have the same height of 6'3" as Ishant.
Broad, Tremlett of Eng, are around 6'6".
Also Goel Garner, Curtly Ambros, Croft Bishop, Walsh, Mcgrath, had height more than Ishant.
Do you say that all these blokes had to contend with a big disadvantage viz height.
NO, I am sorry, height with pace was their biggest weapon.
And they knew how to hit the stumps, All of them would hit the stumps at will.
This Guy Eric expects us to accept such explanations.x-squire-x
on February 17, 2012, 17:06 GMTno such thing as luck, fortune favors the brave.. ishant has been bowling poorly, plain and simple.Sports4Youth on February 17, 2012, 17:00 GMTThis is one comment about Ishant Sharma that irritates me a lot.
Well, if he has been so unlucky for the last 3 years, what is there to suggest that he will get lucky soon?
Also don't you think that if he is so unlucky then removing him might improve India's chances with Luck?
Come-on stop kidding me.
The New boys Umesh Yadav and R.Ashwin bowled much better than him in the Aus Tests.
They gave fewer runs and took more wickets.
Ishant was the weakest link in the attack, though he was the most experienced bowler behind Zaheer.
I don't believe there is progress .
I don't think he is improving at all.
We should have tried Umesh earlier.
Also in England Praveen proved to be far better than Ishant.
Come-on This is series after series in helpful conditions for pace bowling.
PLEASE STOP THIS TORTURE OF INDIAN FANS, and move beyond Ishnat & Sreesant.
Give the younsters an opportunity.
I am sure we will find more boys like Praveen and Umesh.on
February 17, 2012, 16:56 GMTeric u did a great job mann .
hats off to u for developing ishant and umesh yadav and ur confidence on ishant .all
shd realise why did umesh get more wickets than ishant was tht ishant was putting the pressure on the other end and wickets fell on the other end for umesh and zak.i always said tht ishant is alott similar to morne morkel !! morkel too does the same in tests he puts pressure on one end and the wickets  fall on the other end for philander and steyn.like
sa kept confidence on morkel india shd keep playing ishant atleast on foreign pitches there is no use playing the medium pacers on outside pitches if they want to try praveen in tests then india is the best place for him not aus or sa .for
away tests the aquad shd comprise of umesh yadav,aaron,ishant,dinda and zaheer khan.these will wreak havoc in the opposition and this attack can be very deadlyhope irfan,r.p
singh,sreesanth get back to form then india will have a very very formidable bowling line up.andylaksh1 on February 17, 2012, 16:55 GMTIshant really is unlucky, in the sense that he wasn't blessed with a lot of SKILL.
Are you kidding me?
You take wickets with skill, not 'luck'.
If you are confident of your abilities, a ball missing the stumps by a whisker, or a close lbw turned down, or a nick that falls safe wouldn't bring you down, instead it should fire you up.
Get over all that luck cr@p, train and play with purpose, a plan, a target in mind.
You don't have to be an express tearaway all the time to take wickets.
History says so...torsha on February 17, 2012, 16:52 GMTI don't like him.
He hasn't learned from his mistakes.
When he was came before, his line and length were perfect but now he seems to have lost it.

with his height, speed, swing, if he bowls full, he will get bag full of wickets.
if he is worried about getting driven, then he should ask captain for cover and third man and 3 slips and should bowl full all day. he will then be one of the best in the world, but currently he is a very average bowler, not even good.on

He is a right-handed batsman and occasional wicket-keeper .
Rahul played for India at the 2010 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup .
He was a part of the IPL team Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2013.
In 2014, he was bought by the Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs. 1 crore at the auction.Rahul started his international career debuting against Australia in the 2014-15 Test series at Melbourne.
In his second Test match at Sydney, he scored 110, his maiden Test century.Rahul made his debut in the 2010-11 season, playing first-class cricket for Karnataka .
He made his debut in Indian Premier League in 2014, playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad .
Playing for South Zone in the final of the 2014–15 Duleep Trophy against Central Zone, Rahul scored 185 off 233 balls in the first innings and 130 off 152 balls in the second.
Although his contribution went in vain with South Zone losing the match by nine runs, his efforts earned him the man of the match award and selection to the Indian Test squad for the Australian tour in December 2014.He became the first triple-centurion for Karnataka in a first class match on 30 January 2015, playing against Uttar Pradesh and scoring 337 in M. Chinnaswamy Stadium , Bengaluru .
His knock of 337 came off 448 balls and included 47 fours and 4 sixes.He also made 188 runs in the Final and finshed the same Ranji season with an average of 93.11 in the nine matches he played.After an excellent domestic season in 2014, Rahul was picked in the Indian Test squad for the Australian tour .
He made his Test Debut in the Boxing Day Test Match beginning on 26 December 2014 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground .
He replaced Rohit Sharma and was handed over the Test cap by MS Dhoni .
He come to bat at no. 6 and made 3 runs in the first inning.
In the second inning he played at no. 3 and made only 1 run.
He retained his place for the fourth test played at Sydney Cricket Ground .
He open the inning with Murali Vijay and made 110 runs, his maiden International hundred.He was a part of 15-man squad for the tour of Bangladesh in June 2015 but later withdrew due to dengue fever.
He then made a comeback into the Test team in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour after Murali Vijay was ruled out due to a hamstring injury.
But he did not show any progress in the first match where he got out early in both innings for less than 10 runs.
In the second match of the series, Shikhar Dhawan lost his place due to injury and ruled out from the rest of the tour.
So, Rahul got a chance to show his talents once again where he made his second Test century of 108 runs from 190 balls inculding 14 fours and 1 six.
India finally went on to win the match to level the series and Rahul named as the man of the match.
His wicket keeping skills came in handy, when saha got injured, Rahul took a spectacular catch to dismiss Mathews in the second innings, who was doing well throughout the series hence his catch proved to be game changing.
Rahul originally hails from Mangalore .
Rahul's father, KN Lokesh, is a professor at the NITK .
His mother, Rajeshwari, is an associate professor at Mangalore University ’s undergraduate college.
Rahul's father, who was a big fan of Sunil Gavaskar , wanted to name him after Gavaskar's son but mistook the name of Gavaskar's son 'Rohan' as 'Rahul'.

Test cricket is played in traditional white clothes and with a red ball .Test cricket is the longest form of the sport of cricket .
Test matches are played between national representative teams with "Test status", as determined by the International Cricket Council .
The two teams of 11 players play a four-innings match, which often lasts up to five days.
It is generally considered the most complete examination of teams' playing ability and endurance.
The first officially recognised Test match began on 15 March 1877, between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , where Australia won by 45 runs.
In October 2012, the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches.
Test matches are included in first-class cricket .
Matches are played between national representative teams with "Test status", as determined by the International Cricket Council .
As of December 2014 In January 2014, during the historic ICC meeting in Dubai, the pathway for new potential test nations was laid out with the winners of the next round of the ICC Intercontinental Cup playing a 5-day match against the bottom rank test nation.
If the Associate team defeats the test nation, then they could be added as the new test country and be given full membership.A list of matches, defined as "Tests", was first drawn up by Australian Clarence Moody in the mid-1890s.
Representative matches played by simultaneous England touring sides of 1891–92  are deemed to have "Test status".In 1970, a series of five "Test matches" was played in England between England and a Rest of the World XI.
These matches, originally scheduled between England and South Africa, were amended after South Africa was suspended from international cricket because of their government's policy of apartheid .
Although initially given Test status .
Despite this, in 2005, the ICC ruled that the six-day Super Series match that took place in October 2005, between Australia and a World XI, was an official Test match.
Some cricket writers and statisticians, including Bill Frindall , ignored the ICC's ruling and excluded the 2005 match from their records.
The series of "Test matches" played in Australia between Australia and a World XI in 1971/72 do not have Test status.
The commercial " Supertests " organised by Kerry Packer as part of his World Series Cricket enterprise and played between "WSC Australia", "WSC World XI" and "WSC West Indies" from 1977 to 1979 have never been regarded as official Test matches.There are currently ten Test-playing teams, representing individual nations except for England and the West Indies .
Test status is conferred upon a country or group of countries by the International Cricket Council .
Teams that do not have Test status can play in the ICC Intercontinental Cup , specifically designed to allow non-Test teams to play under conditions similar to Tests .
The teams are listed below with the date of each team's Test debut:Did not participate in international cricket between 10 March 1970 and 10 November 1991 after the International Cricket Conference suspended South Africa in response to the South African Government's policy of apartheid .Voluntarily suspended from Test cricket between 10 June 2004 and 6 January 2005, and from 18 January 2006 until 3 August 2011In 2009, Ireland stated its intention to apply for Full Membership of the ICC with the aim of achieving Test status,  which, even if successful, would be too late for the inaugural ICC World Test Championship scheduled to take place in 2017.In 2014, the ICC announced the introduction of the ICC Test Challenge, which will see the holder of the Intercontinental Cup play a pair of two five-day match series against the lowest ranked test-playing nation every four years, starting in 2018.
The times of sessions and intervals may be altered in certain circumstances: if bad weather or a change of innings occurs close to a scheduled break, the break may be taken immediately; if there has been a loss of playing time, for example because of bad weather, the session times may be adjusted to make up the lost time; if the batting side is nine wickets down at the scheduled tea break, then the interval may be delayed until either 30 minutes has elapsed or the team is all out; In the early days of Test cricket, matches were played over three or four days.
Until the 1980s, it was usual to include a 'rest day,' often a Sunday.
There have also been ' Timeless Tests ', which did not end after a predetermined maximum time.
In 2005, Australia played a six-day match against a World XI, which the ICC sanctioned as an official Test match even though the match reached a conclusion on the fourth day.There have been attempts by the ICC, the sport's governing body, to introduce day-night Test Matches.
Further information: Cricket § Rules and game-playTest cricket is played in innings .
Ordinarily four innings are played in a Test match, and each team bats twice and bowls twice.
Before the start of play on the first day, the two team captains and the match referee toss a coin ; the captain who wins the toss decides whether his team will bat or bowl first.In the following scenarios, the team that bats first is referred to as Team A and their opponents as Team B.Usually the teams will alternate at the completion of each innings.
Thus, Team A will bat  until its innings ends, and then Team B will bat and Team A will bowl.
When Team B's innings ends, Team A begin their second innings, and this is followed by Team B's second innings.
The winning team is the one that scores more runs in their two innings.A team's innings ends in one of the following ways: The team is "all out".
This typically occurs when a team has lost ten wickets .The team's captain declares the innings closed, usually because they believe they have enough runs.
A declaration before the innings starts is called an innings forfeiture.If, at the completion of its first innings, Team B's first innings total is 200 or more fewer than Team A's, the captain of Team A may  order Team B to have their second innings next.
This is called enforcing the follow on .
If the whole of the first day's play of a test match has been lost because of bad weather, then Team A may enforce the follow on if Team B's first innings total is 150 or more fewer than Team A's.
During the 2nd test between England and New Zealand at Headingley, Leeds, 24–28 May 2013, England batted first after the first day was lost because of rain.
New Zealand, batting second, scored 180 runs fewer than England, meaning England could have enforced the follow on, though chose not to.
This is similar to four-day first class cricket, where the follow on can be enforced if the difference is 150 runs or fewer.After 80 overs, the captain of the bowling side may take a new ball , although this is not required.
The captain will usually take the new ball: being harder and smoother than an old ball, a new ball generally favours faster bowlers who can make it bounce more variably.
The roughened, softer surface of an old ball can be more conducive to spin bowlers, or those using reverse swing .
The captain may delay the decision to take the new ball if he wishes to continue with his spinners .
After a new ball has been taken, should an innings last a further 80 overs, then the captain will have the option to take another new ball.A Test match may end in one of six results :All four innings are complete.
The team batting fourth are all out before overtaking the other team, usually before matching the other team's score.
The team that batted thirdy Community College.

In West Indies domestic first-class cricket, Dominica participates as part of the Windward Islands cricket team , although they are often considered a part of the Leeward Islands geographically.
This is due to being part of the British Windward Islands colony from 1940 until independence; its cricket federation remains a part of the Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control.On 24 October 2007, the 8,000-seat Windsor cricket stadium was completed with a donation of EC$ 33 million  from the government of the People's Republic of China .During the 2014 Winter Olympics , a husband and wife team of Gary di Silvestri and Angela Morrone di Silvestri spent US$ 175,000 to register as Dominican citizens and enter the 15 km men's and 10 km women's cross-country skiing events, respectively.
Angela did not start her race, and Gary pulled out several hundred meters into his race.
To date, they are Dominica's only Winter Olympic athletes.

city of Cardiff is the county town of the historic county of Glamorgan .
Cardiff is part of the Eurocities network of the largest European cities.
The Cardiff Urban Area covers a slightly larger area outside the county boundary, and includes the towns of Dinas Powys and Penarth .
A small town until the early 19th century, its prominence as a major port for the transport of coal following the arrival of industry in the region contributed to its rise as a major city.Cardiff was made a city in 1905, and proclaimed the capital of Wales in 1955.
Since the 1990s, Cardiff has seen significant development.
A new waterfront area at Cardiff Bay contains the Senedd building, home to the Welsh Assembly and the Wales Millennium Centre arts complex.
Current developments include the continuation of the redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay and city centre areas with projects such as the Cardiff International Sports Village , a BBC drama village , Sporting venues in the city include the Millennium Stadium .
The city was awarded with the European City of Sport in 2009 due to its role in hosting major international sporting events.
Again Cardiff was the European City of Sport in 2014.

The change from -dyf to -dydd shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh f The anglicised form Cardiff is derived from Caerdyf, with the Welsh f  the final vowel has been borrowed as /ɪ/.The antiquarian William Camden , a name supposedly given in honour of Aulus Didius Gallus , governor of a nearby province at the time when the Roman fort was established.
Although some sources repeat this theory, it has been rejected on linguistic grounds by modern scholars such as Professor Gwynedd Pierce.
Archaeological evidence from sites in and around Cardiff—the St Lythans burial chamber , near Wenvoe  , during the early Neolithic; about 1,500 years before either Stonehenge or the Great Pyramid of Giza was completed.
Until the Roman conquest of Britain , Cardiff was part of the territory of the Silures – a Celtic British tribe that flourished in the Iron Age – whose territory included the areas that would become known as Breconshire , Monmouthshire and Glamorgan.
Little is known about the fort and civilian settlement in the period between the Roman departure from Britain and the Norman Conquest.
The settlement probably shrank in size and may even have been abandoned.
In the absence of Roman rule, Wales was divided into small kingdoms; early on, Meurig ap Tewdrig emerged as the local king in Glywysing .
The area passed through his family until the advent of the Normans in the 11th century.
In 1081 William I, King of England , began work on the castle keep within the walls of the old Roman fort.
The castle was substantially altered and extended during the Victorian period by John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute , and the architect William Burges .
Original Roman work can, however, still be distinguished in the wall facings.A small town grew up in the shadow of the castle, made up primarily of settlers from England.
In the early 12th century a wooden palisade was erected around the city to protect it.
Cardiff was a busy port in the Middle Ages, and was declared a Staple port in 1327.
Henry II travelled through Cardiff on his journey to Ireland and had a premonition against the holding of Sunday markets at St Piran's Chapel , which stood in the middle of the road between the castle entrance and Westgate.In 1404 Owain Glyndŵr burned Cardiff and took Cardiff Castle.
In 1536, the Act of Union between England and Wales led to the creation of the shire of Glamorgan, and Cardiff was made the county town .
It also became part of Kibbor hundred .Cardiff had become a Free Borough in 1542.
A disastrous flood of the Bristol Channel on 30 January 1607  During the Second English Civil War , St Fagans just to the west of the town, played host to the Battle of St Fagans .
The battle, between a Royalist rebellion and a New Model Army detachment, was a decisive victory for the Parliamentarians and allowed Oliver Cromwell to conquer Wales.
In the ensuing century Cardiff was at peace.
In 1766, John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute married into the Herbert family and was later created Baron Cardiff , Cardiff Docks —from where coal was shipped throughout the worldIn 1793, John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute was born.
He would spend his life building the Cardiff docks and would later be called "the creator of modern Cardiff".
After the Napoleonic Wars Cardiff entered a period of social and industrial unrest, starting with the trial and hanging of Dic Penderyn in 1831.The town grew rapidly from the 1830s onwards, when the Marquess of Bute built a dock , which eventually linked to the Taff Vale Railway .
Cardiff became the main port for exports of coal from the Cynon , Rhondda , and Rhymney valleys, and grew at a rate of nearly 80% per decade between 1840 and 1870.
Much of the growth was due to migration from within and outside Wales: in 1841, a quarter of Cardiff's population were English-born and more than 10% had been born in Ireland.
A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Maindy Barracks in 1877.
Cardiff faced a challenge in the 1880s when David Davies of Llandinam and the Barry Railway Company promoted the development of rival docks at Barry .
Barry docks had the advantage of being accessible in all tides , and David Davies claimed that his venture would cause "grass to grow in the streets of Cardiff".
From 1901 coal exports from Barry surpassed those from Cardiff, but the administration of the coal trade remained centred on Cardiff, in particular its Coal Exchange , where the price of coal on the British market was determined and the first million-pound deal was struck in 1907.
King Edward VII granted Cardiff city status on 28 October 1905, After a brief post-war boom, Cardiff docks entered a prolonged decline in the interwar period .
By 1936, their trade was less than half its value in 1913, reflecting the slump in demand for Welsh coal .
Bomb damage during the Cardiff Blitz in World War II included the devastation of Llandaff Cathedral , and in the immediate postwar years the city's link with the Bute family came to an end.National Museum of Wales, CardiffThe city was proclaimed capital city of Wales on 20 December 1955, by a written reply by the Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George .
Caernarfon had also vied for this title.
Cardiff therefore celebrated two important anniversaries in 2005.
The Encyclopedia of Wales notes that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales "had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal Conservative constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have".
Although the city hosted the Commonwealth Games in 1958, Cardiff only became a centre of national administration with the establishment of the Welsh Office in 1964, which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the Arts Council of Wales and the Welsh Development Agency , most of which were based in Cardiff.The East Moors Steelworks closed in 1978 and Cardiff lost population during the 1980s, In the 1997 devolution referendum , Cardiff voters rejected the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales by 55.4% to 44.2% on a 47% turnout, which Denis Balsom partly ascribed to a general preference in Cardiff and some other parts of Wales for a 'British' rather than exclusively 'Welsh' identity .
However, the Assembly eventually located at Tŷ Hywel in Cardiff Bay in 1999; in 2005, a new debating chamber on an adjacent site, designed by Richard Rogers , was opened.The city was county town of Glamorgan until the council reorganisation in 1974 paired Cardiff and the now Vale of Glamorgan together as the new county of South Glamorgan .
Further local government restructuring in 1996 resulted in Cardiff city's district council becoming a unitary authority , the City and County of Cardiff , with the addition of Creigiau and Pentyrch .See also: Cardiff Council and National Assembly for WalesSince local government reorganisation in 1996 , Cardiff has been governed by The City and County Council of Cardiff, which is based at County Hall in Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff Bay.
Voters elect 75 councillors every four years.Between the 2004 and 2012 local elections, no individual political party held a majority on Cardiff County Council.
The Liberal Democrats held the largest number of seats and Cllr Rodney Berman was Leader of the Council.
In the 2012 elections the Labour Party achieved an outright majority, after gaining an additional 33 seats across the city.The Senedd , seat of the Welsh Assembly, is located in Cardiff Bay .The National Assembly for Wales has been based in Cardiff Bay since its formation in 1999.
The building, known as the Senedd  to the Assembly, with the individual constituencies for the Assembly being the same as for the UK Parliament.
All of the city's residents have an extra vote for the South Wales Central region which increases proportionality to the Assembly.
The most recent Welsh Assembly general election were held on 5 May 2011 .In the Assembly Cardiff is represented by Jenny Rathbone  in Cardiff West .In Westminster, Cardiff is represented by Jo Stevens  in Cardiff West .The Welsh Government has its headquarters in Cardiff's Cathays Park where most of its civil servants are based, with smaller numbers in other locations in the city centre , Cathays , Canton , and Cardiff Bay .
For local government purposes, Cardiff is divided into communities.
Several of these have their own community council, while the rest are governed solely by Cardiff City Council.
They are:Main article: Geography of CardiffThe centre of Cardiff is relatively flat and is bounded by hills on the outskirts to the east, north and west.
Its geographic features were influential in its development as the world's largest coal port, most notably its proximity and easy access to the coal fields of the south Wales valleys.
The highest point in the authority is Garth Hill 307 metres  above sea level .Cardiff is built on reclaimed marshland on a bed of Triassic stones; this reclaimed marshland stretches from Chepstow to the Ely Estuary , Cardiff is bordered to the west by the rural district of the Vale of Glamorgan—also known as The Garden of Cardiff—  to the east by the city of Newport, to the north by the South Wales Valleys and to the south by the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel .
The River Taff winds through the centre of the city and together with the River Ely flows into the freshwater lake of Cardiff Bay.
A third river, the Rhymney flows through the east of the city entering directly into the Severn Estuary.Cardiff is situated near the Glamorgan Heritage Coast , stretching westward from Penarth and Barry— commuter towns of Cardiff—with striped yellow-blue Jurassic limestone cliffs.
The Glamorgan coast is the only part of the Celtic Sea that has exposed Jurassic  geology.
This stretch of coast, which has reefs, sandbanks and serrated cliffs, was a ship graveyard ; ships sailing up to Cardiff during the industrial era often never made it as far as Cardiff as many were wrecked around this hostile coastline during west/south-westerly gales.
Consequently, smuggling, deliberate shipwrecking and attacks on ships were common.
"Inner Cardiff" consists of the following wards: Plasnewydd , Gabalfa , Roath , Cathays , Adamsdown and Splott ward on the north and east of the city centre, and Butetown , Grangetown , Riverside and Canton to the south and west.
and Pontcanna  is a favourite for students and young professionals.
Penylan , which lies to the north east side of Roath Park, is an affluent area popular with those with older children and the retired.HMRC offices  in LlanishenTo the west lie Ely , Caerau and Fairwater which contain some of the largest housing estates in the United Kingdom.
With the exception of some of the outlying privately built estates at Michaelston Super Ely and 1930s developments near Waun-Gron Road, this is an economically disadvantaged area with high numbers of unemployed households.
Culverhouse Cross is a more affluent western area of the city.
Heath , Birchgrove , Gabalfa , Mynachdy , Llandaff North , Llandaff , Llanishen , Radyr , Whitchurch & Tongwynlais , Rhiwbina , Thornhill , Lisvane and Cyncoed lie in an arc from the north west to the north east of the centre.
In particular, Lisvane, Cyncoed, Radyr and Rhiwbina contain some of the most expensive housing in Wales.
Further to the east lie the wards of Pontprennau & Old St Mellons, Rumney, Pentwyn , Llanrumney and Trowbridge .
The latter three are again largely of public housing stock, although new private housing is being built in Trowbridge in considerable number.
Pontprennau is the newest 'suburb' of Cardiff, whilst Old St Mellons has a history going back to the Norman Conquest in the 11th century.
Since 2000, there has been a significant change of scale and building height in Cardiff, with the development of the city centre 's first purpose-built high-rise apartments.
Cardiff lies within the north temperate zone and has an essentially maritime climate , characterised by mild weather that is often cloudy, wet and windy.
Dock feeder canal in Atlantic Wharf in WinterThe northern part of the county, being higher and inland—for example, The Garth —tends to be cooler and wetter than the city centre.Cardiff's maximum and minimum monthly temperatures average 21.5 °C .Cardiff has 1518 hours of sunshine during an average year .
Rain falls in Cardiff on 146 days during an average year, with total annual rainfall of 1,111.7 millimetres .

Historical populations are calculated with the modern boundariesFollowing a period of decline during the 1970s and 1980s, Cardiff's population is growing.
The local authority area had a population of 346,100 at the 2011 census , Official estimates derived from the census regarding the city's total population have been disputed.
The city council has published two articles that argue the 2001 census seriously under reports the population of Cardiff and, in particular, the ethnic minority population of some inner city areas.
Cardiff has an ethnically diverse population due to its past trading connections, post-war immigration and the large numbers of foreign students who attend university in the city.
The ethnic make-up of Cardiff's population at the time of the 2011 census was: 84.7% White, 1.6% mixed White and Black African/Caribbean, 0.7% mixed White and Asian, 0.6% mixed other, 8% Asian, 2.4% Black, 1.4% Arab and 0.6% other ethnic groups.
Cardiff has a chequered linguistic history with Welsh , English, Latin , Norse and Norman French preponderant at different times.
Welsh was the majority language in Cardiff from the 13th century until the city's explosive growth in the Victorian era .
In addition to English and Welsh, the diversity of Cardiff's population  means that a large number of languages are spoken within the city.
One study has found that Cardiff has speakers of at least 94 languages, with Somali , Urdu , Bengali and Arabic being the most commonly spoken foreign languages.
A more mid-centralised pronunciation of ⟨ʌ⟩ as in love and other Due to its diversity, large student population, and convenient size and location, Cardiff has seen a rise in the number of people coming to the city to learn English.
Foreign students are a common sight on the streets of Cardiff with a large percentage coming from Arabic and other European countries.
Since 1922 Cardiff has included the suburban cathedral 'village' of Llandaff, whose bishop is also Archbishop of Wales since 2002.
There is also a Roman Catholic cathedral in the city.
Since 1916 Cardiff has been the seat of a Catholic archbishop, but there appears to have been a fall in the estimated Catholic population, with estimated numbers in 2006 being around 25,000 less than in 1980.
In the 2001 census 66.9% of Cardiff's population described itself as Christian, a percentage point below the Welsh and UK averages.Shri Swaminarayan Mandir was the first Hindu temple in Wales, it is also the largest in WalesThe oldest of the non-Christian communities in Wales is Judaism.
Jews were not permitted to live in Wales between the 1290 Edict of Expulsion —given by Edward I of England —and the 17th century.
A Welsh Jewish community was re-established in the 18th century.
In the 2001 census Cardiff's Muslim population stood at 3.7%, above the UK average  and significantly above the Welsh average .
Cardiff has one of the longest-established Muslim populations in the UK, started by Yemeni sailors who settled in the city during the 19th century.
The proportion of Cardiff residents declaring themselves to be Hindu, Sikh and Jewish were all considerably higher than the Welsh averages, but less than the UK figures.
The city has been home to a sizable Hindu community since Indian immigrants settled there during the 1950s and 1960s.
The first Hindu temple in the city was opened in Grangetown on 6 April 1979 on the site of an abandoned printing press .
In the 2001 census 18.8% of the city's population stated they had no religion, while 8.6% did not state a religion.
University Hospital of WalesThere are seven NHS hospitals in the city, the largest of which is the University Hospital of Wales .
The University Hospital of Wales is the third largest hospital in the UK and deals with most accidents and emergencies.
The University Dental Hospital, which provides emergency dental treatment, is also located on this site.
Llandough Hospital is located in the south of the city.The city's newest hospital, St. David's Hospital  is located in the Canton area and provides services for the elderly and children.
Cardiff Royal Infirmary is located on Newport Road, near the city centre.
The majority of this hospital was closed in 1999 but with the West Wing remaining open for clinic services, genitourinary medicine and rehabilitation treatment.
Rookwood Hospital and Whitchurch Hospital are also located within the city, along with Rookwood Hospital and Velindre Cancer Centre.
All hospitals in Cardiff are administered by the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board , See also: List of tallest buildings in CardiffAs the capital city of Wales, Cardiff is the main engine of growth in the Welsh economy.
Though the population of Cardiff is about 10% of the Welsh population, the economy of Cardiff makes up nearly 20% of Welsh GDP and 40% of the city’s workforce are daily in-commuters from the surrounding south Wales area.
Industry has played a major part in Cardiff's development for many centuries.
The main catalyst for its transformation from a small town into a big city was the demand for coal required in making iron and later steel, brought to the sea by packhorse from Merthyr Tydfil .
This was first achieved by the construction of a 25-mile  to the Taff Estuary at Cardiff.
Eventually the Taff Vale Railway replaced the canal barges and massive marshalling yards sprang up as new docks were developed in Cardiff – all prompted by the soaring worldwide demand for coal from the South Wales valleys.At its peak, Cardiff's port area, known as Tiger Bay , became the busiest port in the world and—for some time—the world's most important coal port.
Today, Cardiff is the principal finance and business services centre in Wales, and as such there is a strong representation of finance and business services in the local economy.
This sector, combined with the Public Administration, Education and Health sectors, have accounted for around 75% of Cardiff's economic growth since 1991.
Notable companies such as Legal & General , Admiral Insurance, HBOS , Zurich , ING Direct , The AA , Principality Building Society , 118118 , British Gas , Brains , SWALEC Energy and BT , all operate large national or regional headquarters and contact centres in the city, some of them based in Cardiff's office towers such as Capital Tower and Brunel House.
Other major employers include NHS Wales and the National Assembly for Wales.

Cardiff is home to the Welsh media and a large media sector with BBC Wales , S4C and ITV Wales all having studios in the city.
Cardiff has several regeneration projects such the St David's 2 Centre and surrounding areas of the city centre, and the £1.4 billion International Sports Village in Cardiff Bay which played a part in the London 2012 Olympics .
It features the only Olympic-standard swimming pool in Wales, the Cardiff International Pool , which opened on 12 January 2008.According to the Welsh Rugby Union, the Millennium Stadium has contributed £1 billion to the Welsh economy in the ten years since it opened , with around 85% of that amount staying in the Cardiff area.
St. David's is the largest shopping centre in WalesThe majority of Cardiff's shopping portfolio is in the city centre around Queen Street and St. Mary Street, with large suburban retail parks located in Cardiff Bay, Culverhouse Cross , Leckwith , Newport Road and Pontprennau , together with markets in the city centre and Splott .
A major £675 million regeneration programme for Cardiff's St. David's Centre was completed in 2009, which has provided a total of 1,400,000 square feet  of shopping space, making it one of the largest shopping centres in the United Kingdom.
The Castle Quarter is a commercial area in the north of the city centre which includes some of Cardiff's Victorian and Edwardian arcades : Castle Arcade, High Street Arcade and Duke Street Arcade, and principal shopping streets: St Mary Street, High Street , Castle Street and Duke Street.
Development of the area began in February 2010 and is expected to be completed by July 2011.
Cardiff Council says that work to create the Castle Quarter as a pedestrian friendly environment for High Street and St Mary Street is designed to enhance the city centre.
Cardiff is sixth best city in the United Kingdom for shopping, according to a poll in November 2009, surpassing other cities such as Bristol , Leeds , Edinburgh and Newcastle upon Tyne .

In Māori , Auckland's name is Tāmaki Makaurau and the transliterated version of Auckland is Ākarana.The Auckland urban area  ranges to Waiwera in the north, Kumeu in the northwest, and Runciman in the south.
It is not contiguous; the section from Waiwera to Whangaparaoa Peninsula is separate from its nearest neighbouring suburb of Long Bay .
Auckland lies between the Hauraki Gulf of the Pacific Ocean to the east, the low Hunua Ranges to the south-east, the Manukau Harbour to the south-west, and the Waitakere Ranges and smaller ranges to the west and north-west.
The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow isthmus between the Manukau Harbour on the Tasman Sea and the Waitemata Harbour on the Pacific Ocean.
It is one of the few cities in the world to have two harbours on two separate major bodies of water.The 2014 Mercer Quality of Living Survey ranked Auckland 3rd place in the world on its list, The isthmus was settled by Māori around 1350, and was valued for its rich and fertile land.
Many pā  were created, mainly on the volcanic peaks.
Māori population in the area is estimated to have been about 20,000 people before the arrival of Europeans.
After the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in February 1840 the new Governor of New Zealand, William Hobson , chose the area as his new capital and named it after George Eden, Earl of Auckland then Viceroy of India .
and the transfer of the administration from Russell  was seen as a better choice for an administrative capital because of its proximity to the South Island , and Wellington became the capital in 1865.
After losing its status as capital Auckland remained the principal city of the Auckland Province until the provincial system was abolished in 1876.In response to the ongoing rebellion by Hone Heke in the mid-1840s the government encouraged retired but fit British soldiers and their families to migrate to Auckland to form a defence line around the port settlement as garrison soldiers.
By the time the first Fencibles arrived in 1848 the rebels in the north had been defeated so the outlying defensive towns were constructed to the south stretching in a line from the port village of Onehunga in the West to Howick in the east.
Each of the four settlements had about 800 settlers, the men being fully armed in case of emergency but spent nearly all their time breaking in the land and establishing roads.In the early 1860s Auckland became a base against the Māori King Movement .
This, and continued road building towards the south into the Waikato , enabled Pākehā  influence to spread from Auckland.
Its population grew fairly rapidly, from 1,500 in 1841 to 12,423 by 1864.
The growth occurred similarly to other mercantile -dominated cities, mainly around the port and with problems of overcrowding and pollution.
Auckland had a far greater population of ex soldiers, many of whom were Irish, than other settlements.
About 50% of the population was Irish which contrasted heavily with the majority English settlers in Wellington, Christchurch or New Plymouth .
Most of the Irish, though not all, were from Protestant Ulster .
The majority of settlers in the early period were assisted by receiving a cheap passage to New Zealand.Trams and railway lines shaped Auckland's rapid expansion in the early first half of the 20th century, but soon afterward the dominance of the motor vehicle emerged and has not abated since; arterial roads and motorways have become both defining and geographically dividing features of the urban landscape.
They also allowed further massive expansion that resulted in the growth of urban areas such as the North Shore , and Manukau City in the south.Economic deregulation in the mid-1980s led to dramatic changes to Auckland's economy and many companies relocated their head offices from Wellington to Auckland.
The region was now the nerve centre of the national economy.
Auckland also benefited from a surge in tourism, which brought 75% of New Zealand's international visitors through its airport.
In 2004, Auckland's port handled 43% of the country's container trade.
The face of urban Auckland changed when the government's immigration policy began allowing immigrants from Asia in 1986.
According to the 1961 census data, Māori and Pacific Islanders comprised 5% of Auckland's population; Asians less than 1%.
Auckland straddles the Auckland volcanic field , which has produced about 90 volcanic eruptions from 50 volcanoes in the last 90,000 years.
It is the only city in the world built on a basaltic volcanic field that is still active.
It is estimated that the field will stay active for about 1 million years.
Surface features include cones, lakes, lagoons, islands and depressions, and several have produced extensive lava flows.
Some of the cones and flows have been partly or completely quarried away.
The individual volcanoes are all considered extinct, although the volcanic field itself is merely dormant .
The trend is for the latest eruptions to occur in the north west of the field.
Auckland has at least 14 large lava tube caves which run from the volcanoes down towards the sea.
Some are several kilometres long.
A new suburb, Stonefields , has been built in an excavated lava flow, north west of Maungarei / Mount Wellington , that was previously used as a quarry by Winstones.Auckland's volcanoes are fuelled entirely by basaltic magma , unlike the explosive subduction -driven volcanism in the central North Island, such as at Mount Ruapehu and Lake Taupo which are of tectonic origin.
The most recent and by far the largest volcano, Rangitoto Island , was formed within the last 1000 years, and its eruptions destroyed the Māori settlements on neighbouring Motutapu Island some 700 years ago.
Rangitoto's size, its symmetry, its position guarding the entrance to Waitemata Harbour and its visibility from many parts of the Auckland region make it Auckland's most iconic natural feature.
Few birds and insects inhabit the island because of the rich acidic soil and the type of flora growing out of the rocky soil.Harbours, gulf and riversAuckland lies on and around an isthmus , less than two kilometres wide at its narrowest point, between Mangere Inlet and the Tamaki River .
There are two harbours in the Auckland urban area surrounding this isthmus: Waitemata Harbour to the north, which opens east to the Hauraki Gulf , and Manukau Harbour to the south, which opens west to the Tasman Sea .
The total coastline of Auckland is 3,702 kilometres  long.
Bridges span parts of both harbours, notably the Auckland Harbour Bridge crossing the Waitemata Harbour west of the Auckland Central Business District .
The Mangere Bridge and the Upper Harbour Bridge span the upper reaches of the Manukau and Waitemata Harbours, respectively.
In earlier times, portage paths crossed the narrowest sections of the isthmus.Several islands of the Hauraki Gulf are administered as part of Auckland, though they are not part of the Auckland metropolitan area.
Parts of Waiheke Island effectively function as Auckland suburbs , while various smaller islands near Auckland are mostly zoned 'recreational open space' or are nature sanctuaries.Auckland also has a total length of approximately 21,000 kilometres  of rivers and streams, about 8 percent of these in urban areas.
View of the Central Business DistrictAccording to the NIWA , Auckland has a subtropical climate , with warm, humid summers and mild, damp winters.
The early morning calm on the isthmus during settled weather, before the sea breeze rises, was described as early as 1853: "In all seasons, the beauty of the day is in the early morning.
At that time, generally, a solemn stillness holds, and a perfect calm prevails...".
Many Aucklanders use this time of day to walk and run in parks.Auckland occasionally suffers from air pollution due to fine particle emissions.
Precipitation is relatively abundant all year round, but is higher in winter.
The west of Auckland is slightly wetter and cooler than the eastern side, with the gulf islands being warmer and drier still.See also: Culture of New ZealandHelen Clark , Prime Minister in this 2006 photo, being welcomed onto Hoani Waititi Marae in Glen EdenAuckland is home to many cultures.
The majority of inhabitants claim European – predominantly British and/or Irish – descent, but substantial Māori , Pacific Islander and Asian communities exist as well.
Auckland has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world and a higher proportion of people of Asian origin than the rest of New Zealand.
Ethnic groups from all corners of the world have a presence in Auckland, making it by far the country's most cosmopolitan city.Almost 2 in 5 Aucklanders .
Auckland's population is predominantly of European origin, though the proportion of those of Asian or other non-European origins has increased in recent decades due to immigration, The following table shows the ethnic profile of Auckland's population, as recorded in the 2001, 2006, & 2013 New Zealand Censuses .
Anglican church in RemueraSimilar to the rest of the country, over half of Aucklanders profess Christianity , but fewer than 10% regularly attend church and almost 40% profess no religious affiliation .
The main denominations are Anglican , Roman Catholic , and Presbyterian .
Pentecostal and charismatic churches are the fastest growing.
A small community of Coptic Orthodox Christians is also present.
Recent immigration from Asia has added to the religious diversity of the city, and about 10% of the population follow such beliefs as Buddhism , Hinduism , Islam and Sikhism , although there are no figures on religious attendance.
Auckland's lifestyle is influenced by the fact that while it is 70% rural in land area, 90% of Aucklanders live in urban areas  – though large parts of these areas have a more suburban character than many cities in Europe and Asia.Positive aspects of Auckland life are its mild climate, plentiful employment and educational opportunities, as well as numerous leisure facilities.
Meanwhile, traffic problems, the lack of good public transport, and increasing housing costs have been cited by many Aucklanders as among the strongest negative factors of living there, In 2011, Auckland is ranked by the Mercer consulting firm as 149 of 214 centres for affordability, i.e. making it one of the most affordable cities world-wide to live in, with living expense of $20000 per year., based on the comparative cost of 200 aspects of life including housing, transport, food, clothing, household goods.
Takapuna Beach located in North Shore CityOne of Auckland's nicknames, the "City of Sails", is derived from the popularity of sailing in the region.
135,000 yachts and launches are registered in Auckland, and around 60,500 of the country's 149,900 registered yachtsmen are from Auckland,  The Waitemata Harbour has several popular swimming beaches, including Mission Bay , Kohimarama , Devonport , and Takapuna .
The west coast has popular surf spots such as Piha , Muriwai and Bethells Beach .
The Whangaparaoa Peninsula , Orewa , Omaha and Pakiri , to the north of the main urban area, are also popular.
Many Auckland beaches are patrolled by surf lifesaving clubs, such as Piha Surf Life Saving Club the home of Piha Rescue .
All surf lifesaving clubs are part of the Surf Life Saving Northern Region .Queen Street , Britomart , Ponsonby Road , Karangahape Road , Newmarket and Parnell are popular retail areas, whilst the Otara and Avondale fleamarkets offer an alternative shopping experience on weekend mornings.
Most shopping malls are located in the middle- and outer-suburbs, with Sylvia Park and Westfield Albany being the largest.The modern section of the Auckland Art Gallery , completed in 2011A number of arts events are held in Auckland, including the Auckland Festival , the Auckland Triennial, the New Zealand International Comedy Festival , and the New Zealand International Film Festival .
The Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra is the city and region's resident full-time symphony orchestra, performing its own series of concerts and accompanying opera and ballet.
Events celebrating the city's cultural diversity include the Pasifika Festival , Polyfest, and the Auckland Lantern Festival , all of which are the largest of their kind in New Zealand.
Additionally, Auckland regularly hosts the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and Royal New Zealand Ballet .Important institutions include the Auckland Art Gallery , Auckland War Memorial Museum , New Zealand Maritime Museum , National Museum of the Royal New Zealand Navy , and the Museum of Transport and Technology /.
The Auckland Art Gallery is considered the home of the visual arts in New Zealand with a collection of over 15,000 artworks, including prominent New Zealand and Pacific Island artists, as well as international painting, sculpture and print collections ranging in date from 1376 to the present day.
In 2009 the Gallery was promised a gift  of fifteen works of art by New York art collectors and philanthropists Julian and Josie Robertson – including well-known paintings by Paul Cézanne , Pablo Picasso , Henri Matisse , Paul Gauguin and Piet Mondrian .
This is the largest gift ever made to an art museum in Australasia.View from the top of Maungawhau / Mount EdenAuckland Domain is one of the largest parks in the city, close to the Auckland CBD and having a good view of the Hauraki Gulf and Rangitoto Island .
Smaller parks close to the city centre are Albert Park , Myers Park , Western Park and Victoria Park .While most volcanic cones in the Auckland volcanic field have been affected by quarrying, many of the remaining cones are now within parks, and retain a more natural character than the surrounding city.
Prehistoric earthworks and historic fortifications are in several of these parks, including Mount Eden , North Head and Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill .Other parks around the city are in Western Springs , which has a large park bordering the MOTAT museum and the Auckland Zoo .
The Auckland Botanic Gardens are further south, in Manurewa .Ferries provide transport to parks and nature reserves at Devonport , Waiheke Island , Rangitoto Island and Tiritiri Matangi .
The Waitakere Ranges Regional Park to the west of Auckland offers beautiful and relatively unspoiled bush territory, as do the Hunua Ranges to the south.Rugby union , rugby league , football, cricket and netball are widely played and followed.
Auckland has a considerable number of rugby union and cricket grounds, and venues for motorsports, tennis, badminton, netball, swimming, soccer, rugby league, and many other sports.Eden Park is the city's primary stadium and a frequent home for international rugby union and cricket matches, in addition to Super Rugby matches where the Blues play their home games.North Harbour Stadium is mainly used for rugby union and Football matches, but is also used for concerts.
Home Stadium for North Harbour in the ITM Cup .Mt Smart Stadium is used mainly for rugby league matches and is home to the New Zealand Warriors of the NRL , and is also used for concerts, previously hosting the Auckland stop of the Big Day Out music festival every January.ASB Tennis Centre is Auckland's primary tennis centre, hosting international tournaments for men  in January each year.Vector Arena is an indoor arena.

It is New Zealand's largest ocean swim.
The 'Round the Bays' fun-run , starting in the city and going 8.4 kilometres  along the waterfront to the suburb of St Heliers .
It attracts many tens of thousands of people and has been an annual March event since 1972 .
Auckland hosted the 1950 British Empire Games and the 14th Commonwealth Games in 1990 , Most major international corporations have an Auckland office, as the city is the economic capital of the nation.
The most expensive office space is around lower Queen Street and the Viaduct Basin in the Auckland CBD , where many financial and business services are located, which make up a large percentage of the CBD economy.
A large proportion of the technical and trades workforce is based in the industrial zones of South Auckland .The largest commercial and industrial areas of Greater Auckland are in the southeast of Auckland City and the western parts of Manukau City, mostly bordering the Manukau Harbour and the Tamaki River estuary.The sub-national GDP of the Auckland region was estimated at US$47.6 billion in 2003, 36% of New Zealand's national GDP, 15% greater than the entire South Island.
Auckland's status as the largest commercial centre of the country reflects in the high median personal income  and Wellington .
While office workers still account for a large part of Auckland's commuters, large office developments in other parts of the city, for example in Takapuna or Albany , both on the North Shore, are slowly becoming more common, reducing concentration on the Auckland CBD somewhat.See also: List of schools in the Auckland RegionThe Auckland urban area has 340 primary schools, 80 secondary schools, and 29 composite  schools as of February 2012, catering for nearly quarter of a million students.
The majority are state schools, but 63 schools are state-integrated and 39 are private.
The city is home to some of the largest schools in New Zealand, including Rangitoto College in the East Coast Bays area, the largest school in New Zealand with 3056 students as of July 2015.
The University of Auckland clock tower building is a 'Category I' historic place, completed in 1926 Auckland has a number of important educational institutions, including some of the largest universities in the country.
Auckland is a major centre of overseas language education, with large numbers of foreign students  coming to the city for several months or years to learn English or study at universities – although numbers New Zealand-wide have dropped substantially since peaking in 2003.
Amongst the more important tertiary educational institutes are the University of Auckland , Auckland University of Technology , Massey University , Manukau Institute of Technology and Unitec New Zealand .Housing varies considerably between some suburbs having state owned housing in the lower income neighbourhoods, to palatial waterfront estates, especially in areas close to the Waitemata Harbour.
Traditionally, the most common residence of Aucklanders was a standalone dwelling on a ' quarter acre ' .
Auckland's housing is amongst the least affordable in the world, based on comparing average house prices with average household income levels  and Auckland's high level of liveability.In some areas, the Victorian villas have been torn down to make way for redevelopment.
The demolition of the older houses is being combated through increased heritage protection for older parts of the city.
The Auckland Council is the local council with jurisdiction over the city of Auckland, along with surrounding rural areas, parkland, and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf.From 1989 to 2010 Auckland was governed by several separate city and district councils.
In the late 2000s  were hindering Auckland's progress.
A Royal Commission on Auckland Governance was set up in 2007,  Many aspects of the reorganisation were or are still controversial , from matters such as the form of representation for Maori, the inclusion or exclusion of rural council areas in the city, to the role of council-controlled organisations that are intended to place much of the day-to-day business of council services at arms length from the elected Council.In October 2010, Manukau City mayor Len Brown was elected the mayor of the amalgamated Auckland Council .
He was re-elected for a second term in October 2013.
Twenty councillors make up the remainder of the Auckland Council governing body, elected from thirteen electoral wards.Between 1842 and 1865, Auckland was the capital city of New Zealand.
Parliament met in what is now Old Government House on the University of Auckland 's City campus.
The capital was moved to the more centrally located Wellington in 1865.Auckland, because of its large population, is covered by 21 general electorates and three Maori electorates, each returning one member to the New Zealand House of Representatives .
In addition, there are a varying number of Auckland-based List MPs, who are elected via party lists.
As of 2012, there are twelve list MPs in the House who contested Auckland-based electorates at the 2011 election .Private vehicles are the main form of transportation within Auckland, with around 7% of journeys in the Auckland region being undertaken by bus , Bus services in Auckland are mostly radial, with few cross-town routes.
Late-night services  are limited, even on weekends.
A major overhaul of Auckland's bus services is planned to be implemented by 2016, significantly expanding the reach of "frequent" bus services: those that operate at least every 15 minutes during the day and early evening, every day of the week.
Rail services operate along four lines travel between the CBD and the west, south and south-east of Auckland, with longer-distance trains operating to Wellington only a few times each week.
A number of proposed projects to further extend Auckland's rail network were included in the 2012 Auckland Plan , including the City Rail Link , rail to Auckland Airport , the Avondale-Southdown Line and rail to the North Shore .Auckland's ports are the second largest of the country, behind the Port of Tauranga ,  and a large part of both inbound and outbound New Zealand commerce travels through them, mostly via the facilities northeast of Auckland CBD.
Freight usually arrives at or is distributed from the port via road, though the port facilities also have rail access.
Auckland is a major cruise ship stopover point, with the ships usually tying up at Princes Wharf .
Auckland CBD is connected to coastal suburbs, to the North Shore and to outlying islands by ferry.Auckland has various small regional airports and Auckland Airport , the busiest of the country.
Auckland Airport, New Zealand's largest, is in the southern suburb of Mangere on the shores of the Manukau Harbour.
There are frequent services to Australia, and to other New Zealand destinations.
There are also direct connections to many locations in the South Pacific, to the United States, Asia and to Santiago in South America.
Research at Griffith University has indicated that in the last 50 years, Auckland has engaged in some of the most pro-automobile transport policies anywhere in the world.
The State Highway network connects the different parts of Auckland, with State Highway 1 being the major north-south thoroughfare through the city .
State Highway 22 is a non-motorway rural arterial connecting Pukekohe to the Southern Motorway at Drury .The Auckland Harbour Bridge , openend in 1959, is the main connection between the North Shore and the rest of the Auckland metropolitan area.
The Harbour Bridge provide eight lanes of vehicle traffic with a moveable median barrier, but does not provide access for rail, pedestrians or cyclists.
The Central Motorway Junction , also called 'Spaghetti Junction' for its complexity, is the intersection between the two major motorways of Auckland .Two of the longest arterial roads within Greater Auckland are Great North Road and Great South Road – the main connections in those directions before the construction of the State Highway network.
Numerous arterial roads also provide regional and sub-regional connectivity, with many of these roads  previously used to operate Auckland's former tram network along.Auckland has three main railway lines  with branch lines to Manukau and Onehunga .
These railway lines serve the general western, southern and central eastern parts of Auckland from the Britomart Transport Centre in downtown Auckland, the terminal station for all lines, where connections are also available to ferry and bus services.
There are plans to connect Britomart with the Western Line near Mt Eden, via an underground rail tunnel known as the City Rail Link project.Auckland is New Zealand's largest electricity consumer, and uses around 20% of the country's total electricity each year.
Vector, which operates the majority of Auckland's local distribution system, measured maximum demand to be 1722 MW in 2011, with 8679 GWh delivered.
There are two major electricity generation stations located within the city, both of which are natural gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine stations.
Otahuhu B is owned by Contact Energy and generates 380 MW, while Southdown is owned by Mighty River Power and generates 175 MW.
Since there is not enough generation in Auckland to meet the demand, and there is very little generation north of Auckland, most of the electricity for Auckland and Northland must be transmitted from power stations in the south, mainly from Huntly Power Station and the Waikato River hydroelectric stations.Transpower owns the national grid and is responsible for the high voltage transmission lines into and across Auckland.
Five major 220 kV transmission lines connect Auckland with the Waikato, terminating into Otahuhu and Brownhill substations.
The sub-transmission and distribution network in the Auckland region is mostly owned by Vector .
The network south of central Papakura is owned by Counties Power.There have been several notable power outages in Auckland.
The five-week-long 1998 Auckland power crisis blacked out much of the CBD after a cascade failure occurred on four underground cables in Mercury Energy's sub-transmission network.
The 2006 Auckland Blackout interrupted supply to the CBD and many inner suburbs after an earth wire shackle at Transpower's Otahuhu substation broke and short-circuited the lines supplying the inner city.
In 2009, much of the northern and western suburbs, as well as all of Northland , experienced a blackout when a forklift accidentally came into contact with the Otahuhu to Henderson 220 kV line, the only major line supplying the region.
Transpower spent $1.25 billion in the early 2010s reinforcing the supply into and across Auckland, including a 400 kV-capable transmission line from the Waikato River to Brownhill substation , and 220 kV underground cables between Brownhill and Pakuranga, and between Pakuranga and Albany via the CBD .
These reduced the Auckland Region's reliance on Otahuhu substation and northern and western Auckland's reliance on the Otahuhu to Henderson line.Auckland is expecting substantial population growth via immigration and natural population increases ,  This substantial increase in population will have a major impact on transport, housing and other infrastructure that is in many cases already considered under pressure.
It is also feared by some organisations, such as the Auckland Regional Council , that urban sprawl will result from the growth and, as a result, that it is necessary to address this proactively in planning policy.A 'Regional Growth Strategy' has been adopted that sees limits on further subdivision and intensification of existing use as its main sustainability measures.
According to the 2006 Census projections, the medium-variant scenario shows that the population is projected to continue growing, to reach 1.93 million by 2031.
The high-variant scenario shows the region's population growing to over two million by 2031.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .Line and length in cricket refers to the direction and point of bouncing on the pitch of a delivery .
The two concepts are frequently discussed together.The line of a delivery is the direction of its trajectory measured in the horizontal plane .
More simply, it is a measure of how far to the left or right the ball is travelling, compared to a line drawn straight down the pitch.
It is usually referred to in terms of the directions off , rather than left and right, however.Line controls how much room the batsman has to play various shots, and sometimes dictates what shot he must play.
A line directed at the wicket , for example, must be defended with the bat, as failing to hit the ball will result in the batsman being out bowled , whilst a batsman blocking the ball with the body is likely to be out leg before wicket .Despite this most direct method of getting the batsman out, bowlers often concentrate their line outside off stump , where the batsman does not necessarily have to hit the ball to avoid being out.
A line just outside off stump is sometimes referred to as the corridor of uncertainty , as the batsman may be in two minds whether or not he needs to hit the ball to prevent it hitting his wicket.
In this state, the batsman has little choice but to attempt to hit the ball, as not doing so could be disastrous.
By thus forcing the batsman to play at the ball with some element of uncertainty, the bowler's goal is to induce a poorly executed shot that may offer a catch to a fielder, or ricochet the ball into the wicket.Line can also be used strategically to restrict run scoring.
One method is to stack the fielders predominantly on either the leg or off side of the field, and then bowl consistently with a matching line, to make it difficult for the batsman to hit the ball to the opposite side of the field.A deliberate policy of aiming the line of the ball at the batsman's body was employed by England during their 1932-1933 tour of Australia .
This dangerous tactic has since been outlawed.
See Bodyline for full details.The length of a delivery is how far down the pitch towards the batsman the ball bounces.
It is described as being either short .The length of a ball controls how high the ball rises from the pitch as it reaches the batsman's stance position.
A ball pitched too short rises relatively high and loses some of its pace, making it easier to hit.
A ball pitched too long does not have time to deviate horizontally in its flight, also making it easier for the batsman to hit.
A good length ball is a compromise between these two, bouncing far enough from the batsman for lateral deviation to be significant, but not so far that he can react easily to hit it.
For quick bowlers the "good length ball"  it is usually at about three to four metres before the batsman, though the optimal length will vary according to the state of the pitch, prevailing climatic conditions and the height and playing style of the batsman.A bowler can use variation in length to upset the rhythm of a batsman.
A typical sequence would be a series of slightly short balls to force the batsman into playing shots with his weight on the back foot, to allow him more time to hit the ball, followed by a full ball bouncing near the batsman's legs.
If the batsman does not react to the change in length quickly enough, he can be left with his weight on the back foot and, if he misses the ball with his bat, in danger of being out either bowled or leg before wicket .Another attacking ploy is to pitch a ball very short, making it bounce up around head height as it passes the batsman.
Such a bouncer requires the batsman to avoid being hit, and may intimidate him into uncertainty about the next few balls.Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License ; additional terms may apply.

Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , a non-profit organization.In this Indian name , the name Ravichandran is a patronymic , not a family name , and the person should be referred to by the given name , Ashwin.; born 17 September 1986) is an Indian international cricketer.
He is a right-handed batsman and right-arm off break bowler.
He plays for Tamil Nadu in domestic cricket and the Chennai Super Kings in Indian Premier League .
He is the fastest Indian bowler to reach the 50- and 100-wicket mark in Test cricket .
Having achieved little success as an opening batsman at junior-level cricket, Ashwin dropped down the order and turned into an off break bowler.
He made his first-class debut for Tamil Nadu in December 2006, but it was not until the 2010 Indian Premier League that he came into the limelight.
Playing for the Chennai Super Kings, he impressed with his economical bowling in the tournament, in which he was used to open the bowling on several occasions, and earned his maiden international call-up in the limited-overs formats.
He was the leading wicket-taker and player of the tournament of the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 in South Africa.
He was also part of the Indian squad that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup .
Later that year, he made his Test debut against West Indies and became the seventh Indian to take a five-wicket haul on Test debut.
He took two five-wicket hauls and scored a century in that series and won the player of the series award.Ashwin continued to succeed in the subcontinent but proved to be less effective in other places.
In a home Test series against Australia in 2013, he took 29 wickets, the most by any Indian bowler in a four-match Test series.
The same year, he took his 100th Test wicket in his 18th match, becoming the fastest Indian bowler ito the milestone and the fastest in the world in over 80 years.
Ashwin is the only bowler of recent times apart from Sri Lanka's Ajantha Mendis to bowl the carrom ball .
With two centuries and five half-centuries in his Test career so far, Ashwin has earned the reputation of being a bowling all-rounder .
He was a recipient of the Arjuna Award in 2014 and the BCCI's international cricketer of the year for the 2012–13 season .Early years and personal lifeAshwin was born in a Tamil family.
He did his schooling from Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan and St. Bede's .
He attended SSN College of Engineering and graduated with a B.Tech in Information Technology.Ashwin plays as an all-rounder for Tamil Nadu cricket team and South Zone.
He plays for Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League .
He was the highest wicket taker of the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 tournament for Chennai Super Kings in the tournament with 13 wickets and was adjudged as the player of the tournament.In the back of his impressive performance in the 2010 Indian Premier League , Ashwin was selected in a second-string squad that toured Zimbabwe in May–June 2010.
He made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka on 5 June 2010, scoring a 32–ball 38 and taking 2/50 in that match which India lost to crash out of the tri-series .
Ashwin played in all five matches of the home series against New Zealand in November–December 2010.
India completed a 5–0 whitewash and Ashwin ended up as the leading wicket-taker of the series with 11 wickets at an average of 21.90.
He played only two matches in the World Cup and made his World Cup debut in March 2011 against the West Indies with bowling figures of 2/41 in 10 overs.
He bowled his full quota in the quarterfinal against Australia at Ahmedabad and picked 2/52.
India went on to win the tournament, but Ashwin did not feature in either the semifinal or the final.Ashwin replaced vice-captain Harbhajan for the fourth and fifth ODIs of India's tour of West Indies in June–July 2011, but picked just one wicket.
Ashwin was retained in the limited-overs squad for the England tour .
He emerged as India's best bowler of the series, which India lost 3–0, taking six wickets at an average of 25.16.
In November 2011, West Indies toured India for three Tests and five ODIs.
Ashwin's recent ODI success saw him being included in the Test squad for the first time.
Ashwin and Ojha were the only two specialist spinners in the squad, with Harbhajan being omitted owing to his indifferent form during the England tour.
Ashwin was ineffective on India's 2011/12 tour of Australia .
He played in three Tests on the tour taking nine wickets at an average of more than 62. Ashwin returned to form during the two-match home Test series against New Zealand.
In the first Test at Hyderabad, he claimed 6/31 and 6/54 helping India seal an innings victory and was named man of the match.
His match figures of 12/85 bettered S. Venkataraghavan 's 12/152 for the best figures by an Indian bowler against New Zealand in Tests.
During the first Test of England's tour of India in late-2012, Ashwin became the fastest Indian to record 50 wickets in Test cricket as he overhauled the milestone in his ninth game.
Ashwin was highly successful on Australia's four-Test tour of India in February–March 2013.
In the first Test at Chennai, his home ground, he took 7/103 and 5/95 leading India to a comfortable eight-wicket victory.
Ashwin also became the third Indian off spinner to take 25-plus wickets in a series after E. A. S. Prasanna and Harbhajan Singh .Ashwin was a member of the Indian team that won the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy in England.
His figures of 2/15 in four overs in the 20-overs-a-side final helped India restrict England to 124/8 and win the match by five runs.
On India's tour of South Africa , Ashwin had a difficult time with the ball.
He picked only one wicket across three ODIs and went wicketless in his 42 overs in the first Test at Johannesburg, following which, he lost his spot in the team to Jadeja for the second Test.
In early-2014, Ashwin's overseas struggles continued during the New Zealand tour where he managed to bag a solitary wicket in the five match ODI series which India lost 4–0.
In the two-match Test series that followed, Jadeja was preferred over Ashwin as the lone spinner in the playing eleven.Ashwin was back among the wickets when India went to Bangladesh for the 2014 Asia Cup and the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 .
He took nine wickets in four matches of the Asia Cup and finished as the joint-third highest wicket-taker of the tournament.
Ashwin was part of the Indian team that toured England in 2014 .
He played his first match of the Test series only in the fourth game in which he scored 40 and 46 not out but went wicketless in an innings defeat for India.
He took three wickets in the last match, which was another innings defeat.
India and Ashwin found more success in the ODI series followed.
With India winning the series 3–1, Ashwin took seven wickets from four matches at an average of 24.85 and economy rate of less than 4.5.
He was also selected for India's tour of Australia in 2014-15.
Ashwin was selected to represent India for the second consecutive ODI World cup to be held in Australia-New Zealand in 2015.In the 2015 three-match series against Sri Lanka , he dismissed Kumar Sangakkara , who was retiring following the second Test, four consecutive times in his final four innings.
At the end of the series, he finished with 21 wickets and in the process broke the record for most wickets by an Indian bowler in a series against Sri Lanka.
He was awarded the Man of the Series.
Ashwin is a tall off-spinner who primarily relies on the bounce of the pitch to get his wickets.
He produces a lot of variations of the ball and flights the ball thereby giving it more chance to spin and dip on the batsman.
In addition to his normal off-breaks , he produces an arm ball and the carrom ball , the latter of which he uses frequently in the shorter formats.
In IPL 2013 , he bowled leg-breaks and googly as well.
Ashwin became the fastest Indian bowler to reach 100 test wickets as he got to the milestone in his 18th Test match.
The previous record holder was legendary Indian spinner Erapalli Prasanna who got there in his 20th test.
Ashwin also became the 5th fastest bowler in the world to reach 100 Test wickets after G Lohmann .
Ashwin became the first Indian cricketer to score a century and take five wickets in same test match on 2 separate instances.
He achieved this double for the first time in his third Test against West Indies in 2011 when he made 103 and took 5/156 in the first innings.
He repeated the same feat in the Kolkata test against West Indies in November 2013 where he took 2/52 in the 1st innings and 3/46 in the 2nd innings and scored 124 in India's 1st innings.
Other Indians to have done this once are Vinoo Mankad in 1952 and Polly Umrigar in 1962.
This feat had only been achieved 26 times previously in world cricket, the last occasion being by Jacques Kallis in 2002.Ashwin scored a hundred and took nine wickets when India played against West Indies at the Wankhede Stadium in 2011.
Only four other India players have hit a hundred and taken five or more wickets for the match.
Ashwin is the only one to do it twice.
The 280-run partnership between Rohit Sharma and Ashwin was India's highest in Tests for the seventh wicket, beating the unbeaten 259-run partnership between VVS Laxman and MS Dhoni against South Africa at the same venue in 2010.
This was also the second-highest partnership for India against West Indies for any wicket in Tests.In December 2012, Ashwin completed 500 runs in his 11th Test cricket match.
With this, he shares the record of becoming the fastest player along with Australia’s Jack Gregory and England’s Ian Botham , who also took 11 Tests to reach the mark of completing the all-round double of 500 runs and 50 wickets.Ashwin is also the third Indian cricketer to be awarded the Man of the Match  on debut.
Other Indians to have done this before him were Narendra Hirwani , Pravin Amre , R.P. Singh .
Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan achieved this feat after Ashwin.
Ashwin registered the 2nd best bowling on debut by an Indian bowler with 9/128, behind Hirwani’s 16-wicket world record debut performance.
Ashwin became the fastest Indian to record 50 wickets in Test matches as he overhauled the milestone in his ninth game.
He achieved it when he dismissed the England opener Nick Compton on 16 November 2012 during the second day of the first Test at Ahmedabad .
The previous record holder was the legendary Anil Kumble , who had reached the milestone in his tenth Test.
On 8 December 2012, Ashwin completed 500 runs in his 11th Test cricket match when batting against England scoring 91*.
With this he shares the record of becoming the fastest player along with Australia’s Jack Gregory and England’s Ian Botham , who also took 11 Tests to reach the mark of completing the all-round double of 500 runs and 50 wickets.
Incidentally the quickest Indian to reach 500 runs and 50 wickets before Ashwin was Salim Durani , who did so in his 14th Test, followed by Vinoo Mankad in 15 tests and Kapil Dev in 16.Ashwin has surpassed former India captain Anil Kumble as the leading wicket-taker for India in a four-Test series.
Ashwin claimed his 28th wicket of Border-Gavaskar Trophy  at the Feroz Shah Kotla, New Delhi.
The previous record of 27 had been achieved by Kumble against Australia too, during the 2004–05 edition of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
Ashwin and Rohit Sharma together put on a record 7th partnership of 280 Runs for India in the first test against West Indies.^ a b"Australia tour of India , 2nd ODI: India v Australia at Visakhapatnam, Oct 20, 2010" .

Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , a non-profit organization.Look up not out in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.In cricket , a batsman will be not out if he comes out to bat in an innings and has not been dismissed by the end of the innings .
One may similarly describe a batsman as not out while the innings is still in progress.
A batsman's score is often appended with an asterisk to indicate that he was not out; for example, '10*' is read '10 not out'.At least one batsman will be not out at the end of an innings, because once ten batsmen are out, the eleventh will have no partner to bat on with.
Two batsmen will be not out if a declaration is made in first-class cricket , and often at the end of the scheduled number of overs in limited overs cricket .
A batsman further down the batting order than the not-out batsmen will not come out to the crease at all and is noted as did not bat rather than not out; by contrast, a batsman who comes to the crease but faces no balls is not out.
A batsman who retires hurt is considered not out; an uninjured batsman who retires is considered retired out .Batting averages are calculated as runs divided by outs, which means that a player who often ends the innings not out may get an inflated batting average.
However, the flip side of the argument is that, if not outs were counted for the purpose of batting averages, a good batsman could come in and only have time to make 0 not out, facing three balls from a bowler , and thus get unduly penalised for factors out of his control.
This argument is prevailing among cricket statisticians, who have used this method of collecting batting averages since the 18th century.
Furthermore, a batsman will tend to be at his most vulnerable early in an innings before he has "got his eye in"; as a result it may be considered a greater achievement to achieve two scores of 20 not out and 20  than to make one score of 40, since in the latter instance the batsman will only have had to negotiate the start of one innings.^

born 1 November 1974), commonly known as V. V. S. Laxman, is a former Indian cricketer.
Laxman bats right-handed and occasionally bowls off-spin.
He is noted for his superb timing and the ability to hit against the spin, reminiscent of his role model Mohammed Azharuddin .
Laxman is particularly noted for the skilful use of his supple wrists, which allow him to flick the ball to various places, but usually through the leg side.
This also helps in his catching, and he typically fields in the slips or in a bat pad position.Laxman is noted most for his batting against Australia , in both Tests and One Day Internationals .
Six out of his 17 Test hundreds, and four out of his six ODI hundreds have come against Australia.
Laxman was born in Hyderabad in Telangana .
He married G. R. Shailaja from Guntur , who is a post-graduate in computer applications on 16 February 2004.
They have two children – a son, Sarvajit and a daughter, Achinthya.Recently he attended Food for Change along with Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Pulela Gopichand for the charity event of educating 2 lakh students.Laxman is known for his "wristy, willowy and sinuous" style, one which is technically fluid at its best.
Laxman's on-side playing capability is comparable with his fellow Hyderabadi Mohammed Azharuddin 's.
The Australians once admitted that they did not know where to bowl to him.
Laxman is widely criticised as a slow runner between the wickets and he is one of the few players who have played 100 Tests but have never played in the Cricket World Cup .
Despite being a slow runner between wickets, Laxman could score rapidly as he was such a fine stroke player and could play freely for long periods of time.VVS Laxman with his family at Teri University , receiving the doctoral degree.Technically sound, Laxman stands tall and still at the crease, with a keen awareness of the off-stump and a polished ability to dispatch the bad ball.
He plays with a high elbow and a steady stance and a textbook technique with natural elegance and flair.
At the start of his career, Laxman was rated by Geoffrey Boycott as one of India's best current players of the hard  ball.
Indian selectors also thought on those lines and asked Laxman to open on a number of occasions.
But Laxman came into his own only when he was asked to bat in the middle order.
Laxman has played some of his best match-winning innings while playing at no. 3, no. 5 and no. 6.
His score of 281 against Australia rang in a new era of Indian dominance which culminated in India gaining the no. 1 spot in test cricket a few years later.
His 281 is rated by many as the best ever innings played by an Indian batsman.
He made that score while batting at number 3, having been moved up the order from no. 6 for the second innings of the test match.Laxman made his Under-19 debut for India against Australia in February 1994.
Laxman made his first-class debut for Hyderabad against Punjab in the quarter-final match of 1992–93 Ranji Trophy season.
He scored a duck in the first innings and 17 in the second.
Laxman made his Test debut in 1996 against South Africa at Ahmedabad , scoring a fifty in the second innings of the match.
Laxman returned to playing first-class cricket in 1999 to regain his place in the national team.
In the 1999–2000 season of Ranji Trophy, he broke the record for most runs in a Ranji season when he made 1415 runs, at an average of 108, in just 9 matches notching up eight hundreds – a record that still remains intact.
His performance was rewarded when, in January 2000, he was recalled in the Indian squad for the Australian tour.
He scored 167 in the third and final Test match at Sydney when the rest of the batsmen struggled to cope with Glenn McGrath 's destructive bowling,  a rare high point for India in an otherwise disastrous tour.
Despite this success against an attack containing both McGrath and Shane Warne , Laxman apparently decided that he would return to domestic cricket, rather than continue playing as opener, a role which he believed did not suit him.
As a result, Laxman was out of the Test team for nearly a year.
He was recalled in late 2000, and also found a spot in the side for the home series against Australia in 2001.Australia's tour of India Laxman's career changed dramatically in the home series against Australia .
In the first Test at Mumbai , Laxman made 20 and 12, as the entire Indian batting line-up, with the exception of Sachin Tendulkar , capitulated, leading to a 10-wicket defeat.
West Indies and Australia tours Laxman then cemented his place both in the Test and one day teams for a few years.
After bad performances in the Test series against Zimbabwe , he did well in the first two ODIs scoring 75 and 52, but couldn't convert the starts into big knocks in the next three matches.
Laxman managed to score a fighting 89 in the second Test at Port Elizabeth , when the rest of the team struggled to survive against Shaun Pollock 's deadly bowling, helping his team put up 201 on the board and avoid an embarrassing follow-on.
Against the touring England in late 2001, he scored 75, sharing a 100-plus run partnership with Tendulkar to take his team out of trouble.
He had a great tour of West Indies , as he scored 474 runs in 8 innings at an average of 79.
He had scores of 69, 69*, 74, 1, 43, 130, 65* and 23 in that series.
He performed reasonably well during West Indies tour of India as well, particularly in the third match at Kolkata , where he scored 48 and 154*.
He followed it up with brilliant showing in the 7-match ODI series as well with scores of 47, 99, 66 and 71 in the first five games.
But his form dropped during India's tour of New Zealand in 2002/03.
In the first Test at Wellington , he got a pair and in the second match he could score only 23 and 4.
However, he had a brilliant 2-match Test series against the same team in India as he scored a half-century along with 44 in the first Test and 104* and 67* in the second match.
He won the Man of the Series award for his impressive batting performances in the two Test match series.
In October 2003, he scored 102 in the first ODI against Australia at Gwalior , sharing a 190-run second wicket partnership with Tendulkar.
However he failed to deliver on a consistent basis in ODIs.
He continued to perform well against Australia, especially during India's tour of Australia in 2003–04, in which he hit three ODI and two Test centuries.
He was involved in two century partnerships, one with Tendulkar and the other with Dravid, in the Brisbane ODI against Australia where he remained unbeaten on 102.
His 106* against the same opponents at Sydney saw him put up a fourth-wicket partnership of 213 runs with Yuvraj Singh , who scored his career-best 139.
In the next ODI against Zimbabwe, Laxman scored a 138-ball 131, once again setting up 2 hundred-run stands.
He scored 148 in the famous Adelaide Test, sharing a triple century partnership with Rahul Dravid , which India won by 4 wickets.
This was their first Test victory in Australia in two decades.
His innings of 178 at Sydney also came in a triple century partnership, on this occasion with Sachin Tendulkar .
India went on to post 705/7 in their first innings which is their highest total in Test cricket.
Laxman scored a total of 494 runs from the 4 Tests at a staggering average of 82.
During this series, Ian Chappell described Laxman as Very Very Special Laxman.
His 107  against Pakistan in the fifth and the final ODI at Lahore , helped India win by 40 runs and clinch the series 3–2.Decline of form However, Laxman's form was on the decline since the series against Australia.
Beginning with the series in Pakistan in 2004, Laxman had only Test centuries to his credit, with one coming against a weak Zimbabwe side.
He averaged just 31 in the Test series in Pakistan in 3 matches.
His only half-century  in the last match at Ahmedabad .
Laxman was dropped after scoring a duck in the first Test against England at Nagpur in March 2006.
He regained his place for the tour of the West Indies in place of the injured Tendulkar, and made a hundred in the third Test.
He also scored a resilient 63 in the second innings to deny West Indies the victory in the same match.
In ODIs, Laxman was left out persistently since Greg Chappell took over as coach in mid-2005, mainly on account of his slow ground fielding and running between the wickets; Laxman is a highly regarded close-catching fielder in stationary positions but in ODIs, these positions are generally disused except for the opening phases of the match, and players otherwise have to patrol substantial spaces and retrieve balls.
Another reason was a perception that his batting is too one paced for ODI cricket and that he lacks the ability to score at a high rate as required when the batting team has the momentum, or in the closing stages of the innings.
This was despite his superb form in Australia and Pakistan in early 2004, when he made four centuries in 14 games, including three in a week in the VB Series in Australia.In December 2005, Laxman helped India to victory against Sri Lanka with a fine century.
In June 2006, Laxman again rescued India from a difficult position against the West Indies with a gritty century.
In November 2006, he was selected in the test squad for India's tour of South Africa.
In the first test in Johannesburg Laxman scored 73 in the second innings to help India claim a historic 123 run win.
In the 2007 tour of England Laxman produced three good innings, two of which were half-centuries and a vital 39 that helped India draw the first test at Lords.
He passed the 5000 run landmark in the first day of the final test.After the tests he joined Lancashire as their overseas player in place of Brad Hodge .
He played in five games of the county championship and showed glimpses of his sublime batting.
In their final County Championship game of 2007, against Surrey at the Oval, Laxman scored a century in the second innings which Lancashire were chasing 489 to win.
They just missed out by 25 runs and subsequently lost the Championship to Sussex.
His performance for Lancashire was good with 380 runs scored in 5 matches at an average of 54.28 with 2 centuries and 2 half-centuries In India's home series against Pakistan in 2007, V.V.S. Laxman once again showed his importance to the team with a disciplined batting performance in the 1st Test at Delhi , as he scored 72* in dire circumstances.
This ensured his place on the tour of Australia which would be his third to that country.Sublime form from end of 2007 till May 2011Laxman's good form continued in the 2007/08 Test series against Australia with him scoring 109 against Australia on the second day of the controversial Sydney Test to put India back into the contest.
It was his 12th hundred in Test matches, and his 5th against Australia.
It was also his third consecutive century at SCG , giving him an average well above 90 at the venue.
He followed this up with a gritty knock of 79 in Perth , assisted by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and RP Singh , which set India up to record a historic and unexpected victory at a ground on which previously no Asian team had won.
He hit 51 in the first innings of the final Test at Adelaide.
He finished as the second highest run-getter for India in that series, only behind Sachin Tendulkar .He, like all other Indian batsmen, struggled in Sri Lanka against the spin duo of Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis later in July–August that year.
India lost the first Test by an innings and 239 runs at Colombo , where Laxman's first innings score of 50 was the only half-century scored by an Indian batsman in either innings.
Laxman scored another fifty in that series, in the third Test, an unbeaten 61 as India went on to lose the game by 8 wickets and the series 2–1.
Laxman was dismissed by Mendis on all five occasions in that series.
He also crossed the 6000-run milestone during the series.Laxman was supposed to replace Adam Voges for Nottinghamshire , but this move was vetoed by the BCCI due to the fact that there are players from the rival Indian Cricket League playing for Nottinghamshire.Against Australia, in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy later that year, Laxman was in top form as he scored 381 runs from 4 Tests with a double-hundred and two fifties.
During the third Test at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi, Laxman scored an unbeaten 200 in the first innings with characteristic use of his wrists and flicks through the leg side.
In the same innings, Gautam Gambhir scored 206, Laxman and Gambhir becoming the first pair of batsmen to score double-centuries in the same innings for India, and the first to do so against Australia.
This was his second double-century in Test cricket with the previous one coming against the same opponents.
He made an unbeaten 59 in the second innings and was named Man of the Match.
The match was also the last game of India's spin wizard Anil Kumble who was also the captain of the team.
In the final Test at Nagpur , Laxman scored another half-century in the first innings of the match.In 2009, Laxman continued to be in brilliant form.
He had scored 76 and 124* in the 2nd Test at Napier in New Zealand.
The century helped India salvage a draw and avoid an innings defeat.
In the next match at Wellington he hit a well-composed 61 in the second innings.
Against Sri Lanka later that year in a home series, Laxman hit three fifties in four innings as India went on to win the series comfortably.
His unbeaten 51 in the second innings combining with a hundred from Tendulkar helped India draw the first Test at Ahmedabad .
Laxman scored two fifties in the next two games as India went on to win both matches by an innings.He injured himself during the first match of the two-match Test series in Bangladesh in January 2010 after scoring another unbeaten half-century.
The injury forced him to sit out for three weeks and he returned to action only during the final Test against South Africa held in Kolkata .
He scored 143* in a record stand for the seventh wicket with MS Dhoni .
The test was eventually won by India by an innings and 57 runs in the last 10 minutes of the fifth day's play, despite centuries in both innings from South African batsman Hashim Amla .
This victory also helped India draw the Test series and remain the world Number 1 team.
He also passed 7000 Test runs during the innings.Laxman helped India to level the series with Sri Lanka in August 2010 when he hit 103 not out in the run-chase, resulting in a five-wicket win in the Third Test, after scoring 69 in the first innings.
He was awarded the Man of the Match for this brilliant effort.
He scored a total of 279 runs in that series at an average of 70.
In October, he once again turned around another match that appeared headed for a comfortable Australian victory, in the first Test in Mohali.
Laxman was suffering with a back problem and needed Suresh Raina as his runner, and the Indians had collapsed to 124/8 in pursuit of 216.
He and paceman Ishant Sharma put on 81 to take the score to 205 before Sharma fell.
Last man Pragyan Ojha then managed to survive till the end as the hosts completed a thrilling one-wicket win.

Laxman's 38 was the highest score in that innings.
In the second innings, India were struggling at 94/5 and he put on crucial partnerships with Dhoni and Zaheer Khan to help his team to 228, giving South Africa a target of 303.
South Africa were bundled out for 215 giving India an 87-run win that helped level the series 1–1.
He was awarded the Man of the Match for his match-winning innings of 96.In three test matches, Laxman scored three consecutive fifties including two scores in eighties against the West Indies during India's tour of West Indies in June 2011.June 2011 to RetirementDuring India's Tour to England, Laxman scored just two half-centuries in eight innings as India went down 0–4 to England.
This was India's first Test series loss since the 2007/08 India Tour of Australia.
Laxman got out with the pull shot frequently in this series, which otherwise he is good at.
As part of West Indies tour to India in September 2011, Laxman scored a magnificent 176 not out in the second test, but India had to settle for a draw.
Laxman was adjudged Man of the match.
India went on to win the series 1–0.
Laxman again failed to live to his expectations during India's tour of Australia in November 2011, as India went down 0–4 to Australia with Laxman scoring only two half centuries in eight innings.
For the first time in four tours to Australia, Laxman failed to register a century in the series; and also for the first time in four test matches played at Sydney Cricket Ground he failed to touch the three figure mark.
Post this series, there were calls from the media and former Cricketers that it was time for the seniors like Laxman, Dravid and Sachin to take a call on their international career.Laxman was originally named as the Icon Player for his home franchise Deccan Chargers before the first season of IPL.
But he gave up the Icon Player status in a bid to allow his team spend a bigger purse at the auction.
The Deccan Chargers bought him at the auction for $375,000 and named him the captain for the first season.
However, Laxman dropped himself from the team halfway through the season, after the team had a horrendous in the tournament.
Adam Gilchrist took over as the captain and led the side in the next two seasons as well.
Although, Laxman did scored 155 runs from the 6 games that he played at an average of 31 and strike rate of 118.
He batted at 3 in the first few games before opening the innings with Gilchrist in some matches where he found more success.
His only half-century of the tournament  came against Royal Challengers Bangalore .
He did score a couple more of fluent innings that season including the unbeaten 37 from 26 balls against the Mumbai Indians and 48 from 34 balls against Kings XI Punjab .
However, he struggled with the bat in the next two seasons and sat out of the tournament after playing only 5–6 matches.At the mega-auction in 2011, Laxman was bought by the newly formed franchise of Kochi Tuskers Kerala for $400,000.
This time, though, he was injured after the first three games and missed the rest of the season.
In the first match against Royal Challengers, he opened the innings with Brendon McCullum and scored an attractive 36 from 29 deliveries.
But, the Kochi franchise was terminated later that year and all the players of the team were put in the auction in 2012.
However, Laxman, who had a base price of $400,000, found no buyers and he couldn't participate in the 2012 edition of the tournament.Then in IPL 2013, he was appointed as a mentor for Sunrisers Hyderabad Team.On 18 August 2012, Laxman announced his retirement from international cricket.
Although he was selected for the upcoming New Zealand series, he opted not to play in the series but he will play in domestic cricket for Hyderabad and the Indian Premier League .
Wisden Cricketer of the Year : 2002.He is one of the few cricketers to score the most number of centuries  in a single ODI series.
His innings of 281 against Australia at Kolkata in 2001 was ranked sixth in Wisden 's list of 100 great Test innings in the history of the game.He has the record of taking the most number of catches  by a non-wicketkeeper in an single ODI series.
He shares this record with Allan Border .
He along with Rahul Dravid share the world record for the highest partnership in 3rd innings of a test match for any wicket during a winning cause.

Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , a non-profit organization.Ishant Sharma , the India fast bowler, has said that his ankle has healed and that he, in all probability, no longer needs surgery to fix it.
Ishant, who played the first Test against the West Indies in Delhi, had sustained a ligament injury to his left ankle during the third Test against England at Edgbaston earlier this year.
He was forced to miss the limited-overs part of the England tour and the subsequent one-day series against the same opponents in India, but recovered in time to play against West Indies."There is no risk about it ," Ishant told reporters after India's practice session on Sunday.
I've been working a lot on my ankle and everything.
I am fit now and I am ready to play in Australia, and I don't think even after the Australia tour I will need surgery."Zaheer
Khan , India's leading fast bowler, has been out of action since the first Test in England back in June.
With offspinner Harbhajan Singh also missing, having been dropped for the first two Tests against West Indies, Ishant has been catapulted into the role of India's senior strike-bower, a role he said he was happy to fill."Obviously it's a great feeling ... It's an honour to lead the Indian attack.
Being the senior-most bowler in the team, it's really great.
It's difficult to express this kind of feeling actually.
You are obviously going to miss a bowler like Zak .
But injuries are part and parcel of the game.
You have to play the role of the senior when someone is injured.
Whoever you have in the team, you need to go ahead and give your best shot."Given
India's recent spate of injuries, the selectors have taken the opportunity to blood a few new players during the recently completed one-day series against England and the first Test against West Indies.
Among the new faces in the ODIs were Umesh Yadav and Varun Aaron , while Yadav played in the Test win over West Indies in Delhi.
Both bowlers impressed with their pace and Ishant said it was a "great feeling" to be part of an attack that can bowl quick."Earlier,
everyone was saying that India can't produce fast bowlers.
Now all the three fast bowlers are consistently clocking 90 miles per hour.
Obviously it's a great feeling for any fast bowler in the team."When he was asked why India's bowlers failed to get reverse-swing at the Feroz Shah Kotla, Ishant it was difficult to do so on the first day when the track was fresh.
"The only thing you can do is to be consistent and bowl in the right areas.
As the day progresses, you get reverse-swing.
Reverse-swing happens only on second or third day of a Test match."The
Australia tour is after this series.
We will get two practice matches there to get accustomed to the conditions.
In India, the wickets are like this only.
We can't complain about this."Yah definetly I am shocked that Indian fast bowlers are clocking +140.
Umesh did it with all 6 balls in an over  A false impression was given by English fans that we could not.
We are doing it on our flat tracks - imagine when we hit Australia.
Also we were doing bowling faster than Windies bowlers.Romenevans on November 14, 2011, 13:20 GMTi hope he is saying the truth!padmanabhangg on November 14, 2011,  2:54 GMTAs usual the phenomenon of having for the first time a genuine quick attack has been lost to most viewers.
I hope Yadav and Varun should both be selected with Ishant.
Three fast bowlers are a must for Australia and they must be groomed now in the Windies Tests.satish619chandar on November 14, 2011,  2:17 GMTIshant is more sensible these days and is more consistent.. Hope he stays fit during entire Australian tour.. And, Zak too!!
We need them both to sustain the pressure which Australians are mounting now..vamanan on November 14, 2011,  2:02 GMTIshant have been playing international matches for more than 4 years.
He should be knowing the work load and his body balance better than the spectators and his fans.
Its important to allow the player to feel free and not to bulldoze him with the opinion about his injuries or recoveries - Any one for that matter, captain, coach, board,... any one.
Fans of Team India became too technical about everything - coaching, physique building, treatments, how a player should manage temperament, etc. ;)Incisor on November 14, 2011,  0:46 GMTI hope all is well with Ishant.
I can't wait to see him come down to Australia in the summer and work some magic.
I have always felt for him having to bowl on some of the flat dust bowls over in the sub-continent.
He has not lost his pace, he has been overbowled in less than perfect fast bowling conditions.
I predict he'll have a good summer vs Australia.Vilander on November 13, 2011, 19:12 GMTIshant might be doing a mistake, he did not want to build muscle earlier in his career when coaches suggested it.
Now he thinks he can go with out surgery, hope he knows what he is doing.on
November 13, 2011, 16:20 GMTyes, ishant bowled with good pace in the 2nd innings and seems to have recovered rather well.
Indian selectors should continue with the trend and play him and other genuine quick bowlers only for tests.
Odi s can always be played with bowlers like munaf and vinay.on
November 13, 2011, 14:36 GMTBig Risk by deciding to delay the surgery and now deciding not to have it altogether.The Captain and Coach ought to coax Ishant to change his decision.If he breaks down in Australia could well end up as a chronic injury that will limit the number of games he plays.Already he has the odd day when he looks to have run out of steam every now and then.That said he is a long term prospect and has to be handled well in terms of fitness issues.Percy_Fender on November 13, 2011, 14:35 GMTNot just Ishant I am sure even Zaheer will be fit for Australia because the selectors have shown  that they can do without them with Yadav and Aaron available.
Once India are no longer No 1, it hardly matters whether the galacticas who made it possible are available.
A new order beckons and the Bhajjis of the past will realise that it is better to be humble and not so sure of their continuance.Naresh28 on November 14, 2011, 15:38 GMTYah definetly I am shocked that Indian fast bowlers are clocking +140.

Steyn is widely regarded as the best fast bowler of his generation.
He currently has the best bowling strike rate of all time in Test match cricket .
He dominated the number one spot in the ICC test rankings for several years between 2008 and 2014.
Early life and Domestic careerDale Steyn grew up in the small town of Phalaborwa on the border of the world-famous wildlife haven, the Kruger National Park .
Active and energetic, Steyn was naturally drawn to sports.
His love of being outdoors led him also to more solitary activities such as bass fishing and skateboarding.
Steyn began playing cricket when he was around 11 years old and he received a Hansie Cronje cricket set as a Christmas gift.
Family games on the lawn soon led to a place in the school cricket team.
During his high school years at Merensky High School in the town of Tzaneen, Steyn had exceptional pace and a raw talent, but a career in cricket didn’t seem possible.
“When you live in a small town and there is just a handful of players, it doesn’t really count that you may be the cream of the crop,” Steyn comments “People might say you’re destined for great things.
But when you’re in a small town, what are the chances?”Steyn made his first-class debut for Northerns  on 17 October 2003.
He only played two first-class games and made little impact in his first season, but a series of strong performances in the initial part of the 2004/2005 season saw him called up to the Test squad to play England .

Despite his strong performance on his return to the team in the third Test against India, Steyn missed out on a place in the first two Tests against Pakistan , with the selectors opting to play a four-man attack featuring full-time spinner Paul Harris .
He returned in the third Test, at Cape Town , when the selectors decided to rest André Nel and Shaun Pollock in preparation for the imminent 2007 Cricket World Cup .

Steyn's form continued into the Test series.
He had a fairly indifferent match in the first Test at Port Elizabeth , taking 5/188 in the match as the West Indies scored their first away victory in Test matches for two and a half years, although he did hit his highest Test match score to date, 33 not out, in South Africa's second innings.

Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , a non-profit organization.The 2015 Cricket World Cup was the 11th Cricket World Cup , jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand from 14 February to 29 March 2015.
Fourteen teams played 49 matches in 14 venues, with Australia staging 26 games at grounds in Adelaide , Brisbane , Canberra , Hobart , Melbourne , Perth and Sydney while New Zealand hosted 23 games in Auckland , Christchurch , Dunedin , Hamilton , Napier , Nelson and Wellington .
The hosting rights were awarded at the same time as those of the 2011 Cricket World Cup , which Australia and New Zealand had originally bid to host, and the 2019 Cricket World Cup , which was awarded to England.
The 2011 tournament was awarded to the four Asian Test cricket playing countries, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh .
The International Cricket Council were sufficiently impressed with the trans-Tasman bid that it was decided to award the next World Cup to Australia and New Zealand.
This was the second time the tournament was held in Australia and New Zealand, with the first being the 1992 Cricket World Cup .India were the defending champions, having won the tournament in 2011 .
Tickets for the Pool B match between India and Pakistan , played on 15 February 2015, reportedly sold out within 12 minutes of going on sale.
The final match of the tournament took place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground between co-hosts New Zealand and Australia in front of a record crowd of 93,013  Australia defeated New Zealand by 7 wickets to win their fifth ICC Cricket World Cup .The ICC announced the hosts for the previous World Cup, the 2011 competition , on 30 April 2006.
Australia and New Zealand had also bid for the tournament and a successful Australasian bid for the 2011 World Cup would have seen a 50–50 split in games, with the final still up for negotiation.
The Trans-Tasman bid, Beyond Boundaries, was the only bid for 2011 delivered to the ICC headquarters at Dubai before the 1 March deadline.
Considerable merits of the bid included the superior venues and infrastructure, and the total support of the Australian and New Zealand governments on tax and custom issues during the tournament, according to Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland .
ICC President Ehsan Mani said that the extra time required by the Asian bloc to hand over its bid had harmed the four-nation bid.
However, when it came to the voting, the Asians won by seven votes to four; according to the Pakistan Cricket Board  that turned the matter.
It was reported in Pakistani newspaper Dawn that the Asian countries promised to hold fundraising events for West Indian cricket during the 2007 Cricket World Cup , which may have influenced the vote.
The ICC was so impressed by the efficiency of the Trans-Tasman bid that they decided to award the next World Cup, to be held in 2015, to them.
The tournament featured 14 teams, the same number as the 2011 World Cup, giving associate and affiliate member nations a chance to participate.
The format was the same as the 2011 edition: 14 teams take part in the initial stages, divided into two groups of seven; the seven teams play each other once before the top four teams from each group qualify for the quarter-finals.On 29 January 2015, ICC reinstated the use of the Super Over for Cricket World Cup Final match if the match finished as a tie.
Qualified via WCL or qualifierMain articles: 2011–13 ICC World Cricket League Championship and 2014 Cricket World Cup QualifierPer ICC regulations, the 10 ICC full member nations qualify for the tournament automatically.
Immediately after the 2011 World Cup, it was decided that the next tournament would be reduced to only feature the 10 full members.
At the ICC Chief Executives' Committee meeting in September 2011, the ICC decided on a new qualifying format.
The top two teams of the 2011–13 ICC World Cricket League Championship qualify directly.
The remaining six teams join the third and fourth-placed teams of 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two and the top two teams of 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three in a 10-team World Cup Qualifier to decide the remaining two places.
On 9 July 2013, as a result of a tied match against the Netherlands, Ireland became the first country to qualify for the 2015 World Cup.
Scotland defeated the United Arab Emirates in the final of the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier and both teams qualified for the last two spots in the 2015 Cricket World Cup.
In preparation for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, the organising committee of the tournament was finalised.
John Harnden was named chief executive, Allocation of matchesWhen Australia and New Zealand bid for the 2011 Cricket World Cup in 2006, they said that it will see a 50–50 split in games.
Finally, it was decided on 30 July 2013 that Australia would host 26 matches, while New Zealand got a share of 23 matches in the tournament.
There was a tense battle between Melbourne and Sydney to host the final.
It was announced that spectators travelling to World Cup matches in New Zealand who would otherwise not be entitled to a visa waiver, would be able to enter New Zealand if they held an Australian visitor visa.
This was a special Trans-Tasman Visa Arrangement for the 2015 Cricket World Cup.
Media and promotionThe World Cup has grown as a media event with each tournament.
The International Cricket Council has sold the rights for broadcasting of the 2015 Cricket World Cup for US$2 billion to ESPN Star Sports and Star Sports .
According to Strong, the Local Organising Committee  wants to make the tournament the most fan-friendly event of its kind and take cricket to a wide range of communities throughout Australia and New Zealand.
Sachin Tendulkar was named by the ICC as the World Cup Ambassador for the second time, after filling the role at the 2011 Cricket World Cup .
The opening ceremonies were held separately in Christchurch , New Zealand and Melbourne , Australia , on 12 February 2015, two days before the first two matches.The International Cricket Council declared a total prize money pool of $10 million for the tournament, which was 20 percent more than the 2011 edition.
The prize money was distributed according to the performance of the team as follows: This means that if the winner had have remained undefeated throughout the group stage of the tournament, they would have won a total of $4,245,000 , while a team which would have eliminated in the group stage without any wins would have got $35,000.Each venue hosted 3 pool stage matches.
With the quarter-finals being in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Wellington.
With the semi-finals played in Auckland and Sydney, with the final played in Melbourne.The Umpire selection panel selected 20 umpires to officiate at the World Cup: five each from Australia and England, five from Asia, two each from New Zealand and South Africa and one from the West Indies.
The teams, after initially naming a provisional 30-member squad, were required to finalise a 15-member squad for the tournament on or before 7 January 2015.
Sri Lanka's innings ended after 44.4 overs and South Africa's target was reduced to 188 from 25 overs due to rain.A total of 42 matches were played throughout the group stage of the tournament.
The top four teams from each pool qualified for the quarter-finals.
In the event that two or more teams are tied on points after six matches the team with the most number of wins was to be ranked higher.
If tied teams also had the same number of wins then they had to be ranked according to net run rate.
Australia defeated New Zealand by 7 wickets in the final of the knockout stage to win the World Cup their fifth time.While the dates and venues are fixed, which match-up they host was subject to change to accommodate the host countries should they qualify.
Both hosts qualified for the quarter-finals; Australia played the match on 20 March in Adelaide, and New Zealand played the match on 21 March in Wellington.
Since Sri Lanka, the next highest ranked team , progressed to the quarter-finals, they played in Sydney.
If England had advanced, as they were the third-highest ranked team, they would have played in Melbourne.
New Zealand's semi-final against South Africa was played on 24 March in Auckland while Australia's semi-final against India was played on 26 March is Sydney.
Both the host nations qualified for the final, where Australia defeated New Zealand by 7 wickets.The Pool A match between Australia and England ended when James Anderson was run out straight after James Taylor was given out lbw .
Because Taylor's decision was reviewed and overturned, the ICC later admitted that the ball should have been declared dead , and so Anderson was incorrectly given out.
During the Pool B match between Ireland and Zimbabwe, Sean Williams was caught by Ireland's John Mooney in a close run chase.
Mooney was extremely close to the boundary and eight different television replays were inconclusive as to whether his foot had touched the boundary rope.
Meanwhile, Williams had walked and the umpires signalled him out.
During the second quarter-final match between India and Bangladesh, Rubel Hossain bowled a full toss to Rohit Sharma who was caught at square-leg.
The umpire thought the ball was too high and declared it a no ball , meaning the batsman was not out.
Replays showed that the ball was waist height, and therefore a legal delivery.

Users access Twitter through the website interface, SMS , or mobile device app .
Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey , Evan Williams , Biz Stone and Noah Glass and launched by July 2006.
The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity, with more than 100 million users who in 2012 posted 340 million tweets per day.
A blueprint sketch, c. 2006, by Jack Dorsey , envisioning an SMS -based social network .Twitter's origins lie in a "daylong brainstorming session" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo .
Jack Dorsey , then an undergraduate student at New York University , introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.
Dorsey has explained the origin of the "Twitter" title:...we came across the word 'twitter', and it was just perfect.
The definition was 'a short burst of inconsequential information,' and 'chirps from birds'.
And that's exactly what the product was.
The first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees In October 2006, Biz Stone , Evan Williams , Dorsey, and other members of Odeo, formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets—including Odeo.com and Twitter.com—from the investors and shareholders.
Williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a 2013 interview:With Twitter, it wasn't clear what it was.
They called it a social network, they called it microblogging, but it was hard to define, because it didn't replace anything.
There was this path of discovery with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is.
Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility.
It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.
The tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive  conference.
During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.
Reaction at the conference was highly positive.
Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter was "absolutely ruling" SXSWi.
Social software researcher danah boyd said Twitter was "owning" the conference.
The first unassisted off-Earth Twitter message was posted from the International Space Station by NASA astronaut T. J. Creamer on January 22, 2010.
By late November 2010, an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts' communal account, @NASA_Astronauts.
NASA has also hosted over 25 "tweetups" , events that provide guests with VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers with the goal of leveraging participants' social networks to further the outreach goals of NASA.In August 2010, the company appointed Adam Bain from News Corp. 's Fox Audience Network as president of revenue.
The company experienced rapid growth.
It had 400,000 tweets posted per quarter in 2007.
This grew to 100 million tweets posted per quarter in 2008.
In February 2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day.
Jack Dorsey , a co-founder and the chairman of Twitter, in 2009Twitter's usage spikes during prominent events.
For example, a record was set during the 2010 FIFA World Cup when fans wrote 2,940 tweets per second in the thirty-second period after Japan scored against Cameroon on June 14.
The record was broken again when 3,085 tweets per second were posted after the Los Angeles Lakers ' victory in the 2010 NBA Finals on June 17, Twitter acquired application developer Atebits on April 11, 2010.

The application, now called "Twitter" and distributed free of charge, is the official Twitter client for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.
From September through October 2010, the company began rolling out "New Twitter", an entirely revamped edition of twitter.com.
Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites including YouTube and Flickr , and a complete overhaul of the interface, which shifted links such as '@mentions' and 'Retweets' above the Twitter stream, while 'Messages' and 'Log Out' became accessible via a black bar at the very top of twitter.com.
As of November 1, 2010, the company confirmed that the "New Twitter experience" had been rolled out to all users.On April 5, 2011, Twitter tested a new homepage and phased out the "Old Twitter."

Twitter has become internationally identifiable by its signature bird logo.
The original logo was in use from its launch in March 2006 until September 2010.
A slightly modified version succeeded the first style when the website underwent its first redesign.On February 27, 2012, a tweet from an employee that works on the company's platform and API discussed the evolution of the "Larry the Bird" logo with Twitter's creative director and it was revealed that it was named after Larry Bird of the NBA's Boston Celtics fame.
This detail had previously been confirmed when the Boston Celtics' director of interactive media asked Twitter co-founder Biz Stone about it in August 2011.
On June 5, 2012, Twitter unveiled its third logo redesign, replacing Larry the Bird with an updated icon simply named as the "Twitter Bird."
As of this logo revision, the word "Twitter" and the lowercase letter "t" are no longer used, with the bird becoming the sole symbol for the company's branding.
Tweets are publicly visible by default, but senders can restrict message delivery to just their followers.
Users can tweet via the Twitter website, compatible external applications  available in certain countries.
Users may subscribe to other users' tweets – this is known as "following" and subscribers are known as "followers"  In addition, users can block those who have followed them.Twitter allows users to update their profile via their mobile phone either by text messaging or by apps released for certain smartphones and tablets.
Twitter has been compared to a web-based Internet Relay Chat  client.
As a social network, Twitter revolves around the principle of followers.
When you choose to follow another Twitter user, that user's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page.
If you follow 20 people, you'll see a mix of tweets scrolling down the page: breakfast-cereal updates, interesting new links, music recommendations, even musings on the future of education.San Antonio -based market-research firm Pear Analytics analyzed 2,000 tweets  and separated them into six categories: Despite Jack Dorsey's own open contention that a message on Twitter is "a short burst of inconsequential information", social networking researcher danah boyd responded to the Pear Analytics survey by arguing that what the Pear researchers labelled "pointless babble" is better characterized as " social grooming " and/or "peripheral awareness" (which she justifies as persons "wantsign followed by a username is used for mentioning or replying to other users.
To repost a message from another Twitter user and share it with one's own followers, a user can click the retweet button within the Tweet.In late 2009, the "Twitter Lists" feature was added, making it possible for users to follow ad hoc lists of authors instead of individual authors.
Through SMS, users can communicate with Twitter through five gateway numbers: short codes for the United States, Canada, India, New Zealand, and an Isle of Man -based number for international use.
There is also a short code in the United Kingdom which is only accessible to those on the Vodafone , O2 The tweets were set to a largely constrictive 140-character limit for compatibility with SMS messaging, introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages.
The 140-character limit also increased the usage of URL shortening services such as bit.ly , goo.gl, and tr.im, and content-hosting services, such as Twitpic , memozu.com and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters.
Since June 2011, Twitter has used its own t.co domain for automatic shortening of all URLs posted on its website, making other link shorteners superfluous for staying within the 140 character limit.
A word, phrase or topic that is mentioned at a greater rate than others is said to be a "trending topic".
Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users, or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic.
Trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena, particularly musicians like Lady Gaga  novels.
Twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type, with limited success.
The most popular trending topics are shown in a sidebar on the Twitter home page - either the most popular topics globally, or the local trending topics .There have been controversies surrounding Twitter trending topics: Twitter has censored hashtags that other users found offensive.
Twitter censored the #Thatsafrican There are numerous tools for adding content, monitoring content and conversations including Telly , The official Twitter profile of Twitter, Inc.
The blue check mark right of the profile name confirms that it's a verified account.A verified Twitter account formally validates the identity of the person or company that owns the account—the aim of the "verified" status is to prove that a real-world person or company is not being impersonated, through the placement of a small blue checkmark by the top-right corner of a user's page, or next to the username in the platform's Search function.
The owners of verified accounts can also access additional features that are not available to standard Twitter-account holders.
These features include:The ability to choose how their notifications and mentions are presented.
Since verified accounts typically receive a lot of followers, account holders can filter these notices based on whether or not they are from verified accounts.
In a breach of Twitter's rules, some users placed the verified checkmark in their background—Twitter confirmed that such conduct is invalid.
Following a design update of the Twitter platform, it is more difficult for users to impersonate a verified account because of the layout.
A limitation of the verified status is that if the account is hacked, the person or company can still be impersonated for a limited time, until control is regained over the account by the legitimate owners - as happened, for example, with Tesla Motors ' Twitter account briefly in 2015.The mobile version of Twitter, mobile.twitter.comTwitter
has mobile apps for iPhone , iPad , Android , Windows 10 , Windows Phone , BlackBerry , Firefox OS , and Nokia S40 .
As of August 31, 2010, third-party Twitter applications are required to use OAuth , an authentication method that does not require users to enter their password into the authenticating application.
Previously, the OAuth authentication method was optional, it is now compulsory and the user-name/password authentication method has been made redundant and is no longer functional.
Twitter stated that the move to OAuth will mean "increased security and a better experience".
This feature adds websites to the bottom of a tweet's permalink page.
If a website embedded a tweet onto one of their stories, the tweet will show the websites that mentioned the tweet.
This feature was added onto Twitter so if the viewer doesn't understand what the tweet means, they can click on the sites to read more about what the person is talking about.
Twitter is ranked as one of the ten-most-visited websites worldwide by Alexa's web traffic analysis.
Note: Visitor age 15+, home and work locations.

The documents projected 2009 revenues of US$400,000 in the third quarter and US$4 million in the fourth quarter along with 25 million users by the end of the year.
The projections for the end of 2013 were US$1.54 billion in revenue, US$111 million in net earnings, and 1 billion users.
On April 13, 2010, Twitter announced plans to offer paid advertising for companies that would be able to purchase "promoted tweets" to appear in selective search results on the Twitter website, similar to Google Adwords' advertising model.
As of April 13, Twitter announced it had already signed up a number of companies wishing to advertise, including Sony Pictures , Red Bull , Best Buy , and Starbucks .
The company generated US$45 million in annual revenue in 2010, after beginning sales midway through that year; the company operated at a loss through most of 2010.

Twitter later reported that numerous small businesses and people who used the self-service tool provided feedback that indicated they were impressed by the feature.
Twitter places great reliance on open-source software .
In the early days of Twitter, tweets were stored in MySQL databases that were temporally sharded .
After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed re-engineering.
As of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack, to a Java server they call Blender.
From Spring 2007 to 2008 the messages were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling , Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called snowflake , and geolocation data is added using 'Rockdove'.
The URL shortner t.co then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL.
Next, the tweets are stored in a MySQL database using Gizzard , and the user receives acknowledgement that the tweets were sent.
Tweets are then sent to search engines via the Firehose API.
The process itself is managed by FlockDB and takes an average of 350 ms.
On August 16, 2013, Twitter's Vice President of Platform Engineering Raffi Krikorian shared in a blog post that the company's infrastructure handled almost 143,000 tweets per second during that week, setting a new record.
Krikorian explained that Twitter achieved this record by blending its homegrown and open source technologies.
The service's application programming interface  and sort out by asser tickers according to its own algorithm.On April 30, 2009, Twitter adjusted its web interface, adding a search bar and a sidebar of " trending topics " — the most common phrases appearing in messages.
Biz Stone explains that all messages are instantly indexed and that "with this newly launched feature, Twitter has become something unexpectedly important – a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now."
In March 2012, Twitter became available in Arabic , Farsi , Hebrew and Urdu , the first right-to-left language versions of the site.
About 13,000 volunteers helped with translating the menu options.

For example, comedian Conan O'Brien 's account, which had been set to follow only one person, was changed to receive nearly 200 malicious subscriptions.
In response to Twitter's security breaches, the US Federal Trade Commission  brought charges against the service; the charges were settled on June 24, 2010.
This was the first time the FTC had taken action against a social network for security lapses.
The settlement requires Twitter to take a number of steps to secure users' private information, including maintenance of a "comprehensive information security program" to be independently audited biannually.
On December 14, 2010, the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks .
A "MouseOver" exploit occurred on September 21, 2010, when an XSS Worm became active on Twitter.

For example, it has been used to organize protests, sometimes referred to as "Twitter Revolutions", which include the 2011 Egyptian revolution , 2010–2011 Tunisian protests , 2009–2010 Iranian election protests , and 2009 Moldova civil unrest .
The service is also used as a form of civil disobedience : in 2010, users expressed outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by making obvious jokes about terrorism; Another, more real time and practical use for Twitter exists as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news .
It was neither intended nor designed for high performance communication, but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication certainly was not lost on the originators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the San Francisco, California company used it to communicate during earthquakes.
Twitter has been used by Somalia 's al-Shabaab rebels, who had their accounts suspended after they used the site to claim responsibility for an attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi in September 2013.
Twitter has been blocked intermittently in numerous countries including China , Egypt , Iran , Iraq , Turkey , Venezuela on different bases.
In May 2008, The Wall Street Journal wrote that social networking services such as Twitter "elicit mixed feelings in the technology-savvy people who have been their early adopters .
Fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends.
But some users are starting to feel 'too' connected, as they grapple with check-in messages at odd hours, higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they're having for dinner."
Twitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational settings mostly in colleges and universities.
Tech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 that using Twitter for "literate communication" is "about as likely as firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad ".
The novelist Rick Moody wrote a short story for Electric Literature called "Some Contemporary Characters," composed entirely of tweets.

Twitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture, products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication.
In addition to content generating bots, users can purchase followers, favorites, retweets and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a users image through accumulation of followers.
With more followers, users' profiles gain more attention, thus increasing their popularity.
After claims in the media that the hashtags #wikileaks and #occupywallstreet were being censored because they did not show up on the site's list of trending topics, Twitter responded by stating that it does not censor hashtags unless they contain obscenities.

By February 2014, all four major U.S. TV networks had signed up to the Amplify program, bringing a variety of premium TV content onto the social platform in the form of in-tweet real-time video clips.

Wikipedia® is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. , a non-profit organization.The South African presence in the Indian coaching bench has gained further weight after the BCCI today appointed Eric Simons , the former South Africa coach, as bowling consultant for the upcoming Test series against Bangladesh, and the Test and ODI series at home against South Africa that follow.It has been learned that Simons spoke to Gary Kirsten, India's coach, last week and that was the first occasion he learned of the management's interest in him.
Simon's appointment comes after former South African fast bowler Allan Donald's name cropped up last Tuesday, as one of the contenders for the vacant bowling coach position.MS Dhoni, India's captain, recently admitted that the absence of a specialist bowling coach is hurting the team's performance.
It was no understatement, because the inconsistency in the fast bowling department has remained a concern right from the World Twenty20.
In England, Zaheer Khan had aggravated the shoulder injury he picked during the IPL in South Africa.
His inability to go full throttle exposed the younger lot like Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar, and though Ashish Nehra was around he was just finding his own feet, having made a return after a long time.
Things did not improve during the Champions Trophy, and India's problems were exacerbated during the home ODI series against Australia, which they lost 4-2.During the recently concluded Sri Lanka series the Indian fast bowlers were lukewarm even if they improved on their death bowling, and in the current tri-series in Bangladesh they have been disappointing.
They failed to defend a total of 279 against Sri Lanka and allowed Bangladesh to post 296.The 47-year-old Simons, who played 23 one-day internationals for South Africa and toured New Zealand in 1995, has a rich pedigree in the coaching profession and was South Africa's head coach from 2002-2004, a period when Kirsten played under him.
Simons spread his first-class career, mostly with Western Province, over 17 seasons as a right-arm medium pacer and a handy lower middle order batsman.He has never had any experience as a bowling coach except for the brief stint in the second IPL in South Africa last year, where he worked as a consultant with Royal Challengers Bangalore.
Simons has worked in various capacities at the prestigious High Performance Centre in Pretoria along with the likes of Kepler Wessels.2

was an Indian Test cricketer .The bearded Arun was a medium pacer and an attacking lower order batsman.
In the semifinal of the 1986/87 Duleep Trophy he hit 149 and added 221 for the seventh wicket with W. V. Raman as South Zone chased a West total of 516 for the first innings lead  .
A 107* for India Under-25 against the visiting Sri Lankans just before the selection of the side for the Tests against Sri Lanka won him a place in the side.
He was part of the Indian under 19 team that toured Sri Lanka in 1979 under the captaincy of Ravi Shastri.He played two Test matches of the series with the 3 for 76 in his first match as his best bowling figures .
