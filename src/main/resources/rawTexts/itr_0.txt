; born 2 September 1988) is an Indian cricketer who has represented India in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He is a 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in) tall [1] [2] [3] right-arm fast-medium bowler. [4]
At the age of 18, Sharma was called to join the Indian squad for the tour of South Africa in 2006–07 . However, after receiving the call and organising travel arrangements, it was decided not to send him on the tour. [5] In reference to his height and lean physique in his Under-19 days, the bowler was nicknamed Lambu. [6] [7] In 2011, he became the fifth youngest player to take 100 Test wickets. Against South Africa in 2013, Ishant Sharma became the fifth quickest Indian to grab 100 ODI wickets. [8] While being a "rhythm" bowler, he still is considered one of the fastest Indian bowlers having bowled in excess of 150 km/h on several occasions in international cricket as well as the IPL, his fastest being 152 km/h.
Ishant plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and has taken 68 wickets in 14  first-class games, [9] [10] including a five-wicket haul against Baroda on the opening day of a match Delhi drew after failing to bowl Baroda out on the fourth day. [11]
Ishant toured England with the India Under-19s in 2006 and Pakistan in 2006–07. He played three youth tests and six youth One Day Internationals for India. On the basis of his strong performance in Australia in 2008, Ishant Sharma was bought for a winning bid of $950,000 by Kolkata Knight Riders in the player auction for the Indian Premier League . This was the highest amount paid for any bowler in tournament.
In May 2007, Sharma was selected in the test team for the Bangladesh tour and played as a replacement for the fast bowler Munaf Patel . Over there he played for his national side in the second test where he bowled three overs including one maiden and conceded only five runs without taking a wicket. [12] Later on, he was called for the tour of England in July–August 2007.
Sharma got a call back in the team in the 3rd Test during Pakistan's tour of India in December 2007 due to injury of India's frontline pacers Zaheer Khan , RP Singh , and Sreesanth . [13] Sharma picked up 5 wickets during the third test in Bangalore . [14] This performance earned him a place in India's squad for the tour of Australia.
Sharma was left out in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne during the Border–Gavaskar Trophy as India retained their main fast bowlers, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh. However, in January 2008 Sharma was called to represent India once again to replace the injured Zaheer Khan in the second test at the SCG . Sharma started the first day of the match strongly and was involved in a controversial decision from Steve Bucknor when Andrew Symonds nicked the ball to keeper MS Dhoni off his bowling but was given not out. He bowled reasonably in the match, however without much luck.
Although he had little success, the management retained him for the third Test match at Perth. On the fourth day of the match he bowled an exceptional spell to Australian captain Ricky Ponting that resulted in his wicket and helped India claim victory. [15] He used the pace and bounce of the WACA wicket to trouble the batsmen. In the following test played in Adelaide he picked up two wickets and impressed everyone with his bowling. He finished the tour of Australia with figures of 6/358, an average of 59.66 and a strike rate of 101.0. [16]
On 10 February 2008, Sharma bagged four important wickets in the 4th ODI of CB Series against Australia. He ended the match with figures of 4/38 and named Man of the Match. [17] He scalped two important wickets on 18 February 2008 versus Australia in the 7th ODI of CB series. [18]
During the 2008 Test series against Australia in India , Ishant was the leading wicket-taker, with 16, and was named man-of-the-series as India won 2–0. He thereby became the first Indian paceman to win such an award in a Test series on Indian soil after Kapil Dev who won the award in 1983. He was noted for achieving reverse swing on balls sometimes as young as eight overs, and along with senior opening bowler Zaheer Khan, troubled the touring Australians. [19] He took Australian captain Ricky Ponting's wicket three times during the series, and six times in as many Tests, making the Indian press label Ponting as Ishant's bunny. [20]
However, in 2009, Ishant's form slumped, and he was dropped for the second Test against Sri Lanka, replaced by Sreesanth .
On 5 October 2010, Ishant helped VVS Laxman pull off a highly unlikely win over Australia by one wicket in the first Test in Mohali after India had fallen to 8/124 in pursuit of 205. Ishant provided Laxman with support during an 81-run partnership in which he contributed 31 valuable runs.
In the 2011 IPL auction, Sharma was bought by the Deccan Chargers ; he hoped that his performance in the competition would give him a chance to impress selectors and push for selection in India's ODI team. [21] From 12 matches, Sharma took 11 wickets at an average of 28.54. [22] A month after the IPL, which was held in April and May, India toured the West Indies for five ODIs and three Tests . Several senior players were rested from the ODI side and others absent through injury; this mostly affected the batsmen but Zaheer Khan missed the ODI series. [23] India won the first three ODIs, and Sharma was called into the team for the fourth, his first ODI since August 2010. [24] [25] He managed one wicket from two matches in the series while conceding 109 runs. [26] The first Test resulted in a win for India and Sharma took three wickets in each innings. [27] He claimed his 100th Test wicket in the second Test, becoming the fifth youngest to reach the landmark; the fixture was also the first time he took ten wickets in a match for India. [28] [29] The second and third Tests ended in draws and India won the series 1–0; [30] Sharma was the leading wicket-taker on either side with 22 dismissals at an average of 16.86. [31]
After the tour of West Indies, India suffer a run of eight consecutive defeats in away Tests. In July and August the team played four Tests in England . England inflicted a 4–0 whitewash on India, [32] and in the process replaced India as No. 1 ranked Test team. [33] Playing in all four matches, Sharma managed 11 wickets at an average pushing 60. [34] During the series Sharma suffered an anckle injury and missed the ODI leg, but was sufficiently reovered to face the West Indies in November when India hosted them for three Tests. [35] While India won 2–0, Sharma managed five wickets from three matches at a cost of in excess of 65 runs each. [36] Sharma played in all four Tests of India's tour of Australia in 2011–12 . India lost the series 4–0, while Sharma took five wickets at the cost of 451 runs. [37]
In March 2012, Sharma underwent surgery on his ankle which had been troubling him for over a year. The operation meant that he missed the 2012 IPL. [38]
In 2013 Ind vs Aus ODI series, he gave away 30 runs in an over, equalling the most expensive over by an Indian bowler. (Yuvraj Singh had conceded 30 runs against England in an ODI match in 2007) [39]
After some bad performances against Australia in 2013 ODI series, he came back strongly against South Africa taking 4/40 in the third ODI on 11 December 2013 at SuperSport Park , which was his 2nd best performance in ODIs. [40]
In the 2014 tour of England , Sharma secured his career best figures of 7/74 at the Lord's , with an aggressive spell in England's second innings, bowling India to a 95-run win. [41] India finished the series losing 3–1. He finished the 2015 three-match Test series in Sri Lanka with 13 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul in the third Test at SSC . At the end of the match, he was handed a one match ban by the International Cricket Council (ICC), following an altercation with Dhammika Prasad in the course of the match. [42] The series also saw him pick his 200th wicket in Tests. [43] India won the series 2–1.
A right arm fast-medium bowler, the speed of Sharma's bowling has diminished since he emerged on the international scene, [44] although in 2008 he bowled a delivery at Source: ESPNcricinfo , 01 Octomber 2015

Sangakkara is described as one of the "most polished and prudent of batsmen" in cricket. [10] [11] Along with AB de Villiers , he has dominated the number one spot in the ICC Test batting rankings over the past decade. On 12 August 2015, Sangakkara was placed at number 5 in the ICC Test rankings. [12]

He won the Man of the Match award in the final of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, where he helped the team win their first title.
He was the youngest person and the first active international player to deliver Crowdrey lecture, which was widely praised by the cricketing community for its outspoken nature. [13] [14]
In terms of number of innings required, Sangakkara is the fastest batsman to reach 8,000, 9,000, 11,000 and 12,000 runs in Test cricket. He is also joint fastest to 10,000. [15] He won the ICC Cricketer of the Year in 2012, Test Cricketer of the Year in 2012, and ODI Cricketer of the Year multiple times in 2011 and 2013.

On January 29, 2015, Sangakkara became Sri Lanka's highest ever ODI run scorer, surpassing the previous record of 13430 runs held by Sanath Jayasuriya . In the same match, he also broke the record for ODI wicketkeeping dismissals, breaking the previous record of 472 held by Adam Gilchrist .
Early life[ edit ]
Sangakkara was born to Kumari Surangana and Swarnakumara Sangakkara, an attorney-at-law at Matale , Sri Lanka in 1977. [19] His parents settled in Kandy , where he grew up in his childhood. Sangakkara received his primary and secondary education at Trinity College , Kandy , an independent elite private boys' school situated in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. He has two sisters: Thushari and Saranga, and an elder brother: Vemindra, all who have made national level achievements during their school-life. Sangakkara too started playing a number of sports: badminton, tennis, swimming, table tennis and cricket at the junior school. He was able to win national colours for badminton and tennis at his younger age. The then principal of the Trinity College, Leonard de Alwis, advised his mother to encourage Sangakkara to concentrate on cricket. [20]
His parents hid Tamil families during the Black July riots in 1983. [21]
He represented his school's under-13 cricket XI under coach Upananda Jayasundera. [19] Berty Wijesinghe coached Sangakkara for under-15, under-17, under-19 and first XI squads. [22] He was awarded The Trinity Lion , the most prestigious prize awarded to a Trinity sportsman, for his exceptional batting and wicket-keeping skills in the 1996 season, at the age of 19. [23] Sangakkara was selected to represent Sri Lanka A cricket team at a tour to South Africa in 1998–99. His knock of unbeaten 156 against Zimbabwe A team at a one-day match, [24] helped him secure a place at the Sri Lankan national cricket team later that year.
Sanga was the Senior Prefect (Head Boy) of school, he did his Advanced Level examination in the Arts stream in 1996. He was also awarded the highest honour of Trinity College, the Ryde Gold Medal , for the best all-round student in his year. Following his father, who is a lawyer in Kandy, he entered the Law Faculty of the University of Colombo , but was unable to finish his degree due to cricket tours. [25] Sangakkara was a chorister and played the violin during his school-days. [26] He was cited as an inspiration to continue his higher education by Bangladeshi captain Mushfiqur Rahim , upon receiving his master's degree:
It is appreciated that someone like Sangakkara's sports personality is shaped by his education. He is obviously an inspiration. [27]
Early career[ edit ]
At the age of 22 Sangakkara made his Test debut on 20 July 2000, keeping wicket in the first fixture of a three-match series against South Africa . Sri Lanka won the match and in his side's only innings Sangakarra batted at the fall of the third wicket and scored 23 runs before he was dismissed leg before wicket by spin bowler Nicky Boje . [28] He made 35 runs in his One day cricket debut [29] [30] against Pakistan and he received his first man of the match award in the 2nd match of the Singer Triangular Series, 2000, scoring 85 runs against South Africa. [31] He ended the series with 199 runs, at an average of 66.33, securing his place for the upcoming Test series against South Africa. Before reaching his first Test century , he was twice dismissed in the 90s, once against each of South Africa and England. In August 2001, India toured Sri Lanka for three Tests and in the opening match Sangakkara scored his first century. [32] His innings of 105 not out at number three helped set up a ten-wicket victory for Sri Lanka. [33] Later that year Sangakkara scored his second Test century, this time in the first of three matches against the touring West Indians . [34]
He scored his first double-century against Pakistan in 2002, at the 2nd Asian Test Championship final. [35] His performance helped Sri Lanka secure the Test championship. In April 2003, Sangakkara made his first ODI century against Pakistan, in a losing effort. [36] Together with Marvan Atapattu , he made a partnership of 438 for the 2nd wicket—4th highest in the world—against Zimbabwe in 2004. [37] In that game, he scored 270, his first 250+ score. [38] In July 2005, he was selected to the ICC World XI ODI team but missed out from its Test counterpart .
As vice-captain[ edit ]
Sangakkara (right) resigned the captaincy after the 2011 World Cup and was succeeded by Tillakaratne Dilshan (left).
When Sri Lanka toured Bangladesh in February 2006 regular captain Marvan Atapattu was injured and Mahela Jayawardene became captain while Sangakkara was made vice-captain. [39] Pakistan toured Sri Lanka for two Test and three ODIs in March 2006, and with Atapattu still injured Jayawardene and Sangakkara remained captain and vice-captain respectively. [40] The pair had only expected to hold the positions on an interim basis, but extended into a third series as Atapattu failed to recover in time to tour England in April and ended up filling the roles full-time. [41] In July 2006, Sangakkara made his second-highest Test score to-date (287) against South Africa. In a record-breaking partnership with Mahela Jayawardene, he set up the world record for the highset partnership in Test cricket—624 runs—in this match. [42]
On 6 December 2007 he made it to the top spot of ICC Test player rankings with a rating of 938, the highest rating ever achieved by a Sri Lankan player, and became the first batsman ever to score in excess of 150 in four consecutive tests. [19] His skill was recognised worldwide when he earned selection for the ICC World XI One Day International team that competed against Australia in the Johnnie Walker Series in October 2005. Despite the World XI losing all of the one-day games by considerable margins, Sangakkara left the series with some credit, averaging 46. He was one of the winners of the 2008 inaugural Cricinfo awards for outstanding batting in Test cricket. [43]
Sangakkara holds the record for being the fastest man to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 (jointly held), 11,000 and 12,000 runs in Test cricket. During Sri Lanka's tour to England in May 2006, he was named the vice-captain of the side. On 3 March 2009, a terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team convoy in Pakistan injured 6 Sri Lankan players including Sangakkara. Sangakkara suffered shrapnel wounds in his shoulder. [44] In November 2006, Sangakkara was included in the ICC World XI Test team. Next year, he signed an agreement to join Warwickshire County Cricket Club . [45] That year, he scored back-to-back double centuries in Tests and became only the fifth cricketer in the history to do so. [46]
In February 2009, the then captain of the Sri Lankan side, Mahela Jayawardene announced that he would step down from captaincy "in the best interests of the Sri Lankan team". He said he believed that it would give his successor around two years to build up to the 2011 Cricket World Cup . [50] Therefore, at the age of 31 and with the experience of 80 Tests and 246 ODIs, Sangakkara succeeded Jayawardene as Sri Lanka's captain in all formats of the game. His first engagement in the role was the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 hosted by England in June. [51] Sri Lanka became runners-up in the series after winning all the game in group and knock-out stages and being defeated by Pakistan in the final. Sangakkara made 64 not-out in the final, but was unable to take Sri Lanka for the championship. [52] Sri Lanka failed to reach to the knock-out stage of the ICC Champions Trophy in September 2009. The next Indian tour proved to be disastrous for the team, with Sri Lanka being beaten by India in Test series 2–0 and ODI series 3–1.
Sri Lankan team under the captaincy of Sangakkara gained momentum and won the next Tri-series in Bangladesh , Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka , beating India as well. The Sri Lankans' tour of Australia proved to be very successful, in winning both the T20 and ODI series. This was Sri Lanka's first ever series victory in Australia. [53]
A month in advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the captaincy after the tournament. [54] Sri Lanka reached the final of the tournament. [55] Throughout the tournament Sangakkara was in prolific form with the bat scoring 465 runs from 9 matches and was the third highest run scorer behind team-mate Tillakaratne Dilshan and India's Sachin Tendulkar . Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams. He offered to continue as Test captain if deemed necessary for transition to new skipper, [56] but Dilshan was appointed captain across all formats. [57] Reflecting on the decision afterwards, he said that "captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly ... It's rarely a job you will last long in ... I also had a two-year stint, and I enjoyed it at times, certainly on the field where our results showed we were one of the top two sides in the world for one-and-a-half years, especially in the shorter form of the game." [54]
The same year, he was named the ODI Cricketer of the Year at the ICC awards ceremony . [58] In 2012, he was honoured as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year . [59]

Sri Lanka's first fixture after the World Cup was a Sri Lanka tour of England in 2011 beginning in May. During the second match of a three Test series Tillakaratne Dilshan , Sangakkara's successor as captain, suffered a broken thumb. Sangakkara filled-in while Dilshan was off the pitch and formally assumed the captaincy for the final Test. [60] [61] The match ended in a draw and the series ended in a 1–0 victory for England; Sangakarra scored a century in the match, his first against England in nine Tests. [62]
Sangakkara was named the man of the series in Test series with Pakistan in 2011/12 —his first man of the series award in Test cricket. He made 516 runs in the 3 match series which was won by Pakistan 1–0. [67] On August in 2013, he was named the ODI Cricketer of the Year, wicket keeper-captain of the ICC World XI Test team, and won the ICC People's Choice Award in 2011 ICC Awards . [58] In 2012, he was named one of the Wisden's five Cricketer's of the Year. [59]
Sangakkara struggled when England toured Sri Lanka in 2012. He failed to score a half century during The Two Test match series. But he regained his form in the ODI series against Pakistan where he twice scored in the 90s. In the following Test series Sangakkara continued his form with a 199, the scoreboard originally said he had scored the double century but it turned out to be a mistake. Sri Lanka later won the Test match. He followed this up with 192 in the game, again missing out on the double century. Sri Lanka drew the next two matches meaning Sri Lanka won the series 1–0. The first time they won a Test series since the retirement of Muttiah Muralitharan .
On the Sri Lankan tour of Bangladesh in 2014, Sangakarra hit his highest test score to date with 319 in the first innings of the second test. [68] Making him only the third Sri Lankan player to hit a triple century after Sanath Jayasuria and Mahela Jayawardena . He followed his triple century with a knock of 105 in the 2nd innings as game finished as a draw. He continued his good batting run with another century in the 2nd ODI.
Along with teammate Mahela Jayawardene, he recorded the most partnership runs for the 3rd wicket in Tests, scoring 5890 runs surpassing the 5826 runs of Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar , during the first Test match against Pakistan at Galle International Stadium . The two also hold the record for the highest partnership for any wicket in Test matches, scoring 624 runs for the 3rd wicket against South Africa in July, 2006. [69] This still stands as the largest partnership for any wicket in first-class cricket, anywhere. [70]
His impressive form with the bat continued at the 2014 Asia Cup where he amassed a total of 245 runs in five innings. He started the tournament with a 63 against Pakistan before hitting a match winning 103 against India . He then added scores of 77 and 2 against Afghanistan and Bangladesh before being dismissed for a golden duck in the final against Pakistan. Sri Lanka went on to win the game and the tournament. [71]
Sangakkara decided to retire from T20 internationals after playing the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 . Afterwards Jayawardene also followed him into retirement. Sangakkara under performed in the World T20, but in the final match against India, he scored 51 runs not out off just 33 balls making his team win their second ICC trophy since 1996.
Sri Lanka played their first 7-match ODI series at home, against England from 26 November to 16 December 2014. During the series, on December 3, 2014 he completed 13,000 runs in One-day internationals in the third match of the series at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium , Hambantota , and became the fourth player in one-day history to achieve that feat after Sachin Tendulkar , Ricky Ponting , and Sanath Jayasuriya . He also became the second most prolific half-century maker in One-day internationals during this match. He scored 4 consecutive half-centuries followed by a century in this series. On 13 December 2014, he scored his 20th ODI century, became the second Sri Lankan to score 20 ODI centuries, after 28 by Sanath Jayasuriya, and 9th overall to do so. He also took 4 catches as a wicket-keeper in this match, became the player of the match. [72] This match was his last match in his home town, due to his retirement from ODI arena after 2015 Cricket World Cup .
His last One-Day innings in Sri Lanka was played on 13 December 2014 in the last match of England ODI series. He was caught on 33 in his last innings in home soil. [73]
On 4 January 2015, Sangakkara scored his 38th test century by making 203 against New Zealand during the second match of the 2 test match series. [74] With this feat, he is only one short to become the highest double-century maker in test history. He has 11 test double centuries, only one short of 12 double centuries by Don Bradman . [75] He also surpassed 12,000 runs in test cricket, becoming the first Sri Lankan and 5th overall to achieve that mark. [76]
On 14 February 2015, Sangakkara became the second highest run scorer in One-Day International history, by surpassing Australian Ricky Ponting . He achieved this feat during the first match of 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against New Zealand, but Sri Lanka lost the match. [77]
On 26 February 2015 in 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against Bangladesh, Sangakkara scored his 22nd ODI century in his 400th appearance in One-Day Internationals. The 210* second wicket partnership between Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan on that day was broken again on 1 March 2015, in the next group match in World Cup against England, where Sangakkara joined Lahiru Thirimanne with 212* for the second wicket. Sangakkara scored his 23rd century in this match and this 70 ball century was his fastest century overall and the fastest century by a Sri Lankan in World Cups. [78] [79]
During the same world cup, against Australia, when chasing massive 377 score, Sangakkara passed 14,000 ODI runs, becoming the first Sri Lankan and second overall to pass it. [80] He scored 124 runs in the next match against Scotland , becoming first batsman in World Cup history to score 4 consecutive hundreds. [81]
The last ODI innings of Sangakkara was disappointing from him and his teams' point of view, where Sri Lanka lost the quarter-final against South Africa on 18 March 2015. He only scored 45 runs, where it was Sri Lanka's first World Cup defeat in a quarter final after 1999. His team mate Mahela also retired from ODI career with this match. [82]
Retirement[ edit ]
During the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 championship, Sangakkara announced his retirement from Twenty20 International arena after the championship with his team mate Mahela. Then in 2014 December, he announced he will also retire from ODI cricket after 2015 Cricket World Cup again with Mahela. As he said, he retired from T20I arena on April 2014 and from ODI cricket on 18 March 2015. [83]
On 1 April 2015, Sri Lanka's Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake stated that Sangakkara should reconsider his intention to retire in August 2015. He said that Sangakarra was disillusioned by some of the actions of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in the past, and now that attempts have been made to change personnel and practices, Sangakkara should reconsider his decision. Sangakkara did not gave an answer to the statement. [84]
On 27 June 2015, Sangakkara officially announced his retirement from Test cricket as well. He retired from Test cricket after the second Test match against India . [85] [86] He scored 32 runs in the first innings and 18 in the second of his last test match and got out to Ravichandran Ashwin for the fourth consecutive time in the series. The P Sara Oval ground was decorated with numerous banners and posters of Sangakkara where it said that "Thank You Sanga" and "Class Never Retires". [87] His teammates including Mahela, Thilan Thushara , and Sanath Jayasuriya, Murali came to the ground to farewell Sangakkara. Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation recognized Sangakkara as the "Player of the Century" citing many of Sangakkara's past memories and achievements.
After the conclusion of the second test, a special farewell presentation was held for Sangakkara with the presence of President Maithreepala Sirisena , the Prime minister Ranil Wickramasinghe , former Sri Lankan Test captain Arjuna Ranatunga , former Indian Test captain Sunil Gavaskar , and several cricket celebrities. Several momentous were given for the behalf of his cricket career and Gavaskar invited him to former cricketer's club. [88] [89] Indian captain Virat Kohli described Sangakkara as "a lovely person". [90] President Sirisena offered him to work as the Commissioner for United Kingdom in Sri Lanka stating "He has been a great face for our country and it gives me immense pleasure in offering him the post of High Commissioner to the UK". [91]
Cowdrey Lecture[ edit ]
Sangakkara delivered the 2011 MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lords . [92] He became the youngest person and the first current international player to deliver that lecture, which was widely praised by the cricketing community. [13] [14] [93] The one-hour-long speech was based on the history and the corruption in the cricket administration in Sri Lanka. In his speech, he said: "accountability and transparency in administration and credibility of conduct were lost in a mad power struggle that would leave Sri Lankan cricket with no clear, consistent administration", and observed that these problems in administration had risen only after Sri Lanka's 1996 Cricket World Cup victory. [94] He also blamed "a handful of well-meaning individuals" who control the game, wasting the cricket board 's finances and resources. Immediately after the lecture, the Sri Lankan sports minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage ordered an investigation into the speech. [95] Despite the critical comments by the Sri Lankan government officials, it has been described as "the most important speech in cricket history". [96]
Beyond Cricket[ edit ]
After his retirement from ODI cricket in 2015, Sangakkara became the Leading Wisden Cricketer of the year 2014 for his impressive cricket career. With this award, he was second only to Indian Virender Sehwag , to win the Wisden Leading cricketer award twice, both in 2011 and 2015. He also won the award for Outstanding Contribution to Sport at the 5th Asian Awards, which were held in London on 17 April 2015. [97]
On 19 August 2015, just after the end of Sri Lankan Parliamentary election of 2015 , president Maithripala Sirisena appointed Sangakkara as the Ambassador Of Anti-narcotics program In Sri Lanka. [98] The letter of appointment was handed over to Sangakkara by the president at President’s official residence. [99] [100] [101]
County cricket[ edit ]
Sangakkara has played English county cricket with Warwickshire in the 2007 County Championship . In 2010 Sangakkara was contracted to represent Lancashire in the 2010 County Championship , [102] but never represented the club because of international commitments. [103] For the 2015 and 2016 seasons Sangakkara has contracted to play for Surrey . [104]
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
Sangakkara has played in five seasons of the Indian Premier League . Winning bids for him in 2008 and 2011 were US$700,000 by Kings XI Punjab and US$300,000 by Deccan Chargers respectively. He was the captain of the Sunrisers Hyderabad team. Sangakkara has scored 1567 runs with 10 half-centuries in 62 matches in IPL. [105]
Sri Lanka Premier League[ edit ]
In the Sri Lanka Premier League which officially started in 2012, Sangakkara was named the captain and icon player of the Kandurata Warriors franchise. Unfortunately he couldn't participate as a player in the inaugural edition in 2012 as he suffered a finger injury weeks before the tournament during a One Day International against India. However, he appeared as a television commentator during some matches.
Caribbean Premier League[ edit ]
Return to county cricket[ edit ]
Before Sri Lanka's test series against England in 2014, Sangakkara returned to county cricket, playing two matches for Durham , [107] which included 159 against Sussex in his final innings. On 16 January 2015, it was announced that he would be joining Surrey on a two-year contract. [108] Sangakkara scored a brilliant century against over 152 kilometres per hour (94 mph). [45] Such occurrences were not the norm as his pace dropped to around 130 km/h (81 mph), but under Eric Simons (who was India's bowling coach from 2010 to 2012) Sharma was regularly bowling in excess of 140 km/h (87 mph) when India toured Australia in 2011/12. [46] [47] According to India's former bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad he is amongst the most dedicated bowler in India's set up. [48]
Simons noted height was a factor in the length Sharma bowled, saying "For Ishant to hit the stumps, he has to pitch it fuller, and that means the batsman has more chance of keeping it out". [47] Former West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh identified two problems with Sharma's bowling action : his head drops when the ball is delivered and the position of his wrist varies. The first takes some of the speed out of the delivery, while the second reduces the chance of the ball seaming and swinging . The former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar suggested that the lack of movement in Sharma's bowling discouraged him from pitching the ball up so instead he tends to bowl short . The slower pace of his bowling when he pitches the ball up may explain why the yorker is not an effective delivery for him. Manjrekar went further, saying that "for all his talent and commitment he just does not take enough wickets"; when the remark was made in January 2012, Sharma had a bowling average of nearly 37 from 43 Tests. [49]

Brett Lee (born 8 November 1976) is a former Australian international cricketer and a Channel Nine cricket commentator. During his international career, Lee was recognised as one of the fastest bowlers in the world of cricket. In each of his first two years, he averaged less than 20 with the ball, but since then has mostly achieved figures in the early 30s. [1] He was also known as an athletic fielder and useful lower-order batsman , with a batting average exceeding 20 in Test cricket. Lee finished his Test with 310 wickets, and his One Day International career with 380 wickets.
Lee featured in the Australian teams that won the 2003 and 2007 World Cups . He announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket in January 2012, having played his first Test in 1999. He subsequently declined to renew his contract with his home state side New South Wales , but continued to play Twenty20 matches for several seasons after, most notably in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Big Bash League . [2] [3] In January 2015, Lee announced his retirement from all forms of the game, effective at the end of the 2014–15 Big Bash League season . [4]
Style[ edit ]
Lee was known for his pace and regularly clocked 90 mph and above. He ranks only behind Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar (161.3 km/h, 100.2 mph) as the fastest bowler in contemporary cricket during most of the 2000s. [5] The strain of consistently bowling at 150 km/h caused a string of stress fractures and recurring injuries and forced him to alter his strategy, which he has done effectively. [6] Rather than relying on pace alone, he uses a wide array of deliveries aimed at wearing down the batsman, although he has been known to bowl entire overs above the 150 km/h mark. His fastest ball was clocked at 160.8 km/h (99.9 mph) against New Zealand in 2005. In a match against West Indies in 2000/01 he was clocked at 161.8 km/h (100.5 mph), but it was not an official match and therefore not recognised by the ICC .
Early in his career, Lee was reported for a suspected illegal bowling action, but was cleared, [7] and was also heavily criticised after bowling a series of beamers at batsmen during a number of ODIs in 2005. Captain Ricky Ponting defended Lee saying that it was not intentional. [8] [9] His slower balls also has dramatic falls of pace with varying length, often from a cutter grip, where it can go as slow as 100 km/h (60 mph), but it hovers on average around the 115 km/h-130 km/h range. He is also known to celebrate many bowled wickets with a chainsaw celebration.
Batting[ edit ]
Lee was a competent lower-order batsman. Together with Mike Hussey , he has held the record for highest 7th wicket partnership for Australia in ODIs since 2005–06 with 123. [10]
During the 2005 Ashes series, Lee had numerous defiant innings, including a stand of 43 not out in the Second Test at Edgbaston , Australia's highest individual score in that innings. This innings nearly won the match for Australia but the other batsman Michael Kasprowicz was caught behind by Geraint Jones and England won by just two runs. After the memorable match, England bowlers Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff went over to console Lee. The image of Flintoff consoling Lee was a moment which came to symbolise a hotly contested series. [11]
On 2 April 2006, Lee hit his highest Test score of 64 in 68 balls against South Africa at Johannesburg . His previous highest score in Tests was 62 not out which he made against the West Indies in 2000 at the Gabba . Lee nearly surpassed this score on 3 January 2008 against India when he made 59 off 121 balls. Lee had also once again nearly surpassed his highest test score when he had made 63 not out, but unfortunately Ricky Ponting had declared the innings in the 2nd test against the West Indies. As a result of this, he fell one run short of his highest test score.
Early career[ edit ]
Lee started playing in the junior teams of his local side, Oak Flats Rats, and gradually worked his way up the ranks. At 16 he began playing first grade cricket for Campbelltown , where he managed to claim the wickets of a few New South Wales cricketers, and Mosman , [12] where at one point, he shared the new ball with Shoaib Akhtar and briefly played alongside England batsman Andrew Strauss . [13] [14]
Lee was called up to the Australian Under 17 & 19 teams. In March 1994, he was forced out of the Australian under-19 team to tour India due to stress fractures in his lower back and it forced him to remodel his bowling action to minimise the impact on his back. He was awarded a scholarship to attend the AIS Australian Cricket Academy in the 1995–96 season. [15] His contemporaries included fellow internationals Jason Gillespie and Mike Hussey . [16]
Prior to making his first-class debut, Lee played for Mosman in the final of the 1996–97 Sydney Grade Cricket competition. [17]
Domestic career[ edit ]
Lee was first named in the New South Wales Blues squad as the twelfth man for the 14–16 November match against Queensland in the 1997–98 Sheffield Shield . [18] The following week, he made his first-class debut for the Blues against Western Australia and took 3 wickets at 114, including that of the captain Tom Moody . [19] It would be his only appearance in the Sheffield Shield for the rest of the season. [20] He ended a memorable month by taking a 5-wicket haul in the Sydney grade Limited-Overs Cup final against Bankstown on 30 November. [21]
During the 1998–99 season Lee was a more regular presence in the latter stages of the Sheffield Shield. He took 14 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul against Tasmania in the second innings. [22] He started the 1999–2000 season by claiming 8 wickets in his first two matches. Such performances impressed his New South Wales teammate Steve Waugh , who was then Australia captain, and culminated in his Test debut in December 1999. He finished the season as the Blues' second-highest wicket taker in the Pura Cup with 24 wickets in 5 matches. [23] [24]
After a successful Test series against India, Lee returned to domestic cricket and was named in the 2008 Pura Cup final . [25] He hit his career best batting score, 97 against Victoria in the Blues' second innings and scored a record 176-run partnership with Beau Casson . [26] [27] In Victoria's second innings, he took 4–72, dismissing the last four tailenders , as the Blues won the final.
In 2009 he battled back from injury and was a key player in New South Wales' success during the Champions League Twenty20 . During the final he played an important part with both bat and ball and was named Man of the Match. [28] [29] He also won the Man of the Series award. [30]
Following his retirement from Test cricket, Lee stopped playing first-class cricket to concentrate on the limited-overs formats. He was the Blues' highest wicket-taker in the 2010–11 Ryobi One-Day Cup with 15 wickets and had the second best economy rate of the top five wicket-takers despite missing the latter stages of the campaign due to international duty.
In June 2012 he declined to renew his contract with the Blues, ending his 15-year association with his domestic team. [31]
He retired from Big Bash League after playing the final match for the Sydney Sixers on 28 January 2015. [32] In his last over, he took two wickets of successive deliveries, however, his hat-trick ball did not result in a run out in what was to be the final ball of the match, which Sydney Sixers lost by a run. [33]
International career[ edit ]
One month after making his first class debut, Lee was chosen to represent the Australian A team on a tour to South Africa. He claimed two wickets but in that very match, stress fractures in his back from the previous injury had re-opened and Lee was in a back brace for over three months.
Test career[ edit ]
By the late 1990s there were calls for Lee to be included in the national squad. Captain Steve Waugh , who also played with him for New South Wales , was impressed by Lee's debut and pushed for his inclusion into the national team. He was eventually chosen in the final 14 for the Test series against Pakistan in 1999 but failed to make the starting 11. By the time the Test series against India came around, he was twelfth man . However, he duly made his Test debut for Australia in December 1999 against the touring Indians , becoming Australia's 383rd Test cricketer.
Bowling first change, Lee took a wicket in his first over in Test cricket when he bowled Sadagoppan Ramesh with his fourth delivery. He also captured Rahul Dravid in his first spell before returning to take three wickets in six balls to finish the innings with figures of 5/47 from 17 overs, becoming the first Australian fast bowler since Dennis Lillee to take 5 wickets on debut. [34] [35] Lee took thirteen wickets in his opening two Tests at the low average of 14.15.
Lee won the inaugural Donald Bradman Young Player of the Year Award at the Allan Border Medal award ceremony in 2000 soon after his debut.
Lee took 42 wickets in his opening three series, the most by any Australian bowler in the seven matches he played. [36] He was selected for the Test series against the West Indies in late 2000. During the first Test he scored his first half- century in test cricket and in the next Test, took seven wickets including a five wicket haul in the second innings. [37] However, he suffered a stress fracture of the lower back which kept him out of the next three Tests. He returned against Zimbabwe but soon suffered another setback a month later when he broke his right elbow and was sidelined until May 2001.[ citation needed ]
Return from injury[ edit ]
Lee returned to the international team for the 2001 Ashes series after recovering from an elbow injury. His comeback saw less success than his debut, managing only nine wickets in five Tests at 55.11. However, Lee was back as Australia's leading wicket-taker in the first and third Test against New Zealand later that year, in a series which he captured 5 wickets in the second innings and made a contribution of 61 with the bat in the first Test match. The series ended in a 0–0 draw. He finished the series with 14 wickets at 25.14. The two home and away series against South Africa were not as productive, yielding 19 wickets in six Tests at 38.42.
Lee only took five wickets in a match on three occasions between the New Zealand series and the 2003 Cricket World Cup . Lee came under pressure for his position after taking only five wickets at 46.50 in the three-Test series against Pakistan in 2002. Andy Bichel , who was filling for the injured Jason Gillespie , took eight wickets at 13.25. With the other frontline bowlers all taking wickets at less than 13, [38] Lee was dropped when Gillespie returned for the first two Tests during the 2002–03 Ashes series. He returned for the Perth Test, after claiming a five wicket haul in a Pura Cup match against Queensland for New South Wales . He took thirteen wickets at 41.23 in three matches, compared to Bichel's ten at 35.1. [39] After the 2003 Cricket World Cup , Lee took 17 wickets at 28.88 in four Tests against the West Indies. It was the first series in two years where he averaged under 30, and only the second in that period where had averaged under 40.
After a mid year break, he participated in a Two Test series against Bangladesh in northern Australia. He took six wickets at 31.66, and was Australia's most expensive bowler, with the other specialist bowlers averaging 15.55 against the lowest ranked team in Test cricket. He followed this with six wickets at 37 in a comfortable 2–0 Test series against Zimbabwe, in which the other specialist bowlers averaged 23.15. [40]
Against the Indian batting line-up in the 2003–04 home series, which ended in a 1–1 draw for Australia, Lee was out of the first two Tests recovering from a torn abdominal muscle, an injury which he sustained during the Zimbabwe series. [41]
Loss of Test position[ edit ]
Lee took eight wickets in 100 overs in the final two Tests against India, at an average of 59.50. This Test included a double century to Sachin Tendulkar in the Indians' first innings of 7/705 where Sachin and V.V.S. Laxman freely attacked Lee and other bowlers in the final Test in Sydney. He ended the series with the worst average and economy rate of Australia's front line bowlers. [42]
He was subsequently replaced by fellow fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz in 2004 during the tour of Sri Lanka when Lee's ankle injury worsened, forcing him to return home to have surgery. This injury would force Lee out of the game for 4½ months to ensure his full recovery. Lee's form in the Test arena had been ineffective, and from July 2001 to January 2004, he had a Test bowling average of 38.42, [43] compared to an average of 16.07 in his earlier career.
Lee was unable to reclaim his position for eighteen months, when Kasprowicz took 47 wickets at 23.74 in thirteen Tests, taking his wickets at a much lower cost than Lee had done in the previous three years. This included 17 wickets at 26.82 on the spin friendly pitches of the Indian subcontinent, helping Australia to its first whitewash in Sri Lanka, and its first series win in India for 35 years. [44]
Brett Lee bowling against South Africa at the WACA in 2005
After 18 months on the sidelines, Lee returned to the Test team in the 2005 Ashes series. With Kasprowicz and Jason Gillespie both struggling for form, Lee returned to take the new ball with Glenn McGrath . He averaged 40 with the ball for the series, which some commentators have put down to having to bowl longer spells than he was accustomed to at the time[ citation needed ], but was retained, in part because of his defiant batting[ citation needed ] which yielded runs at an average of 26.33. During the Ashes, he claimed his 150th test wicket off Andrew Strauss with a straight yorker on Day 1 of the third test.
Part of Lee's difficulty at Test level is that the benefits of his high speed, which give the batsmen less reaction time, also results in more erratic bowling. In recent times he has tried to concentrate solely on accuracy by reducing speed. During the first Test against the West Indies in late 2005 at the Gabba , after declaring that he would sacrifice pace and focus on 'line and length', [45] Lee reverted to his initial style of bowling, based on the advice of his captain Ricky Ponting after his new method of bowling failed in the first innings. [46] This saw him take 5/30 his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests, his first in four years.
In the 2005-06 Australian cricket season , Lee's Test figures improved from his 2001–04 difficulties, with a season bowling average of 25.74.
During South Africa's 2005–06 tour of Australia, Lee's form saw a steady improvement, with figures of 5/93 in the first Test at Perth . He finished the three Test series with 13 wickets and of the Australian bowlers, was second only to Shane Warne 's 14 wickets in the series. Three Australian players including Lee, who was reprimanded in the Third Test in Sydney for showing dissent towards umpire Aleem Dar . [47]
With the unavailability of Glenn McGrath for the tour of South Africa in March–April 2006, Lee became the spearhead of the Australian bowling line-up. [48] In the second Test of that series, at Durban , Lee captured his 200th Test wicket in his 51st match and also captured figures of 5 for 69, on the back of 49 Test wickets in 2005. [49] He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year . He was unable to maintain his performance when Australia visited Bangladesh for a two Test series, taking two wickets at 93, coming bottom of Australia's bowling averages. [50]
In the first three tests of the 2006–07 Ashes series , he only took eight wickets and was fined for excessive appealing in the Third Test in Adelaide when a LBW decision was not in his favour. [47] However, during the week period between the Adelaide and Melbourne tests, he worked with Troy Cooley , Australia's bowling coach, to adjust his run up and came back in the 4th and final tests with more wickets. He finished the series 20 wickets, with his best bowling figures being 4 for 47 at an average of 33.20, including 6 in the final test. His tally was only bettered by his teammates Stuart Clark , Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath as the quartet claimed more wickets than the entire England bowling attack combined. [51]
Post McGrath-Warne era[ edit ]
Following the retirements of Warne and McGrath, Lee rose to the challenge and was awarded the Man of the Series in the inaugural Warne-Muralidaran Trophy , a two-Test series against Sri Lanka in late-2007. In his first series as bowling spearhead reaped 16 wickets at an average of 17.5. This was achieved by bowling 5 km/h slower to improve accuracy. In the following series Lee took 24 wickets at 22.58 in four Tests against India. In this series he overtook Jason Gillespie to become Australia's 5th highest wicket taker. His consistent efforts saw him rewarded with the Man of the Series Award for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , 2007–08. He capped off the season by winning the Allan Border Medal , the award given to the player adjudged Australia's best international cricketer of the past year.
Lee seemed underdone in the 2008 Australian tour of the West Indies, taking only 5 wickets in the first Test match, during which he seemed exhausted. He returned to productivity, taking eight wickets in the Second test, including a 5 wicket haul, and 6 in the Third Test.
During the Indian tour, Lee picked up a stomach virus and was unable to find his best form throughout the series. Lee showed glimpses of his best form[ citation needed ] when the team returned to Australia for a two test series with New Zealand, but generally seemed down on pace. However, he struggled in the two tests he played of the series with South Africa, which Australia lost 2–1, likely due to a niggling ankle injury and then a stress fracture he developed during the series (both in his left foot). The fracture broke completely during the second innings of the Boxing Day Test-match and he was forced to return home for surgery.
By the time he returned to the Australian team for the Ashes in 2009, his position as spearhead had been usurped by the left armer Mitchell Johnson . Additionally, the arrival of bowlers like Peter Siddle , Ben Hilfenhaus and Doug Bollinger ensured that Lee had to fight for a position in the team. However, he took six wickets in the first innings against the England Lions team in a practice match leading up to the Ashes. Lee was the only bowler to get reverse swing in this match and appeared to be in line for selection for the First Test at Cardiff. However, he picked up a left side strain and a sore rib in this match and he was ruled out of the first three Tests. He was then overlooked for a recall and never played test cricket again, announcing his retirement from test cricket at the beginning of 2010.
Retirement[ edit ]
Lee had been considering retiring from Test cricket for some time since 2008 due to the physical strain. In February 2010, he announced his retirement from Test cricket after consulting friend and England rival Andrew Flintoff , stating that bowling "at 150km/h for five days is very hard on the body". [11] [52] He had been out with a string of injuries and had not played a Test since December 2008. He ended his Test career with 310 wickets in 76 tests, the fourth highest Australian total behind Shane Warne , Glenn McGrath and Dennis Lillee .
Lee bowling against Pakistan at Lord's , 2004-09-04
Lee made his One Day International debut for Australia against Pakistan on 9 January 2000 during the Carlton and United Breweries Series at the Gabba , Brisbane . He became the 140th ODI cricketer to represent Australia. In February 2002 against South Africa , he scored his first ODI half century , 51* not out.
In One-day Internationals, he was ranked by the ICC as the No. 1 ODI bowler in January 2006 [53] and has been ranked among the top ten ODI bowlers since the start of 2003. His bowling strike rate of around 30 puts him amongst the most incisive in this form of the game. He also has a One-day International hat-trick to his name, achieved in the 2003 World Cup against Kenya . Lee was the first Australian and fourth bowler to ever achieve this feat in World Cup history.
In the matches Australia played in the 2005–06 triangular one day series , Lee gave a display of his useful batting abilities by making 57 in the second game in a 100 run partnership with Michael Hussey to pull Australia out of a middle order collapse. Lee finished the series with 15 wickets, the third highest tally behind Nathan Bracken and Muttiah Muralitharan .
His bowler-fielder partnership with long-time international teammate and wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist yielded 58 wickets in 151 matches, the fourth highest of all time in ODI history. [54]
2003 World Cup[ edit ]
With main bowler Shane Warne banned from the 2003 World Cup the day before the opening match, Lee moved up the pecking order and, together with Andy Bichel and Glenn McGrath , formed one of the tournament's most lethal attacks, claiming 59 wickets between them. Lee concluded the tournament with 22 wickets off 83.1 overs at an average of 17.90, a wicket behind Sri Lankan left-arm fastbowler Chaminda Vaas . Lee also had a third leading strike-rate of 22.68 behind West Indian fast bowler Vasbert Drakes and Australian counterpart Andrew Bichel who topped the strike-rates with 19.43 and 21.37 respectively. He also reached the 160 km/h mark twice; his delivery to Marvan Atapattu in the semi-final of the reached 160.1 km/h (99.5 mph) [55] and hit 160.7 km/h in his first over against England in the group stage. [56]
Lee earned six of his 22 wickets during the group stage, 11 wickets during the Super-six stage, 3 from the semi-final and 2 wickets from the final which Australia won. He took one five-wicket haul, 5 for 42, against Trans- Tasman rivals New Zealand during their super-six encounter at Port Elizabeth to put Australia ahead after a dismal innings. [57] He also earned his first international hat trick with figures of 3 for 14 against Kenya during the last match of the super-six stage. [58]
Comeback[ edit ]
After having to return home due to injury during the 2007 World Cup , Lee traveled with the squad to England for the 2009 "English summer" tour . He was left out of the test side during the Ashes but was in the one-day side for the NatWest Series in September. He was the highest wicket-taker for Australia with 12 and also took his ninth five-wicket haul in ODIs as Australia made a clean sweep winning all except one match in the series. [59] With that five-wicket haul, he became the first person to take two five-wicket hauls in ODIs at Lord's ; the ball used is now on display at Lord's MCC Museum. [60] Later that month he was a part of the successful 2009 ICC Champions Trophy squad and was level on 6 wickets with teammates Peter Siddle and Shane Watson , the highest total for the Australian team. Injuries sustained in test matches forced him out until 2011, having not played for Australia for almost two years. In the subsequent ODI series, his return was more successful. He finished as the leading wicket-taker for the series with 11 scalps at 24.00, his series best figures of 3/27 coming in the third match at the SCG . His pace was consistently around the mid 140s km/h and on occasion he once again managed to break the 150 km/h mark.[ citation needed ].
Despite competition from younger bowlers and another injury setback, Lee managed to make the squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup . He finished the tournament with 13 wickets, the highest of all the bowlers in the team. Of the 13 wickets, 4 came in the match against Pakistan but it was not enough as Australia lost the match and eventually crashed out at the quarterfinals to rivals India .
Against the West Indies in March 2012 he hit his highest score, 59 before getting caught off a ball by Kemar Roach . His final ODIs were during the 2012 tour of England and Ireland . During the match against Ireland he opened the bowling and bowled William Porterfield and Ed Joyce in only his first three deliveries. [24] [61] [62]
Retirement[ edit ]
Upon his retirement form international cricket, Lee had played in 76 Tests, 221 ODIs and 25 T20Is, and had equalled Glenn McGrath's run of 380 wickets in ODI matches – the highest for Australia. [2] [3] [63] [64]
Twenty20[ edit ]
Lee made his Twenty20 and T20 International debut on 15 February 2005 against New Zealand in the first ever T20 international match. [66] He was called up to the squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 . During the tournament, he made history by claiming the first hat trick in T20 internationals in the Group F match against Bangladesh and also won the Man of the Match award. [67]
Coaching career[ edit ]

Personal life[ edit ]
Lee is the second of three sons born to Bob, a metallurgist , and Helen (née Buxton), a piano teacher, and grew up in the Wollongong suburbs of Oak Flats and Mount Warrigal . [16] His older brother Shane is a retired all rounder and former international and younger brother Grant previously played cricket for New South Wales U-19, and is now an accountant.[ citation needed ] Lee attended Balarang Public School and Oak Flats High School, which later named its cricket ground in his honour. The brothers first played cricket together in front of their house using a tennis ball and the garage door as the " wicket-keeper ". [79] As a child he idolised Allan Donald and Dennis Lillee , the latter of whom would become a mentor to him as a teenager. [16] Lee has been known by his nickname 'Binga', after the chain of electronics store Bing Lee , since his high school days. [16] He was once briefly nicknamed 'Oswald' by former Australian captain and New South Wales teammate Steve Waugh during his early international career. During an ODI around 2000, he was in the batting order behind his brother Shane and Ian Harvey . When Waugh read out the batting order, instead of reading "Lee, Harvey, Lee", he read out "Lee, Harvey, Oswald" ( Lee Harvey Oswald ). [80]
Lee married Elizabeth Kemp in June 2006. They have a son named Preston Charles, born 16 November 2006. However, after two years of marriage, on 21 August 2008, Lee confirmed his separation from Kemp. [81] They divorced in 2009. At the time of the split, media speculation cited Kemp was having an affair with a rugby player in Brisbane; however, this was later disputed, with extended periods of loneliness due to Lee's off-season commitments keeping him away from Kemp and his young son Preston given as the reason for the marriage breakdown. [82]
Lee is part of the rock band Six & Out . The band is made up of his brother Shane and former New South Wales cricketers Brad McNamara , Gavin Robertson and Richard Chee Quee . Lee plays the bass guitar or acoustic guitar for the band. [83]

The song reached a peak position of number two on the Indian and South African charts. [84] In 2008, he filmed scenes for his first Bollywood movie Victory . [85] [86]
In November 2011, Lee launched his autobiography, which he wrote with the help of author James Knight. [87] [88]
In September 2013, Lee tweeted his support for Tony Abbott , leader of the Liberal Party of Australia in the Australian federal election 2013 . [89]
Endorsements[ edit ]
Lee's sponsorship deals include the breakfast cereal Weet-Bix (which at one time were marketed as "Brett-Bix"), [90] Gatorade and Volkswagen , of which Lee has two vehicles. [91]

Owing to Lee's popularity in India, [92] he has a number of major sponsorship deals there, including for Timex watches, New Balance shoes,Glamorgan , where he scored 149 runs, which was his maiden century for Surrey in this county season. After the match, he said that he is willing to see the comeback of English batsman Kevin Pietersen to the international cricket [109] [110]
Personal life[ edit ]
Sangakkara is married to his longtime partner, Yehali. [111] They have twins, a girl and a boy: Swyree and Kavith. [112]
He is involved in a number of charity work in Sri Lanka. He is a member of the Think Wise Initiative, launched by International Cricket Council , Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and UNICEF , which is aimed at raising awareness of HIV prevention and eliminating discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS . [113] He is also a partner of the Foundation of Goodness, a charity launched by Muttiah Muralitharan . [25]
Playing style[ edit ]
Sangakkara is a left-handed top order batsman who likes to hit the ball square of the wicket on the off-side. While the cut and the pull are natural strokes to him, he tends to play off the front foot. The cover drive is one of his regular scoring shots. Sangakkara averages 58.66 in Test cricket. In ODI cricket, he retired with an average of 42. [114] Sangakkara handed over his wicket-keeping duty to Prasanna Jayawardene in Tests cricket in 2006. He played as a specialist batsman in Tests, and retired as a wicket keeper-batsman in other formats of the game. He is the first in the list of wicket keepers who contributed to the most number of dismissals in ODI cricket, With 499. He is also the wicket keeper with highest number of stumpings—99—in ODI cricket. [115]
He has won a certain degree of admiration for his clever use of sledging and is one of few cricketers who are willing to talk about it openly. In an interview in 2004 he explained his approach to sledging:
The public perception of sledging is to go out there and abuse someone in obscene language, questioning their parentage or sexual preferences. That kind of abuse does not belong on the field of play. Sledging, as coined and pioneered by the Australians, is a measured comment designed to get a reaction out of a player. It could be any reaction: a bit of anger, a show of arrogance, a comment, a shake of the head, or a slump of the shoulders.

; born 1 November 1974), commonly known as V. V. S. Laxman, is a former Indian cricketer. [1] Laxman represented Hyderabad in domestic cricket and played for Lancashire in English county cricket . He was the captain of the Deccan Chargers team in the Indian Premier League in its first year [2] before being replaced by Adam Gilchrist for the next year. [3] In 2011, Laxman was awarded the Padma Shri award, India's fourth highest civilian award from the Government of India . [4]
Laxman bats right-handed and occasionally bowls off-spin. He is noted for his superb timing and the ability to hit against the spin, reminiscent of his role model Mohammed Azharuddin . Laxman is particularly noted for the skilful use of his supple wrists, which allow him to flick the ball to various places, but usually through the leg side. This also helps in his catching, and he typically fields in the slips or in a bat pad position.
Laxman is noted most for his batting against Australia , in both Tests and One Day Internationals . Six out of his 17 Test hundreds, and four out of his six ODI hundreds have come against Australia. [5] [6] He has two double-centuries in Tests, both of them against Australia: his personal best of 281 at Kolkata in 2000–01, and 200 not out at Feroz Shah Kotla in 2008–09, [7] and in 2002 he was named one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year . In 2012, Laxman retired from international cricket. [8]
Personal life[ edit ]
Laxman was born in Hyderabad in Telangana . [9] [10] Laxman's parents are, noted Physicians Dr. Shantaram and Dr. Satyabhama of Vijayawda-Guntur. [11] Laxman studied at Little Flower High School , Hyderabad . He then enrolled as a medical student but chose cricket as a career over medicine. He was awarded an honorary doctorate degree on 4 February 2015 by Teri University , New Delhi . [12] [13]
He married G. R. Shailaja from Guntur , who is a post-graduate in computer applications on 16 February 2004. [11] They have two children – a son, Sarvajit and a daughter, Achinthya.
Philanthrophy[ edit ]
Recently he attended Food for Change along with Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Pulela Gopichand for the charity event of educating 2 lakh students.
Playing style[ edit ]
Laxman is known for his "wristy, willowy and sinuous" style, one which is technically fluid at its best. Laxman's on-side playing capability is comparable with his fellow Hyderabadi Mohammed Azharuddin 's. The Australians once admitted that they did not know where to bowl to him. [14] Laxman is widely criticised as a slow runner between the wickets and he is one of the few players who have played 100 Tests but have never played in the Cricket World Cup . Despite being a slow runner between wickets, Laxman could score rapidly as he was such a fine stroke player and could play freely for long periods of time.
VVS Laxman with his family at Teri University , receiving the doctoral degree.
Technically sound, Laxman stands tall and still at the crease, with a keen awareness of the off-stump and a polished ability to dispatch the bad ball. He plays with a high elbow and a steady stance and a textbook technique with natural elegance and flair. At the start of his career, Laxman was rated by Geoffrey Boycott as one of India's best current players of the hard (new) ball. Indian selectors also thought on those lines and asked Laxman to open on a number of occasions. But Laxman came into his own only when he was asked to bat in the middle order. Laxman has played some of his best match-winning innings while playing at no. 3, no. 5 and no. 6. His score of 281 against Australia rang in a new era of Indian dominance which culminated in India gaining the no. 1 spot in test cricket a few years later. His 281 is rated by many as the best ever innings played by an Indian batsman. He made that score while batting at number 3, having been moved up the order from no. 6 for the second innings of the test match.
Youth career[ edit ]
Laxman made his Under-19 debut for India against Australia in February 1994. [15] Batting at six, he made 88 in his debut innings against a bowling attack that consisted of Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie , both of who were making their debuts too. [16] In the second game of the series, Laxman scored an unbeaten 151 in the first innings and 77 in the second innings to help his team register a 226-run victory. [17] He continued his good form as he scored 36 and 84 in the third game to end up as the leading run-scorer of the series. [18] The Test series was followed by a 3-match ODI series, where he managed scores of 24, 22 and 77. [19] [20] [21] Later in August that year, the India Under-19 team toured England for 2 ODIs and 3 Test matches. [22] Laxman disappointed in the ODIs with scores of 20 and 5. [23] [24] However, in the first Test he struck 119 in the first innings, but did not get to bat in the second innings as India cruised to a 9-wicket win. [25] He made only 28 in the second match and 4 in the third. [26] [27]
Domestic cricket[ edit ]
Laxman made his first-class debut for Hyderabad against Punjab in the quarter-final match of 1992–93 Ranji Trophy season. He scored a duck in the first innings and 17 in the second. [28] He played only one match for Hyderabad in the next season, before getting dropped. [29] However, he was named in the South Zone squad for the 1994/95 Duleep Trophy in the back of his impressive outings for India Under-19s, but he failed to score big in the tournament. In the following Ranji Trophy season, Laxman notched up 532 runs from five matches at an average of 76 scoring two centuries. [30] In the semi-final of the Duleep Trophy of 1995/96 season against West Zone , Laxman scored 47 in the first innings and a spectacular 121 in the second innings, sharing a 199-run partnership with skipper Rahul Dravid . [31] He had another brilliant Ranji season the next year, as he piled 775 runs in just 11 innings at an average of 86 with 3 centuries [32] and a best of 203* that came against Karnataka in the semi-final, which Hyderabad eventually lost. [33] He was picked to play for Rest of India against Karnataka in Irani Cup and also in the Board President's XI squad against the touring Australian team. [34] He played only three matches in 1996/97 Ranji season, where he scored three half-centuries, [35] before getting picked for the Indian Test team against South Africa . [36]
Early international career (1996–2000)[ edit ]
Laxman made his Test debut in 1996 against South Africa at Ahmedabad , scoring a fifty in the second innings of the match. [37] In the second game at Kolkata , he scored 14 and 1. [38] He played just one Test in the South African tour the following month and was unable to cement his place in a star-studded Indian middle order. Instead, he was asked to open the innings, starting in West Indies in 1997. At Kingston , he scored 64 in his first innings as opener. [39] However, he averaged only 28 in that series playing as an opener. [40] But intermittently continued in this role for nearly three years, but without any consistent success. In 1998 at Calcutta , he scored 95 against Australia opening the innings with Navjot Sidhu who scored 97. [41] India went on to win the match by an innings and 219 runs. Though he was selected in the Test squad that toured New Zealand in 1998, he did not get to play a single game as Ajay Jadeja was preferred over Laxman to open the innings with Sidhu. [42] Laxman scored a duck on his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in the Pepsi Tri-Series in 1998. [43] He had a horrible run in the ODIs in 1998 which resulted in him getting dropped from the ODI team for more than a year. Against Pakistan in 1999, he scored just 66 runs from two Tests, averaging a modest 16. [44] In the first match of the Asian Test Championship later that year, Laxman scored 67 against Pakistan, but failed to score consistently, before getting dropped from the Test team as well. [45]
Laxman returned to playing first-class cricket in 1999 to regain his place in the national team. In the 1999–2000 season of Ranji Trophy, he broke the record for most runs in a Ranji season when he made 1415 runs, at an average of 108, in just 9 matches notching up eight hundreds – a record that still remains intact. His performance was rewarded when, in January 2000, he was recalled in the Indian squad for the Australian tour. He scored 167 in the third and final Test match at Sydney when the rest of the batsmen struggled to cope with Glenn McGrath 's destructive bowling, [46] a rare high point for India in an otherwise disastrous tour. Despite this success against an attack containing both McGrath and Shane Warne , Laxman apparently decided that he would return to domestic cricket, rather than continue playing as opener, a role which he believed did not suit him. As a result, Laxman was out of the Test team for nearly a year. He was recalled in late 2000, and also found a spot in the side for the home series against Australia in 2001.
Australia's tour of India (2001)[ edit ]
Laxman's career changed dramatically in the home series against Australia . In the first Test at Mumbai , Laxman made 20 and 12, as the entire Indian batting line-up, with the exception of Sachin Tendulkar , capitulated, leading to a 10-wicket defeat. [47] This was Australia's 16th consecutive Test win and extended their own world record. [48] In the next Test, however, after scoring 59 in the first innings, Laxman shot to fame with an extraordinary knock of 281 in the second innings (following on) against Australia at the Eden Gardens , when under tremendous pressure and with Australia looking set for a crushing 17th win in a row. [49] He broke Sunil Gavaskar 's long standing Indian Test record score of 236*. [50] This remained the highest ever by an Indian until it was eclipsed by Virender Sehwag 's triple ton against Pakistan in Multan in March 2004. [51] The innings also contributed to a record partnership of 376 with Rahul Dravid who made 180 and together they survived the whole 4th day. Laxman's performance was of enormous consequence: India had been on the brink of an innings defeat but went on to win the Test and the series, denying Steve Waugh 's conquest of the "final frontier". This was only the third time in the history of cricket that a team had managed to win a Test after being forced to follow on. [52] It has become one of the most celebrated tales of Indian cricket, and the innings is ranked the sixth best Test innings ever by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. [53] At the time, the pitch was taking significant turn, and to negate Laxman's free scoring, Australian leg spinner Shane Warne pitched his deliveries into the footmarks outside leg stump. However, such was Laxman's play that he consistently drove the ball through long on for boundaries against the spin, something that is considered to be technically dangerous. When Warne attempted to stop Laxman from scoring by defensively stationing most of the fielders on the leg side ( leg theory ) and bowling outside leg stump, Laxman proceeded to skip down the pitch and drive Warne inside-out through the vacant off side, hitting through the line of a substantially turning ball. Warne later admitted that he was clueless as to how to stop Laxman. Laxman went on to score 65 and 66 in the third and the final Test match at Chennai , which India won by 2 wickets and won the series 2–1. [54] Laxman had great amount of success batting at No.3 in the ODI series that followed the Tests, as he scored 45, 51, 83, 11 and 101 in the five games, thus cementing his spot in the ODI line-up as well. [55] In the Coca-Cola Tri-Series later that year in Sri Lanka, Laxman scored 212 runs in 7 matches with two fifties and a decent average of 36. [56]
West Indies and Australia tours (2002–2004)[ edit ]
Laxman then cemented his place both in the Test and one day teams for a few years. After bad performances in the Test series against Zimbabwe , he did well in the first two ODIs scoring 75 and 52, but couldn't convert the starts into big knocks in the next three matches. Laxman managed to score a fighting 89 in the second Test at Port Elizabeth , when the rest of the team struggled to survive against Shaun Pollock 's deadly bowling, helping his team put up 201 on the board and avoid an embarrassing follow-on. Against the touring England in late 2001, he scored 75, sharing a 100-plus run partnership with Tendulkar to take his team out of trouble. He had a great tour of West Indies , as he scored 474 runs in 8 innings at an average of 79. He had scores of 69, 69*, 74, 1, 43, 130, 65* and 23 in that series. He performed reasonably well during West Indies tour of India as well, particularly in the third match at Kolkata , where he scored 48 and 154*. He followed it up with brilliant showing in the 7-match ODI series as well with scores of 47, 99, 66 and 71 in the first five games. But his form dropped during India's tour of New Zealand in 2002/03. In the first Test at Wellington , he got a pair and in the second match he could score only 23 and 4. However, he had a brilliant 2-match Test series against the same team in India as he scored a half-century along with 44 in the first Test and 104* and 67* in the second match. He won the Man of the Series award for his impressive batting performances in the two Test match series. In October 2003, he scored 102 in the first ODI against Australia at Gwalior , sharing a 190-run second wicket partnership with Tendulkar. However he failed to deliver on a consistent basis in ODIs. He continued to perform well against Australia, especially during India's tour of Australia in 2003–04, in which he hit three ODI and two Test centuries. He was involved in two century partnerships, one with Tendulkar and the other with Dravid, in the Brisbane ODI against Australia where he remained unbeaten on 102. His 106* against the same opponents at Sydney saw him put up a fourth-wicket partnership of 213 runs with Yuvraj Singh , who scored his career-best 139. In the next ODI against Zimbabwe, Laxman scored a 138-ball 131, once again setting up 2 hundred-run stands. He scored 148 in the famous Adelaide Test, sharing a triple century partnership with Rahul Dravid , which India won by 4 wickets. This was their first Test victory in Australia in two decades. His innings of 178 at Sydney also came in a triple century partnership, on this occasion with Sachin Tendulkar . India went on to post 705/7 in their first innings which is their highest total in Test cricket. Laxman scored a total of 494 runs from the 4 Tests at a staggering average of 82. During this series, Ian Chappell described Laxman as Very Very Special Laxman. His 107 (104) against Pakistan in the fifth and the final ODI at Lahore , helped India win by 40 runs and clinch the series 3–2.
Decline of form (2004–2005)[ edit ]
However, Laxman's form was on the decline since the series against Australia. Beginning with the series in Pakistan in 2004, Laxman had only[ clarification needed ] Test centuries to his credit, with one coming against a weak Zimbabwe side. He averaged just 31 in the Test series in Pakistan in 3 matches. His only half-century (71) came in a high-scoring game at Rawalpindi where India made a mammoth 600 to win the game by an innings and 131 runs. He struggled to score in the ODI series in England which put question marks over his future in the shorter format. He struggled against his favourite opponents Australia in the home series in October–November 2004, although his 69 in the low-scoring final Test at Mumbai was instrumental for India to record a consolation victory. He had a mixed Test series against Pakistan in 2005. He scored 58 in the first Test, 0 and 24 in the second and 79* and 5 in the third. He batted well in the Sri Lanka Test series scoring a fifty at Delhi and a crucial century (104) in the last match at Ahmedabad . Laxman was dropped after scoring a duck in the first Test against England at Nagpur in March 2006. He regained his place for the tour of the West Indies in place of the injured Tendulkar, and made a hundred in the third Test. He also scored a resilient 63 in the second innings to deny West Indies the victory in the same match. In ODIs, Laxman was left out persistently since Greg Chappell took over as coach in mid-2005, mainly on account of his slow ground fielding and running between the wickets; Laxman is a highly regarded close-catching fielder in stationary positions but in ODIs, these positions are generally disused except for the opening phases of the match, and players otherwise have to patrol substantial spaces and retrieve balls. Another reason was a perception that his batting is too one paced for ODI cricket and that he lacks the ability to score at a high rate as required when the batting team has the momentum, or in the closing stages of the innings. This was despite his superb form in Australia and Pakistan in early 2004, when he made four centuries in 14 games, including three in a week in the VB Series in Australia.
In December 2005, Laxman helped India to victory against Sri Lanka with a fine century. In June 2006, Laxman again rescued India from a difficult position against the West Indies with a gritty century. In November 2006, he was selected in the test squad for India's tour of South Africa. In the first test in Johannesburg Laxman scored 73 in the second innings to help India claim a historic 123 run win. In the 2007 tour of England Laxman produced three good innings, two of which were half-centuries and a vital 39 that helped India draw the first test at Lords. He passed the 5000 run landmark in the first day of the final test.
After the tests he joined Lancashire as their overseas player in place of Brad Hodge . He played in five games of the county championship and showed glimpses of his sublime batting. In their final County Championship game of 2007, against Surrey at the Oval, Laxman scored a century in the second innings which Lancashire were chasing 489 to win. They just missed out by 25 runs and subsequently lost the Championship to Sussex. His performance for Lancashire was good with 380 runs scored in 5 matches at an average of 54.28 with 2 centuries and 2 half-centuries [57]
In India's home series against Pakistan in 2007, V.V.S. Laxman once again showed his importance to the team with a disciplined batting performance in the 1st Test at Delhi , as he scored 72* in dire circumstances. [58] He then followed that innings of 72 in the first test with 112 in the second test. [59] This ensured his place on the tour of Australia which would be his third to that country.
Sublime form from end of 2007 till May 2011[ edit ]
Laxman's good form continued in the 2007/08 Test series against Australia with him scoring 109 against Australia on the second day of the controversial Sydney Test to put India back into the contest. It was his 12th hundred in Test matches, and his 5th against Australia. It was also his third consecutive century at SCG , giving him an average well above 90 at the venue. He followed this up with a gritty knock of 79 in Perth , assisted by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and RP Singh , which set India up to record a historic and unexpected victory at a ground on which previously no Asian team had won. He hit 51 in the first innings of the final Test at Adelaide. He finished as the second highest run-getter for India in that series, only behind Sachin Tendulkar .
He, like all other Indian batsmen, struggled in Sri Lanka against the spin duo of Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis later in July–August that year. India lost the first Test by an innings and 239 runs at Colombo , where Laxman's first innings score of 50 was the only half-century scored by an Indian batsman in either innings. Laxman scored another fifty in that series, in the third Test, an unbeaten 61 as India went on to lose the game by 8 wickets and the series 2–1. Laxman was dismissed by Mendis on all five occasions in that series. He also crossed the 6000-run milestone during the series.
Laxman was supposed to replace Adam Voges for Nottinghamshire , but this move was vetoed by the BCCI due to the fact that there are players from the rival Indian Cricket League playing for Nottinghamshire.
Against Australia, in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy later that year, Laxman was in top form as he scored 381 runs from 4 Tests with a double-hundred and two fifties. During the third Test at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi, Laxman scored an unbeaten 200 in the first innings with characteristic use of his wrists and flicks through the leg side. In the same innings, Gautam Gambhir scored 206, Laxman and Gambhir becoming the first pair of batsmen to score double-centuries in the same innings for India, and the first to do so against Australia. This was his second double-century in Test cricket with the previous one coming against the same opponents. [60] He made an unbeaten 59 in the second innings and was named Man of the Match. The match was also the last game of India's spin wizard Anil Kumble who was also the captain of the team. In the final Test at Nagpur , Laxman scored another half-century in the first innings of the match.
In 2009, Laxman continued to be in brilliant form. He had scored 76 and 124* in the 2nd Test at Napier in New Zealand. The century helped India salvage a draw and avoid an innings defeat. In the next match at Wellington he hit a well-composed 61 in the second innings. Against Sri Lanka later that year in a home series, Laxman hit three fifties in four innings as India went on to win the series comfortably. His unbeaten 51 in the second innings combining with a hundred from Tendulkar helped India draw the first Test at Ahmedabad . Laxman scored two fifties in the next two games as India went on to win both matches by an innings.
He injured himself during the first match of the two-match Test series in Bangladesh in January 2010 after scoring another unbeaten half-century. The injury forced him to sit out for three weeks and he returned to action only during the final Test against South Africa held in Kolkata . He scored 143* in a record stand for the seventh wicket with MS Dhoni . The test was eventually won by India by an innings and 57 runs in the last 10 minutes of the fifth day's play, despite centuries in both innings from South African batsman Hashim Amla . This victory also helped India draw the Test series and remain the world Number 1 team. He also passed 7000 Test runs during the innings.
Laxman helped India to level the series with Sri Lanka in August 2010 when he hit 103 not out in the run-chase, resulting in a five-wicket win in the Third Test, after scoring 69 in the first innings. He was awarded the Man of the Match for this brilliant effort. He scored a total of 279 runs in that series at an average of 70. [65]
In October, he once again turned around another match that appeared headed for a comfortable Australian victory, in the first Test in Mohali. Laxman was suffering with a back problem and needed Suresh Raina as his runner, and the Indians had collapsed to 124/8 in pursuit of 216. He and paceman Ishant Sharma put on 81 to take the score to 205 before Sharma fell. Last man Pragyan Ojha then managed to survive till the end as the hosts completed a thrilling one-wicket win. Laxman ended on 73 not out. He was ruled out of the remaining matches of the series due to his injury. In November, he helped India recover from 15/5 in the second innings of the first Test against New Zealand at Ahmedabad and the match was drawn. In the second match of the series at his home ground Hyderabad , he scored 74 and the match ended in another draw.
After dismal batting in the first Test of the South African tour, Laxman once again helped India to a historic win at Durban . India struggled to cope with Dale Steyn in the first innings before getting bundled out for 205. Laxman's 38 was the highest score in that innings. In the second innings, India were struggling at 94/5 and he put on crucial partnerships with Dhoni and Zaheer Khan to help his team to 228, giving South Africa a target of 303. South Africa were bundled out for 215 giving India an 87-run win that helped level the series 1–1. He was awarded the Man of the Match for his match-winning innings of 96.
In three test matches, Laxman scored three consecutive fifties including two scores in eighties against the West Indies during India's tour of West Indies in June 2011.
June 2011 to Retirement[ edit ]
During India's Tour to England, Laxman scored just two half-centuries in eight innings as India went down 0–4 to England. This was India's first Test series loss since the 2007/08 India Tour of Australia. Laxman got out with the pull shot frequently in this series, which otherwise he is good at. As part of West Indies tour to India in September 2011, Laxman scored a magnificent 176 not out in the second test, but India had to settle for a draw. Laxman was adjudged Man of the match. India went on to win the series 1–0. Laxman again failed to live to his expectations during India's tour of Australia in November 2011, as India went down 0–4 to Australia with Laxman scoring only two half centuries in eight innings. For the first time in four tours to Australia, Laxman failed to register a century in the series; and also for the first time in four test matches played at Sydney Cricket Ground he failed to touch the three figure mark. Post this series, there were calls from the media and former Cricketers that it was time for the seniors like Laxman, Dravid and Sachin to take a call on their international career.
Indian Premier League[ edit ]
Laxman was originally named as the Icon Player for his home franchise Deccan Chargers before the first season of IPL. But he gave up the Icon Player status in a bid to allow his team spend a bigger purse at the auction. The Deccan Chargers bought him at the auction for $375,000 and named him the captain for the first season. However, Laxman dropped himself from the team halfway through the season, after the team had a horrendous in the tournament. Adam Gilchrist took over as the captain and led the side in the next two seasons as well. Although, Laxman did scored 155 runs from the 6 games that he played at an average of 31 and strike rate of 118. He batted at 3 in the first few games before opening the innings with Gilchrist in some matches where he found more success. His only half-century of the tournament (52 off 44) came against Royal Challengers Bangalore . He did score a couple more of fluent innings that season including the unbeaten 37 from 26 balls against the Mumbai Indians and 48 from 34 balls against Kings XI Punjab . However, he struggled with the bat in the next two seasons and sat out of the tournament after playing only 5–6 matches.
At the mega-auction in 2011, Laxman was bought by the newly formed franchise of Kochi Tuskers Kerala for $400,000. This time, though, he was injured after the first three games and missed the rest of the season. In the first match against Royal Challengers, he opened the innings with Brendon McCullum and scored an attractive 36 from 29 deliveries. But, the Kochi franchise was terminated later that year and all the players of the team were put in the auction in 2012. However, Laxman, who had a base price of $400,000, found no buyers and he couldn't participate in the 2012 edition of the tournament.Then in IPL 2013, he was appointed as a mentor for Sunrisers Hyderabad Team.
Retirement[ edit ]
On 18 August 2012, Laxman announced his retirement from international cricket. Although he was selected for the upcoming New Zealand series, he opted not to play in the series but he will play in domestic cricket for Hyderabad and the Indian Premier League . [8] [66] [67] It was announced that the Northern Stand at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium will now be named after him. [68]
