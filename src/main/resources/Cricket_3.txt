Early life[ edit ]
Kumar Sangakkara was born to Kumari Surangana and Swarnakumara Sangakkara, an attorney-at-law at Matale , Sri Lanka in 1977. [25] His parents settled in Kandy , where he grew up in his childhood. Kumara received his primary and secondary education at Trinity College , Kandy , an independent elite private boys' school situated in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. He has two sisters: Thushari and Saranga, and an elder brother: Vemindra, all who have made national level achievements during their school-life. Sangakkara too started playing a number of sports: badminton, tennis, swimming, table tennis and cricket at the junior school. He was able to win national colours for badminton and tennis at his younger age. The then principal of the Trinity College, Leonard de Alwis, advised his mother to encourage Kumara to concentrate on cricket. [26]
His parents hid Tamil families during the Black July riots in 1983. [27]
He represented his school's under-13 cricket XI under coach Upananda Jayasundera. [25] Berty Wijesinghe coached Sangakkara for under-15, under-17, under-19 and first XI squads. [28] He was awarded The Trinity Lion , the most prestigious prize awarded to a Trinity sportsman, for his exceptional batting and wicket-keeping skills in the 1996 season, at the age of 19. [29] Sangakkara was selected to represent Sri Lanka A cricket team at a tour to South Africa in 1998–99. His knock of unbeaten 156 against Zimbabwe A team at a one-day match, [30] helped him secure a place at the Sri Lankan national cricket team later that year.
Sanga was the Senior Prefect (Head Boy) of school, he did his Advanced Level examination in the Arts stream in 1996. He was also awarded the highest honour of Trinity College, the Ryde Gold Medal , for the best all-round student in his year. Following his father, who is a lawyer in Kandy, he entered the Law Faculty of the University of Colombo , but was unable to finish his degree due to cricket tours. [31] Kumara was a chorister and played the violin during his school-days. [32] He was cited as an inspiration to continue his higher education by Bangladeshi captain Mushfiqur Rahim , upon receiving his Master's degree:
It is appreciated that someone like Sangakkara's sports personality is shaped by his education. He is obviously an inspiration. [33]
Early career[ edit ]
At the age of 22 Sangakkara made his Test debut on 20 July 2000, keeping wicket in the first fixture of a three-match series against South Africa . Sri Lanka won the match and in his side's only innings Sangakarra batted at the fall of the third wicket and scored 23 runs before he was dismissed leg before wicket by spin bowler Nicky Boje . [34] He made 35 runs in his One day cricket debut [35] [36] against Pakistan and he received his first man of the match award in the 2nd match of the Singer Triangular Series, 2000, scoring 85 runs against South Africa. [37] He ended the series with 199 runs, at an average of 66.33, securing his place for the upcoming Test series against South Africa. Before reaching his first Test century , he was twice dismissed in the 90s, once against each of South Africa and England. In August 2001, India toured Sri Lanka for three Tests and in the opening match Sangakkara scored his first century. [38] His innings of 105 not out at number three helped set up a ten-wicket victory for Sri Lanka. [39] Later that year Sangakkara scored his second Test century, this time in the first of three matches against the touring West Indians . [40]
He scored his first double-century against Pakistan in 2002, at the 2nd Asian Test Championship final. [41] His performance helped Sri Lanka secure the Test championship. In April 2003, Sangakkara made his first ODI century against Pakistan, in a losing effort. [42] Together with Marvan Atapattu , he made a partnership of 438 for the 2nd wicket—4th highest in the world—against Zimbabwe in 2004. [43] In that game, he scored 270, his first 250+ score. [44] In July 2005, he was selected to the ICC World XI ODI team but missed out from its Test counterpart .
As vice-captain[ edit ]
Sangakkara (right) resigned the captaincy after the 2011 World Cup and was succeeded by Tillakaratne Dilshan (left).
When Sri Lanka toured Bangladesh in February 2006 regular captain Marvan Atapattu was injured and Mahela Jayawardene became captain while Sangakkara was made vice-captain. [45] Pakistan toured Sri Lanka for two Test and three ODIs in March 2006, and with Atapattu still injured Jayawardene and Sangakkara remained captain and vice-captain respectively. [46] The pair had only expected to hold the positions on an interim basis, but extended into a third series as Atapattu failed to recover in time to tour England in April and ended up filling the roles full-time. [47] In July 2006, Sangakkara made his second-highest Test score to-date (287) against South Africa. In a record-breaking partnership with Mahela Jayawardene, he set up the world record for the highset partnership in Test cricket—624 runs—in this match. [48]
On 6 December 2007 he made it to the top spot of ICC Test player rankings with a rating of 938, the highest rating ever achieved by a Sri Lankan player, and became the first batsman ever to score in excess of 150 in four consecutive tests. [25] His skill was recognised worldwide when he earned selection for the ICC World XI One Day International team that competed against Australia in the Johnnie Walker Series in October 2005. Despite the World XI losing all of the one-day games by considerable margins, Sangakkara left the series with some credit, averaging 46. He was one of the winners of the 2008 inaugural Cricinfo awards for outstanding batting in Test cricket. [49]
Sangakkara holds the record for being the fastest man to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 (jointly held), 11,000 and 12,000 runs in Test cricket. During Sri Lanka's tour to England in May 2006, he was named the vice-captain of the side. On 3 March 2009, a terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team convoy in Pakistan injured 6 Sri Lankan players including Sangakkara. Sangakkara suffered shrapnel wounds in his shoulder. [50] In November 2006, Sangakkara was included in the ICC World XI Test team. Next year, he signed an agreement to join Warwickshire County Cricket Club . [51] That year, he scored back-to-back double centuries in Tests and became only the fifth cricketer in the history to do so. [52]

In February 2009, the then captain of the Sri Lankan side, Mahela Jayawardene announced that he would step down from captaincy "in the best interests of the Sri Lankan team". He said he believed that it would give his successor around two years to build up to the 2011 Cricket World Cup . [56] Therefore at the age of 31 and with the experience of 80 Tests and 246 ODIs, Sangakkara succeeded Jayawardene as Sri Lanka's captain in all formats of the game. His first engagement in the role was the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 hosted by England in June. [57] Sri Lanka became runners-up in the series after winning all the game in group and knock-out stages and being defeated by Pakistan in the final. Sangakkara made 64 not-out in the final, but was unable to take Sri Lanka for the championship. [58] Sri Lanka failed to reach to the knock-out stage of the ICC Champions Trophy in September 2009. The next Indian tour proved to be disastrous for the team, with Sri Lanka being beaten by India in Test series 2–0 and ODI series 3–1.
Sri Lankan team under the captaincy of Sangakkara gained momentum and won the next Tri-series in Bangladesh , Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka , beating India as well. The Sri Lankans' tour of Australia proved to be very successful, in winning both the T20 and ODI series. This was Sri Lanka's first ever series victory in Australia. [59]
A month in advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the captaincy after the tournament. [60] Sri Lanka reached the final of the tournament. [61] Throughout the tournament Sangakkara was in prolific form with the bat scoring 465 runs from 9 matches and was the third highest run scorer behind team-mate Tillakaratne Dilshan and India's Sachin Tendulkar . Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams. He offered to continue as Test captain if deemed necessary for transition to new skipper, [62] but Dilshan was appointed captain across all formats. [63] Reflecting on the decision afterwards, he said that "captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly ... It's rarely a job you will last long in ... I also had a two-year stint, and I enjoyed it at times, certainly on the field where our results showed we were one of the top two sides in the world for one-and-a-half years, especially in the shorter form of the game." [60]
The same year, he was named the ODI Cricketer of the Year at the ICC awards ceremony . [64] In 2012, he was honoured as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year . [65]

Sri Lanka's first fixture after the World Cup was a Sri Lanka tour of England in 2011 beginning in May. During the second match of a three Test series Tillakaratne Dilshan , Sangakkara's successor as captain, suffered a broken thumb. Sangakkara filled-in while Dilshan was off the pitch and formally assumed the captaincy for the final Test. [66] [67] The match ended in a draw and the series ended in a 1–0 victory for England; Sangakarra scored a century in the match, his first against England in nine Tests. [68]

Sri Lanka later won the Test match. He followed this up with 192 in the game, again missing out on the double century. Sri Lanka drew the next two matches meaning Sri Lanka won the series 1–0.

Playing style[ edit ]
Sangakkara is a left-handed top order batsman who likes to hit the ball square of the wicket on the off-side. While the cut and the pull are natural strokes to him, he tends to play off the front foot. The cover drive is one of his regular scoring shots. Sangakkara averages 58.66 in Test cricket. In ODI cricket, he retired with an average of 42. [115] Sangakkara handed over his wicket-keeping duty to Prasanna Jayawardene in Tests cricket in 2009. He currently plays as a specialist batsman in Tests, and retired as a wicket keeper-batsman in other formats of the game. He is the first in the list of wicket keepers who contributed to the most number of dismissals in ODI cricket, With 499. He is also the wicket keeper with highest number of stumpings—99—in ODI cricket. [116]
He has won a certain degree of admiration for his clever use of sledging and is one of few cricketers who are willing to talk about it openly. In an interview in 2004 he explained his approach to sledging:
The public perception of sledging is to go out there and abuse someone in obscene language, questioning their parentage or sexual preferences. That kind of abuse does not belong on the field of play. Sledging, as coined and pioneered by the Australians, is a measured comment designed to get a reaction out of a player. It could be any reaction: a bit of anger, a show of arrogance, a comment, a shake of the head, or a slump of the shoulders.
