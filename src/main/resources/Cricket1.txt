Sri Lanka v India, 2nd Test, P Sara Oval, 5th day August 24, 2015
Excellent India get the job done, finally
At Galle India played the near-perfect Test, only to see their efforts come to naught with a late stumble. At the P Sara Oval, they went all the way in some style

In Galle , India came excruciatingly close to the perfect Test: it began with their bowlers, was followed through by their batsmen in the first innings, and then they were as good as home with half the Sri Lankan line-up dismantled by the third afternoon. Then, however, they were hit by a dangerous cocktail: a batting performance out of an action comic, inexperience, and a brain and feet freeze in chase of 176. The match left the Indians clutching empty air, trying to work out answer a complex algebraic equation - how did seven sessions to India and three to Sri Lanka end up with three growing larger than seven?
Within the space of five days, though, India found their moorings again and were able to restart and go on to efficiently finish what they had set out to do in Galle: play the perfect five-day game; win their hyperactive, energised, fellow "bro" of a captain his first Test as leader. If defeat in Galle was "heartbreaking", as R Ashwin called it, victory at the P Sara Oval was sweet relief. This is India's first win after the stunner at Lords in 2014 , and will reconfirm their belief in what they think of as their "brand" of cricket - five bowlers, 20 wickets, aggression, intent, fearlessness.
The five bowlers and 20 wickets part of the equation was never considered a problem in Galle, either by Kohli or team director Ravi Shastri, because from where they saw it, despite Dinesh Chandimal's innings, their bowlers had given them the 20 wickets. It was for the batsmen to run with their side of the bargain. At the P Sara Oval, the roles were reversed: it was up to the batsmen to give the bowlers some numbers to bowl against and they did so, both times. Kohli said the victory was "satisfying especially knowing we came pretty close twice before - in Adelaide and Galle. We've spoken about that, if you win six sessions in a game, you expect your side to win the game. I think Galle hurt us in that way." He complimented his side for being able "to get yourself together, put yourself in and play the same way again".
Play the same way again. This meant not wiping clean the memories of Galle, but two other things: finding a way to reduce the emotional bruising from that game, and performing a forensic analysis of the defeat and identifying the most useful clues as to how that particular cricketing accident occurred.
One problem area from Galle identified and addressed by the batsmen in Colombo was their ability to keep the game moving along without risk or reservation. Moving forward and ahead, using their feet to scuttle length, and turning the forward defensive into singles. KL Rahul's century in the first innings, in which he took on the Sri Lankan spinners, was one example, that too from a batsman who had scores of 7 and 5 in the first match. With reference to the bowlers, it was two things: drying up runs by holding their "shape" when it came to lines, and tackling a counterattacks by switching tactics quickly if Plan A wasn't working. At one point on day two at the P Sara, there were no boundaries to be had off the Indian bowling across 113 balls - more than 18 overs.
Also key to their strategy of being able to play five bowlers (or in this case, four and a half, as Ravi Shastri put it) alongside only six specialist batsmen, was the lower order contributing with the bat. At the P Sara, led by legspinner Amit Mishra, this was done. In the first innings, the final four Indian wickets added 74; in the second innings, when pushing for quick runs to enlarge the target, the lower five aggregated 63.
There was another element in play at the P Sara. Kohli said he wanted to use the collective intelligence of his team and have his team-mates do the same. And this is what was behind the constant chatter between Kohli and his team, whether it was M Vijay stepping in with suggestions to the bowler or Rohit Sharma offering Kohli his opinions. "I want guys to be more expressive and I want guys to share their ideas with me. I want them to speak their mind because they are intelligent cricketers." The single cause was, he said, winning: "By speaking their mind, some ideas strike me. I might not be able to think about them because there is so much going on. We want to make the guys feel more responsible and more involved in the game throughout. They are thinking about the game every over, which is a good thing for the team."
One of the most memorable parts of P Sara Test, though, was not about how quickly the Indians were able to claim the last eight Sri Lankan wickets - in the course of a session and a bit. It was about what they did afterwards. When the final wicket fell, the team's celebrations were joyful but not overblown. A set of hugs and handshakes among each other, stumps collected as souvenirs, and the rapid realisation that their victory would mean a very painful defeat for the home side in Kumar Sangakkara's final Test.
Once they had acknowledged each other, as if the switch had been flipped, Kohli and his men retreated into the shadows. The Sri Lankans gave Sangakkara the farewell they wanted to and the Indians gave the occasion the respect it deserved. They stood to one side during his farewell function, Kohli presented Sangakkara with his shirt signed by the team. They returned to their dressing room and let him soak in his last few hours as a Sri Lankan player. No loud noise or wild celebrations there. Some of the players left for their hotel, others stayed back and played a few hours of badminton.
The series-levelling victory will continue to give strength to the structure that Kohli wants his team to take, in terms of team composition and the choice of personnel. He has virtually announced that Cheteshwar Pujara will be drafted in as an opener for the third Test, and that the batting order will be shuffled. Kohli's captaincy is minus any euphemisms about revival or rebuilding. He understands cricket in its simplest language. Runs and wickets, winning over losing.

Some people never give credit when it's due. India was excellent in this match and there is no doubt about it. Does it make them the best team? NO.
There are still lots of gaps and that's ok. Very few teams in the history were flawless. Yes SL has a very raw team but India is also not a finished product. But what one should appreciete is that they are on the correct path. Attitude is to play positive and win. Skills will eventually improve, gaps will gradually fill and the team will become better. Cherish what we have now.
rappedonthepads on August 25, 2015, 11:55 GMT
I certainly like the look of Kohli's test side. love the 5 bowlers approach though Binny seems a bit of a compromise. We'll lose some but  there is surely merit in being proactive. If only we open ourselves to DRS, then we wouldn't have to lose test matches like the first one. Pujara, Vijay, Rahane, Rohit, Kohli, Rahul, Dhawan- Wow really brave that 2 out of these 7 would sit out for Saha to be at 6. Of course if Rahul does a Dravid...another story that.
FrostD on August 25, 2015, 11:40 GMT
Yes India has won, and I'm very happy, but let's keep in mind that this is not a major accomplishment at all. India has played a Sri Lankan side that is still trying to figure out every single position in their Test team, in fact, I have my doubts if they will win a test match against Bangla Desh if played right now. It was a SL side that was trying to cope with the fact that it was Sanga's last game. The next game, they will try to figure out how to fill Sanga's void. So, India should definitely have the upper hand.  It was India's fault that they lost the first one.  Here is an observation, it is either lack of planning or perhaps sheer bad timing, but there is almost no icons left in the SL team to guide the next generation.  When Tendulkar had retired, the Indian team already had Kohli, Pujara and Vijay as established players. Of course India also had Dhoni to guide the younger generation. Something senior cricketers should think about before retiring...
Cric__Dude on August 25, 2015, 10:45 GMT
India still got lot of things to improve on. And I think they will. One of the concerns is the support staff. I definitely want to see a change in the whole support staff. Split coaching is a complete NO from my side. Still early days for Kohli but he is doing alright. I just hope he will gets flexible with his plans in case things don't work out.
on August 25, 2015, 10:44 GMT
Overwhelming Indian fans could be put on hot plate with next game. who knows what will happen last game as we have seen Indian side's failover and collapse in first game. Stay tune and series win could fall in any side
WeirdBeard420 on August 25, 2015, 10:40 GMT
"Excellent India" get the job done!   LOLOLOL!!!  OK, they win three, maybe four, Tests in the past five years, and suddenly they're "Excellent India" HAHAHA!!  I guess that makes Canada the #1 ODI side in the world for their marvellous victory over Bangladesh in the World Cup in 2003...
Amit on August 25, 2015, 10:38 GMT
Let's not eulogise too much, Sharda! Yes, credit must be given to the team, and yes, it is well-deserved. Having said that, I am sure that Virat himself of all people will know that his is a flawed squad, which is playing another flawed team. It is quite probable that by the time the third test is over, India might have lost again. Whilst die-hard fans may want them to win, this team, much like their predecessors of yore, doesn't inspire confidence. They are correctly placed at number 6 in the world rankings!
paddynair on August 25, 2015, 10:09 GMT
When you win,all is "hunky-dory".I thought that India were tentative and defensive on the 4th day and did not declare on time.They played Stuart Binny to "protect the batting" and that had no bearing on the result whatever,though Binny did his best.The weakness of India is the inability to take 20 wickets which Kohli has rightly assessed.In the absence of a kapil dev or Kallis,they have to push the burden to the batsmen,if they are to win overseas on a consistent basis
mjrvasu on August 25, 2015, 10:09 GMT
Without being disrespectful to the Lanka lions, I think we should not make a big deal out of this Test win by India.  Yes, it is a win after a long, long time - but certainly not against some world class opposition.  It remains to be seen how consistent this side will be in the near future.  One feels a bit sad for Sanga not having been on the winning side in his last essay, but that is only a mere statistics figure, and cannot dwarf the greatness in that cricketer.

I appreciate the comments from the Indian and SriLankan cricket fans, their knowledge in Test Cricket and above all their humility.

Smart_animesh on August 25, 2015,  9:47 GMT
I hope this the start for India winning Tests in foreign conditions. BCCI should hire good bowling coaches to address the fitness and rhythm issues of fast bowlers. We need a good spin bowling coach too. Dhoni's rigid captaincy made cricket fans like us awfully sad. Hope time will change now...
niazbhi on August 25, 2015,  9:01 GMT
India has talents(probably more than any other country barring Australia)... I still think india would suffer from attitudes that values hype more than substance...
Vikram Singh on August 25, 2015,  8:45 GMT
I think kohli has been unlucky. He could have been won more matches. But anyway good luck for future.
OneTipOneHand on August 25, 2015,  8:27 GMT
I'm hoping the exuberance of this well earned win doesn't blind us to the fact that the batting still looks fragile. Not once have the Indians put up a score of 400 yet - they may get away with it for a while, but it's a worrying sign. As for the tail 74 in the first innings and 63 in the second won't really count for much when the team finds itself 5 down for 150. And that will happen, sooner rather than later. I have a nasty feeling the 3rd test might just prove me right!
Cric_smashers on August 25, 2015,  8:03 GMT
To be honest, winning this test in SL was only quarter as demanding as defeating teams like england in england...
Naresh28 on August 25, 2015,  7:22 GMT
At the same time we should also wait and see how Kohli does on outside the sub-cont. Lets not blame Dhoni as on the SC we were winning games but not outside. If there is one player who needs to buck up its Rohit Sharma by moving Rahane up the order a problem has been solved with that no3 slot. Mishra has also shown on the SC he can be useful. The 5 bowler policy has worked. A TEAM EFFORT win.
John.cric.lover on August 25, 2015,  7:03 GMT
I like Virats positive attitude, and his vision about how he wants to take the team forward. Wish him all the best.  I was once a hater, coz of his abusive showman attitude... Glad to see him mature and the best thing is his honest joy in others performances... Hes a complete team man...
on August 25, 2015,  6:47 GMT
India's bowling was made to look excellent by Kohli's field placements. He virtually had four men on the boundary (sweeper, thirdman, fine leg and square leg). It gave enough protection for a bowling line up that cannot bowl six balls in one spot (barring Ashwin). A lot of the commentary team was going on about the "easy single" but Virat Kohli's fielding set up ensured that we didn't leak too many runs and we were also attacking all the time. Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma and Amit Mishra can be expected to bowl only four good balls in an over. They will be short and wide for atleast two balls and Kohli is realistic enough to understand what he has at his disposal. I am glad that in the name of "attacking brand of cricket" Kohli isn't setting up four slips two gullies kind of fields. When we get bowlers who can bowl six balls on a length we could think of that.
Rahul_78 on August 25, 2015,  5:34 GMT
There is a bit of Virender Sehwagnes about Kohlis captaincy. A philosophy of playing the ball and not the opposition, keeping it simple and playing with abundant freedom and natural aggression without the fear of the failure. MSD has been absolutely great for Indian cricket but in latter part one always got the feeling that he was happy with draws and and odd victories in test cricket. This team under Kohli and Shastri has been breath of fresh air.
on August 25, 2015,  5:23 GMT
@MK49_VAN - You're right. My bad. Just that the non-mention of Ashwin's contribution to the win (in contrast to the mention of batsmen by name) rankled me.
mrgupta on August 25, 2015,  5:16 GMT
@KEEPITHONEST: I think you are not giving enough credit to the team which they deserve. No team is lucky, they have to play to win. By your logic England got lucky as Aus are not the powerhouse, Bangaldesh got lucky as India and Pak are not the powerhouse they once were and so on. Its not luck, its the application and talent.
Sir_Ivor on August 25, 2015,  4:56 GMT
Someone compared Karun Nair with Sachin of 1989 and Rahul Dravid of 1996. I am not sure if this comparison is a balanced one. Nair is good no doubt and obviously has the backing of some people whose opinion matters. But I wish we would hold our praise  a bit because expectations can soar unjustifiably
on August 25, 2015,  4:14 GMT
A Very good win. India atlast has found the right bowling combination. Binny can be replaced may be with jadeja or Axar Patel if the wicket is more spin oriented and or with a batsman if its going to be a bowlers wicket with Rohit Vijay and Kohli turning their arms over. Also very happy for Mishra who took his 50th wkt in tests and bowling and batting with large heart. An ieal combination of spin-Ashwin and Mishra.The competition between pace bowlers for a place in the tea is also a good sign.Already this bunch looks good. Ad Shami to this and India i think after many years have a good bowling attack.
Rajiv_Raghunath on August 25, 2015,  3:58 GMT
The 5-bowler approach is ideal for winning tests overseas. However, Bhuvaneshwar should take the place of Binny considering that Bhuvaneshwar has already score 3 test fifties and has a decent first class batting average. He is no doubt a superior bowler too. On the batting front Pujara deserves a slot in the XI although there is some urgency to fastrack the talented  Karun Nair into the test arena.
mk49_van on August 25, 2015,  3:53 GMT
@Sreekanth Meeankshi - read the article, will you? Ms. Ugra was praising Mishra leading with the *bat*  and vindicating the 5 bowler model.  His 20 odd runs in the first innings made crucial contribution in giving India a solid lead.
on August 25, 2015,  2:49 GMT
Great win!! Keep winning guys!!
on August 25, 2015,  2:37 GMT
Well, Sharda Ugra at her 'best'. With Dhoni out of the way, no issues praising the new captain and the new team. But Ashwin is still there? Well, let's work around that and make the Indian bowling attack "led by Amit Mishra"! Deep rooted antipathy is deep rooted.
glen1 on August 25, 2015,  2:15 GMT
The one that got away needs a lot of introspection.  Indian bowlers and captains lose their mind when the other side gets aggressive.  Till the Test team proves that it can wrest the initiative back, it is a mediocre team at best.  Just blaming team selection and specific bowlers will not cut it; it is the fear psychosis that needs to be beaten out.
Cricket_Loving_Indian on August 25, 2015,  1:22 GMT
@KeepitHonest- It's not Kohli's fault that Sri Lanka is a small nation. And as you have mentioned, Sri Lanka managed to win the first test match, which means their team is talented as well, thereby implying that this test match win IS an achievement. No one is saying that Kohli has become the greatest captain of all time, he's just being given due credit for winning his first test match as the Indian captain.
on August 25, 2015,  0:45 GMT
i like kohlis attacking captaincy. in test matches he is a better captain than dhoni who was very defensive.ashwin who is an attacking bowler by nature was asked to bowl defensively by dhoni especially abroad. that is why ashwin did not perform upto expectations outside india. but kohli asks ashwin to bowl attacking lines and ashwin is bowling beautifully. i am sure india will perform better here onwards even abroad in test matches.
KeepitHonest on August 25, 2015,  0:40 GMT
We must remember, give the size and scope of Sri Lanka's cricketing machinery not to mention the size of the nation and it's population, it's no great feat to have beaten them. Yes they have produced world beating teams in the past but a country with a shallow resource pool canot be expected to sustain the quality non-stop indefinitely. They are going through a lean phase while rebuilding and looking more like the island nation team they are instead the powerhouse they have been. Kohli got lucky, the timing of his visit was just right. Despite that, Kohli lost one.
IndianInnerEdge on August 24, 2015, 22:49 GMT
good read...but 5 bowlers stragegy apart - can we invest in a true pace bowling all rounder unless binny suddenly morphs into a true test wicket taking bowler?
on August 24, 2015, 21:10 GMT
I am fully impressed with Kohli's captaincy, especially about his flexibility to change a plan in the midst of a game or a session, if that ain't working.  This was something missing in Dhoni's captaincy especially when we played abroad.  Though I am a huge fan of Dhoni's unorthodox approach to captaincy, I think Virat understands the basics Test match cricket very clearly and seems to be the more flexible with his approach.  Great work boys and get a well deserved series win in Colombo!!!
on August 24, 2015, 19:54 GMT
Yes indeed, true winner remains humble in victory. As an Indian cricket lover I sincery appreciate the gesture of Team India and Virat to honour Sangga on his last Test appearance.It is a welcome presendence set by this bunch of young Indians. The letter Virat wrote to Sangga has made this Test memorable.
