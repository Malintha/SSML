Ravichandran Ashwin's 17 wickets in two Tests has helped India look Sri Lanka in the eye in the ongoing three-match series. Ashwin's five for 42 in the second innings paved the way for a mammoth series-levelling Indian win at the P Sara Oval in Colombo on Monday. Former spin wizard Muttiah Muralitharan predicts there is more to come from the Tamil Nadu off-spinner.( Match Report | Scorecard | Highlights )
Monday's spell that forced Sri Lankan batsmen to choose false strokes was one of the best Ashwin has bowled in his 27-match Test career . Retired legend Muralitharan, who has taken 800 Test wickets in 133 matches, credited Ashwin for using the rather grassy P. Sara Oval wicket intelligently.
"The good thing about Ashwin is that he is flighting the ball. This is the biggest difference (from what he did in Australia). He also got bounce and that got him the wickets," Muralitharan said on TV, adding that the ball that got Kumar Sangakkara out caught in the slips was a "classical" off-spinner's delivery.
Ashwin's 17 wickets in Sri Lanka is a record and Murali is impressed. "He has really done well for himself and Ashwin should play another 10 years for India," the Sri Lankan spin-king professed.
"He is 28 now and if can play a 100 Test matches, he would have picked up at least 600-700 wickets," Murali added. Ashwin, who will turn 29 on September 17, has 141 wickets from 27 Tests so far.
If you are an Indian spinner, comparisons with the Big Three - Bedi, Prasanna and Chandrasekhar - is inevitable. Is Ashwin in the same class then?
Sunil Gavaskar, always safe and sure, said: "Ashwin has pushed the door open." The future looks good for Ashwin.
