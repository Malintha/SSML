A certain young musical genius - some claim it was Bach, others swear it was Brahms - liked to sleep in. As the rest of his family started their day, tugging on wigs and lacing up corsets, this particular lad preferred to snooze, dreaming of concerti.

Nothing would rouse him. Not bells or the creak of carts outside or the bleats of goats or parents or nannies. But his genius made him vulnerable to music. And so his father would sit down at the family piano and play a dominant seventh.

The dominant seventh is a simple progression of four notes, forming a chord that ends in a tantalising question mark. It's the "Aaaah!" build-up in the Beatles' "Twist and Shout". It is the piano soundtrack to that scene in the silent movie where the detective is pushing open the door to the secret cellar.

You and I feel it as a build-up of momentum, a mental itch that needs scratching. But for the young maestro, completing the musical phrase felt like a physical imperative. And so, the story goes, he would throw himself out of bed, storm downstairs and bang down a final chord on the piano to resolve that terrible, hanging question mark.

I thought about the young German genius just before tea on the first day of the recent Test in Chittagong. Faf du Plessis had just been torpedoed by Shakib Al Hasan and had collapsed forward with that theatrical slump that batsmen perform when they have been beaten and don't mind who knows it. The 11 Bangladeshis on the field celebrated, the 19 Bangladeshis in the stands celebrated even more, and du Plessis trudged off.

The stage was set. The dominant seventh had been played. We were ready to hear not only a grand resolution to that particular phrase but hours of sweet music afterwards. We were ready for AB de Villiers.

Those same politics that should apparently never interfere with sport have created a country in which de Villiers is free to express his genius

But de Villiers wasn't there. He was back in South Africa, given leave to be present for the birth of his first child. And so the chord hung and hung. Temba Bavuma played with character and maturity to spare the Proteas embarrassment, but in that moment I think I understood the young composer's angst. Because de Villiers is South Africa's resolution, our relief; the emphatic line drawn under the Proteas' statement of intent.

In retrospect, the clues were everywhere, most recently at the World Cup. But perhaps I could be forgiven for not seeing them. During World Cups, we South Africans tend to grow thick scales of pre-emptive disappointment over our eyes. Every silver lining is smothered by a large cloud. The glass isn't even half-empty: it has been knocked over and is lying broken on the floor in shards, reflecting a host of past disappointments - 22 runs off one ball, Lara, Donald-Klusener, Pollock's sumsâ€¦ In that fog of pessimism it was easy to discount de Villiers' purple patch as a fluke.

But there is another, more complex reason why we might not be seeing de Villiers with the same adoring clarity of his Indian fans. It is simply that we have been waiting for our true champion for so long that we are reluctant to believe he has arrived, in case it's not true and we are disappointed all over again.

I remember when I was initiated into South Africa's messianic cult of the batting champion; when I learned to pray for his return. It was the mid-1980s. I was eight or nine and I didn't know what cricket was or that my officially white supremacist country wasn't allowed to play it against other countries. But my father took me aside and showed the mysteries to me anyway. There were many cricketers, he revealed, but there were only three batsmen. One was Denis Compton, whom he had seen play at Newlands. The second was Neil Harvey. (I am not sure if my father had seen him in the flesh, but I was relieved he had never got too close to him because, it seemed, Harvey ate South Africans whole, gorging on them like a Cyclops in a fire-lit cave.) And finally - here his expression softened - there was Graeme Pollock: the beautiful golden boy, bareheaded, a temporary loan from cricket's gods, to be worshipped for a few brief seasons before reality and realpolitik intervened.
